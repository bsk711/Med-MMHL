0,"July 7, 2022 – Pharmacists can now prescribe Paxlovid, Pfizer’s COVID-19 antiviral pill, directly to patients.

The FDA revised the drug’s emergency use authorization on Wednesday, letting state-licensed pharmacists screen patients and determine if they are eligible for Paxlovid, according to The Associated Press.

Previously, only doctors could prescribe the antiviral drug, the AP reported. With some limits, pharmacists can now prescribe the medication for patients who face high risks for severe COVID-19.

“The FDA recognizes the important role pharmacists have played and continue to play in combatting this pandemic,” Patrizia Cavazzoni, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

“Since Paxlovid must be taken within five days after symptoms begin, authorizing state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid could expand access to timely treatment for some patients who are eligible to receive this drug for the treatment of COVID-19,” she said.

Tom Kraus, the vice president of government relations at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, said in a statement that the organization was “pleased to see the FDA remove this barrier to patients’ access to this critical treatment.”",0
1,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — More than 107,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. Sadly, 20 people die every day while waiting for a lifesaving transplant. Mayo Clinic recently launched an online campaign with the goal of registering 600 more people to be organ donors.

""While 95 percent of Americans say they are in favor of being an organ donor, only 58 percent are registered,"" says Dr. J.P. Scott, medical director of Mayo Clinic's William J. von Liebig Transplant Center in Rochester. ""It only takes a few minutes to register online or check the box on a driver's license application to become a registered donor. This simple and generous act of letting one's wishes be known has the potential to truly save lives.""

April is National Donate Life Month, which encourages people to register to be organ, eye and tissue donors, and honor those who have given the gift of life. In addition to encouraging people to register to become organ donors, Mayo Clinic has several other activities planned this month to raise awareness about the need for organ donation. They include:
• Raising the Donate Life flag at both the Mayo Clinic Hospitals – Rochester, Saint Marys Campus and Methodist Campus Monday, April 12.
• Lighting the Plummer Building in downtown Rochester blue and green in honor of National Donate Life Blue and Green Day on Friday, April 16. Some Mayo Clinic Health System locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin will also be lighting their buildings. On Blue and Green Day, individuals are encouraged to wear blue and green to promote the importance of registering to be an organ donor.
• Mayo Clinic Transplant Center will join LifeSource and the Gift of Life Transplant House in hosting a virtual ""Walk of Remembrance"" tribute to organ, eye and tissue donors and their families on April 30 as part of National Donor Day. In addition, luminarias lit blue and green will be placed along 2nd Street Southwest between Saint Marys Hospital and Gift of Life Transplant House.

Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant provider in the nation. Every year, Mayo Clinic surgeons perform more than 2,000 solid organ and bone marrow transplants in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. Mayo Clinic has both adult and pediatric transplant programs, offering heart, liver, kidney, lung, hand, face and blood and bone marrow transplant services.

3,"June 10, 2022 -- Infants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the womb are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in the first year of life, new research suggests. But whether it is exposure to the pandemic or maternal exposure to the virus itself that may harm early childhood neurodevelopment is unclear, caution investigators, led by Roy Perlis, MD, with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""In this analysis of 222 offspring of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared with the offspring of 7,550 mothers in the control group (not infected) delivered during the same period, we observed neurodevelopmental diagnoses to be significantly more common among exposed offspring, particularly those exposed to third-trimester maternal infection,"" they write. The study was published online June 9 in JAMA Network Open. The study included 7,772 mostly singleton live births across six hospitals in Massachusetts between March and September 2020, including 222 (2.9%) births to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during pregnancy. In all, 14 of 222 children born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers (6.3%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder in the first year of life vs 227 of 7550 unexposed offspring (3%). When factors such as preterm delivery, race, ethnicity, insurance status, child sex, and the mother's age were taken into account, COVID-exposed babies were significantly more likely to receive a neurodevelopmental diagnosis in the first year of life. The association with neurodevelopmental disorders was even greater with third-trimester SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of these diagnoses reflected developmental disorders of movement or speech and language. The researchers note the finding of an association between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and neurodevelopmental diagnoses at 12 months are in line with a ""large body of literature"" linking maternal viral infection and the mother's immune response with infants' neurodevelopmental disorders later in life. They caution, however, that whether a definitive connection exists between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and adverse neurodevelopment in babies is not yet known, in part because children born to women infected in the first wave of the pandemic haven't reached their second birthday, a time when neurodevelopment disorders such as autism are typically diagnosed.

There is also the chance that the findings could be biased because infected mothers who were ill during pregnancy may be more inclined to seek medical evaluation, and clinicians may be more inclined to diagnose or refer them for evaluation, the researchers note. Nonetheless, the study results support those of research released in a similar study at the European Psychiatric Association 2022 Congress. Those results also showed an association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired neurodevelopment in 6-week-old infants. In an accompanying commentary, Torri D. Metz, MD, with the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City, says the preliminary findings of Perlis and colleagues are ""critically important, yet many questions remain."" ""Essentially all of what we know now about the effects of in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is from children who were exposed to the early and Alpha variants of SARS-CoV-2, as those are the only children now old enough to undergo rigorous neurodevelopmental assessments,"" Metz points out. Ultimately, Metz says it's not surprising that the pandemic and in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection may adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children. Yet, since this type of study only looks at data from the past, it can only show associations, not cause and effect. ""This type of work is intended to be hypothesis-generating, and that goal has been accomplished as these preliminary findings generate numerous additional research questions to explore,"" Metz writes. Among them: Are there genetic predispositions to adverse outcomes? Will we observe different effects depending upon which SARS-CoV-2 variant the mother was infected by, by the severity of her infection, and by trimester of infection? Is it the virus itself or all of the societal changes that occurred during this period, including differences in how those changes were experienced among those with and without SARS-CoV-2? ""Perhaps the most important question is how do we intervene to help mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on young children,"" Metz notes. Studies where the mothers are followed and observed over a period of time are needed ""to validate these findings, tease out some of the nuance, and identify those at highest risk,"" she adds.",0
6,"Parkinson's is the most common, chronic neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting 1% of the global population over seventy years of age. Right now, there is no cure for this disease and the available treatments focus on addressing its symptoms but not its progression.

Although most cases of Parkinson's are sporadic, the inheritable variants of the disease are mainly associated with mutations of the gene that encodes the LRRK2 enzyme. In 2004 an international research team, in which researchers from the Basque Country participated, established the link between one of the mutations in this enzyme and patients diagnosed with the disease.

So the LRRK2 enzyme, which is also known internationally by the name ""dardarina,"" the Basque word that means tremor, has become one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for developing new drugs to combat inheritable Parkinson's. Neurotoxicity, or the pathogenic effects as a whole associated with LRRK2, is mainly due to the fact that pathogenic mutations increase the kinase activity of this enzyme, which has prompted an international race to develop inhibitors. Right now, specific, powerful inhibitors of the kinase activity of LRRK2 do in fact exist. Yet many of them cause undesirable side effects or produce very unclear clinical results.

This research conducted by Iban Ubarretxena, the Ikerbasque researcher and director of the Biofisika Institute (mixed centre of the CSIC-Spanish National Research Council and the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country) at the UPV/EHU's Science Park (Leioa-Erandio Area), together with an international research team, has revealed that AdoCbl, one of the active forms of vitamin B12, acts as an inhibitor of the kinase activity of LRRK2 in cultured cells and brain tissue. It also significantly prevents the neurotoxicity of the LRRK2 variants associated with Parkinson's in cultured cells of primary rodents, as well as in various genetically modified models used to study this disease. The results of the research have been published in the journal Cell Research.

So according to the study, vitamin B12 has turned out to be a new class of modulator of the kinase activity of LRRK2, which, as Iban Ubarretxena pointed out, ""constitutes a huge step forward because it is a neuroprotective vitamin in animal models and has a mechanism unlike that of currently existing inhibitors. So it could be used as a basis to develop new therapies to combat hereditary Parkinson's associated with pathogenic variants of the LRRK2 enzyme.""",0
9,"June 14, 2022 – The Rolling Stones canceled a show in Amsterdam on Monday after lead singer Mick Jagger tested positive for COVID-19.

The band announced the cancellation in a statement, saying Jagger, 78, tested positive “after experiencing symptoms of COVID upon arrival at the stadium,” which is on the outskirts of Amsterdam. No additional details were available about his condition.

“The Rolling Stones are deeply sorry for tonight’s postponement, but the safety of the audience, fellow musicians and the touring crew has to take priority,” the statement said.

Some fans were already in Amsterdam’s Johan Cruijff Arena when the cancelation was announced about an hour and a half before the concert was scheduled to begin, according to Reuters. The show will be rescheduled, and the tickets will be honored for the new date.

“I’m so sorry that we’ve had to postpone the Amsterdam show with such short notice tonight,” Jagger wrote in a Twitter post.

“I have unfortunately just tested positive for COVID,” he wrote. “We aim to reschedule the date ASAP and get back as soon as we can. Thank you all for your patience and understanding.”",0
12,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily kills motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death 2 to 5 years from diagnosis. Currently ALS has no cure. Despite promising early-stage research, the majority of drugs in development for ALS have failed. Now researchers have uncovered a possible explanation. In a study published November 20th in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, researchers show that the brain's machinery for pumping out toxins is ratcheted up in ALS patients and that this machinery also pumps out medicine designed to treat ALS, thereby decreasing the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. The work showed that when these pumps are blocked, the drug becomes more effective at slowing the progression of the disease in mouse models.

""This mechanism that normally protects the brain and the spinal cord from damage via environmental toxins, also treats the therapeutic drug as a threat and pumps that out as well"" says co-senior author Piera Pasinelli, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and Co-Director of the Weinberg Unit for ALS Research at Thomas Jefferson University. ""Blocking the pumps, or transporter proteins, improved how well the ALS drug worked in mice.""

""Drug resistance via these types of cellular drug-pumps is not new,"" says co-senior author Davide Trotti, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and Co-Director of the Weinberg Unit for ALS research at Jefferson. ""In fact, drug companies routinely check novel compounds for interactions with these transporter proteins, but they typically check in healthy animals or individuals."" Because of the investigators' background in pharmacological sciences and ALS research, examining the role of drug transporter proteins made sense. But rather than look at healthy mice, the researcher looked at how these interactions changed in mouse models of the disease over time.

In research published earlier, the group showed that the function of the pumps changed as the disease progressed in mice, with the pumps becoming more active as the symptoms became more severe. ""The ALS brain and spinal cord may be trying to compensate for the disease by generating more of these pumps,"" says Dr. Trotti. But it was unclear whether this increase would really impact treatment.

To address this question, the investigators led by Drs. Pasinelli and Trotti, tested in the mouse model of ALS the only drug approved for ALS treatment and used by patients, riluzole. Earlier work had shown that the drug loses its effectiveness in patients as the disease progresses, and overall the drug only prolongs survival of ALS patients by 3-6 months. The researchers also chose riluzole because they knew it interacted with two pumps, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast-cancer resistant protein (BCRP -- first discovered for its role in drug resistance in breast cancer). These two pumps can be selectively blocked by an experimental compound called elacridar that leaves other pumps in the brain unaffected.

The team treated mice with the combination of the ALS drug (riluzole) and pump-blocker (elacridar) and showed that the combination extended the life span of mice compared with those treated only with riluzole. Importantly, the combination also alleviated some of the symptoms, improving muscle-strength and other measures in mice.

Unlike most experiments in ALS mice, in which drugs are administered before the mice exhibit symptoms of the disease in an attempt to delay onset, Pasinelli and Trotti tested their hypothesis in a model that mirrored what patients actually experience, with treatment beginning when ALS symptoms become apparent. Treating ALS mice with riluzole when symptoms appear actually provides little to no benefit alone, but together with elacridar, showed marked improvements.

""The fact that elacridar is selective may explain why we didn't see obvious side effects: other transporter proteins in the brain were still active and removing toxins. We simply plugged the ones that allowed riluzole to leak out,"" said Pasinelli.

The finding may also explain why ALS drugs that appear to work initially, fail as the disease progresses: as the motor neurons become more damaged, the brain creates more pumps to try to remove the damage, also removing ALS drugs with greater efficiency than before.

""The research paves a way for improving the efficacy of an already ALS approved drug, if the findings hold true in human clinical trials,"" says Dr. Pasinelli. ""But more importantly it also sheds light on a basic pathological mechanism at play in ALS patients that might explain why so many treatments have failed, and suggests a way to re-examine these therapies together with selective pump-inhibitor.""",0
13,"A collection of photos of genetically unrelated lookalikes, along with DNA analysis, revealed that strong facial similarity is associated with shared genetic variants. The work appears August 23 in the journal Cell Reports.

""Our study provides a rare insight into human likeness by showing that people with extreme lookalike faces share common genotypes, whereas they are discordant at the epigenome and microbiome levels,"" says senior author Manel Esteller of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. ""Genomics clusters them together, and the rest sets them apart.""

The number of people identified online as virtual twins or doubles who are genetically unrelated has increased due to the expansion of the World Wide Web and the possibility of exchanging pictures of humans across the planet. In the new study, Esteller and his team set out to characterize, on a molecular level, random human beings that objectively share facial features.

To do so, they recruited human doubles from the photographic work of François Brunelle, a Canadian artist who has been obtaining worldwide pictures of lookalikes since 1999. They obtained headshot pictures of 32 lookalike couples. The researchers determined an objective measure of likeness for the pairs using three different facial recognition algorithms.

In addition, the participants completed a comprehensive biometric and lifestyle questionnaire and provided saliva DNA for multiomics analysis. ""This unique set of samples has allowed us to study how genomics, epigenomics, and microbiomics can contribute to human resemblance,"" Esteller says.

Overall, the results revealed that these individuals share similar genotypes, but differ in their DNA methylation and microbiome landscapes. Half of the lookalike pairs were clustered together by all three algorithms. Genetic analysis revealed that 9 of these 16 pairs clustered together, based on 19,277 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Moreover, physical traits such as weight and height, as well as behavioral traits such as smoking and education, were correlated in lookalike pairs. Taken together, the results suggest that shared genetic variation not only relates to similar physical appearance, but may also influence common habits and behavior.

""We provided a unique insight into the molecular characteristics that potentially influence the construction of the human face,"" Esteller says. ""We suggest that these same determinants correlate with both physical and behavioral attributes that constitute human beings.""

A few study limitations include the small sample size, the use of 2D black-and-white images, and the predominance of European participants. Despite these caveats, the findings may provide a molecular basis for future applications in various fields such as biomedicine, evolution, and forensics.

""These results will have future implications in forensic medicine -- reconstructing the criminal's face from DNA -- and in genetic diagnosis -- the photo of the patient's face will already give you clues as to which genome he or she has,"" Esteller says. ""Through collaborative efforts, the ultimate challenge would be to predict the human face structure based on the individual's multiomics landscape.""

This work was funded by the governments of Catalonia and Spain, as well as the Cellex Foundation.",0
14,"We tend to eat, drink, and move less when we're feeling under the weather. And we're not alone -- most animals reduce those same three behaviors when they're fighting an infection.

Now, a new study pinpoints the cluster of neurons that control these responses, referred to as sickness behaviors. By provoking immune responses in mice, researchers demonstrated that a specific population of cells in the brainstem potently induce three telltale sickness behaviors. In addition, inhibiting these neurons blunts each of these behavioral elements of the sickness response. The findings, published in Nature, directly link inflammation to neural pathways regulating behavior, offering insight into how the immune system interacts with the brain.

""We are still in the early days of trying to understand the brain's role in infection,"" says Jeffrey M. Friedman, Marilyn M. Simpson Professor at The Rockefeller University. ""But with these results, we now have a unique opportunity to ask: What does your brain look like when you're sick?""

Sickness behaviors have been shown to play an important role in an animal's recovery from an infection. Prior studies have bolstered that theory by demonstrating that animals forced to eat when they're sick showed a significantly increased mortality. ""These behavioral changes during infection are really important for survival,"" says lead author Anoj Ilanges, a former graduate student in Friedman's lab, now a group leader at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus

But it has never been clear how the brain coordinates that near-universal urge to refuse meals and curl up under the covers with the onset of infection. So Friedman and Ilanges set out to map the brain regions behind sickness behaviors in mice.

The team began by exposing mice to LPS, a piece of bacterial cell wall that activates the immune system and potently induces sickness behavior. Shortly after an injection of LPS, there was a spike in activity in a brainstem region known as the dorsal vagal complex, among a population of neurons expressing the neuropeptide ADCYAP1. To confirm that they had found the right brain cells, the researchers then activated those neurons in healthy mice and they found that the animals ate, drank, and moved around less. In contrast, when the ADCYAP1 neurons were deactivated , the effect of LPS on these behaviors was significantly reduced.

""We didn't know if the same or different neurons regulated each of these behaviors,"" Friedman says, ""We found it surprising that a single neuronal population appears to regulate each of these components of the sickness response.""

The authors were not, however, altogether surprised that this brainstem region was involved in mediating sickness behaviors. The dorsal vagal complex is one of a precious few physiological crossroads of the central nervous system, where an absence of the blood brain barrier enables circulating factors in the blood to pass information directly to the brain. ""This region has emerged as a kind of alert center for the brain, conveying information about aversive or noxious substances that, more often than not, reduce food intake,"" Friedman says.

In the coming months, Friedman's team at Rockefeller intends to incorporate these findings into their overall goal of understanding the physiological signals and neural circuitry that regulate feeding behavior. They are specifically interested in understanding why even mice engineered to eat voraciously will nonetheless stop eating when exposed to bacterial infections.

Meanwhile, Ilanges plans to investigate what role other brain regions play in response to infections, expanding our knowledge of the brain's role during this critical process. ""We looked at one region of the brain, but there are many others that become activated with the immune response,"" he says. ""This opens the door to asking what the brain is doing, holistically, during infection.""",0
16,"Consuming higher amounts of Vitamin D -- mainly from dietary sources -- may help protect against developing young-onset colorectal cancer or precancerous colon polyps, according to the first study to show such an association.

The study, recently published online in the journal Gastroenterology, by scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and other institutions, could potentially lead to recommendations for higher vitamin D intake as an inexpensive complement to screening tests as a colorectal cancer prevention strategy for adults younger than age 50.

While the overall incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining, cases have been increasing in younger adults -- a worrisome trend that has yet to be explained. The authors of the study, including senior co-authors Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, of Dana-Farber, and Edward Giovannucci, MD, DSc., of the T.H. Chan School, noted that vitamin D intake from food sources such as fish, mushrooms, eggs, and milk has decreased in the past several decades. There is growing evidence of an association between vitamin D and risk of colorectal cancer mortality. However, prior to the current study, no research has examined whether total vitamin D intake is associated with the risk of young-onset colorectal cancer.

""Vitamin D has known activity against colorectal cancer in laboratory studies. Because vitamin D deficiency has been steadily increasing over the past few years, we wondered whether this could be contributing to the rising rates of colorectal cancer in young individuals,"" said Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber. ""We found that total vitamin D intake of 300 IU per day or more -- roughly equivalent to three 8-oz. glasses of milk -- was associated with an approximately 50% lower risk of developing young-onset colorectal cancer.""

The results of the study were obtained by calculating the total vitamin D intake -- both from dietary sources and supplements -- of 94,205 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). This study is a prospective cohort study of nurses aged 25 to 42 years that began in 1989. The women are followed every two years by questionnaires on demographics, diet and lifestyle factors, and medical and other health-related information. The researchers focused on a primary endpoint -- young-onset colorectal cancer, diagnosed before 50 years of age. They also asked on a follow-up questionnaire whether they had had a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy where colorectal polyps (which may be precursors to colorectal cancer) were found.

During the period from 1991 to 2015 the researchers documented 111 cases of young-onset colorectal cancer and 3,317 colorectal polyps. Analysis showed that higher total vitamin D intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. The same link was found between higher vitamin D intake and risk of colon polyps detected before age 50.

The association was stronger for dietary vitamin D -- principally from dairy products -- than from vitamin D supplements. The study authors said that finding could be due to chance or to unknown factors that are not yet understood.

Interestingly, the researchers didn't find a significant association between total vitamin D intake and risk of colorectal cancer diagnosed after age 50. The findings were not able to explain this inconsistency, and the scientists said further research in a larger sample is necessary to determine if the protective effect of vitamin D is actually stronger in young-onset colorectal cancer.

In any case, the investigators concluded that higher total vitamin D intake is associated with decreased risks of young-onset colorectal cancer and precursors (polyps). ""Our results further support that vitamin D may be important in younger adults for health and possibly colorectal cancer prevention,"" said Ng. ""It is critical to understand the risk factors that are associated with young-onset colorectal cancer so that we can make informed recommendations about diet and lifestyle, as well as identify high risk individuals to target for earlier screening.""

The study was funded by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense; by the American Cancer Society Mentored Research Scholar Grant; and by the Project P Fund.

17,"The drink “Proffee” (protein powder mixed with coffee) has been gaining popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, with people claiming it can provide a healthy energy boost and aid with weight loss. Lauren Lee/Stocksy United
• Proffee, a blend of coffee and protein, is a recent TikTok trend causing a stir among experts.
• Some dietitians and nutritionists say there are better ways to add caffeine and protein to your diet.
• Experts also believe there are ways to make proffee healthier but that it’s typically fine in moderation. There’s a new trend brewing on TikTok. It’s called “proffee” and the hashtag #proffee has already received nearly 10 million views on the social media platform. “In the TikTok world, where proffee has taken off, this usually means a protein shake poured over a cold brew or iced coffee, but in actuality, it can be any type of coffee with protein added,” says Carolyn Cohen, an integrative nutritionist, functional medicine health coach, and host of the podcast Wellness While Walking. The dramatic slow-motion videos, which end with a creamy beverage in a glass jar, make it look fun and delicious. And some TikTok users are swearing by its benefits, including weight loss. But do the health claims really shake out? Experts spilled on what you need to know before trying this made-for-social-media beverage.

Some of the most popular purported benefits of proffee swirling around include: But experts offer mixed reviews on these claims. Noah Quezada, RDN, says that proffee can be energizing and improve focus and performance because of the caffeine content. of seven males who underwent a cycling-based exercise test suggested that caffeine increased time to exhaustion by 12 percent. from 2016 of 12 males indicated that moderate caffeine consumption before and during a round of golf improved subjective energy levels and performance while lowering fatigue. That said, it’s important to note that these studies were not done on proffee itself. Dan Gallagher, a registered dietitian with Aegle Nutrition, says there are better ways to get a jolt. “Healthier sources of caffeine would be black or green tea or simply a cup of coffee,” Gallagher says. suggested that protein intake could boost metabolic health and longevity. Patricia Kolesa, MS, RDN of Hackensack Meridian Health notes that the recommended dietary intake is 0.8g/kg of body weight per day. In other words, a 150-pound person would need about 54 grams of protein per day. For context, weighing 174 grams (6.13 oz.) contains about 55 grams of protein. Kolesa says the protein in shakes can contribute to this protein intake but notes that most people can get enough protein from food. And Gallagher says food is a better protein source. “Protein is healthiest when it’s sourced from whole ingredients like seafood, lean beef, beans, eggs, or milk,” Gallagher says. “Maintaining a balanced diet will give all the advertised benefits and more.” Part of the issue is that protein shakes can have added sugars or low quality, processed proteins that don’t measure up to the natural proteins found in foods. “Any health benefits of adding protein to coffee can be quickly undone by the window-dressing — the devil is in the details when it comes to proffee,” Cohen says. Weight loss is one of the most commonly discussed benefits of proffee. Quezada encourages people to proceed with caution. “Proffee is not a miracle weight-loss drink,” Quezada says. That said, Quezada notes that some evidence suggests that caffeine and protein can aid some people in weight management. For example, a of 12 studies indicated that drinking coffee reduced body fat, especially in male participants. suggested it could lower body fat in women. indicated that adhering to a high protein diet could be an effective way to lose weight and prevent obesity. But Kolesa stresses that there are no studies on proffee itself. “It is not a guarantee that the protein coffee itself will help someone lose weight,” she says. And she adds pouring in high fat milk, creamers and sugary syrups can negate any benefits from the beverage’s protein and caffeine.

Ultimately, Quezada stresses that meeting weekly exercise requirements and following a nutritious diet of lean animal and plant-based protein, produce, and complex carbohydrates are more proven ways for individuals to get the benefits of proffee. Kolesa says going this route can help people avoid some cons of drinking proffee, including: The exact number of cups of coffee a person can handle isn’t an exact science — it will vary based on the individual. If you notice you are jittery or having trouble sleeping, consider reducing the amount. But Kolesa says the that most healthy adults can consume 400 mg. of caffeine daily or four to five cups of coffee. However, she says pregnant and lactating people should consume less. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests individuals limit caffeine intake to 200 mg., or one 12-oz. cup of coffee, per day during pregnancy. that a small amount of caffeine passes through breastmilk but says adverse effects, such as poor sleep and irritability, are not typically seen if the lactating person consumes 300 mg. of caffeine, or two to three cups of coffee, daily. The syrups and high fat milk and creamers some TikTokers are putting in their beverages may not be best for people with diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart conditions. “You could try using low sugar syrups or protein shakes/powders,” Kolesa suggests. “You can also try low fat creamers and milk.” An older 2013 study suggested that consuming caffeine six hours before bedtime could disrupt sleep. Kolesa also suggests reading the labels of protein shakes to ensure you are not allergic to any ingredients. Other ingredients may not trigger allergic reactions but could lead to GI issues, like stomach aches. If you notice you’re having those issues, stop using the shake.

Gallagher says proffee isn’t off the table, but it shouldn’t be considered a meal replacement or your primary source of protein or caffeine. “If you’re looking for something tasty, this is probably worth drinking, but I would look at it essentially as a blended drink from Starbucks,” Gallagher says. “It’s probably not something to have daily.” And he stresses it’s essential to rely on advice from healthcare providers and peer-reviewed studies, not TikTokers, for dietary advice. “I would approach nutrition and wellness trends on TikTok with a healthy dose of skepticism,” Gallagher says. “Research, but be wary of what sites are advertising benefits. It’s good to question what biases sites might have, and when in doubt, research scientific studies or medical organizations specifically.”",0
19,"Pregnant women who take extra choline supplements may mitigate the negative impact that viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, can have on their babies, according to a new study from researchers in the Departments of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Choline is a vitamin B nutrient found in various foods and dietary supplements, and is critical to fetal brain development.

""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicts that COVID-19 will impact fetal brain development like other common corona respiratory viruses,"" said Robert Freedman, MD, professor of psychiatry at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus and lead researcher.

The new study, published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, specifically looked at whether higher prenatal choline levels can help protect the fetus's developing brain even if the mother contracts a viral respiratory infection in early pregnancy. The results reveal higher prenatal choline levels mitigate the fetal impact of virus infection.

""It's important for the healthcare community, and soon to be mothers, to be aware that a natural nutrient can be taken during pregnancy, just like folic acid and other prenatal vitamins, to protect fetuses and newborns from brain development issues. Later on in life, these development issues can lead to mental illness,"" Freedman adds.

In the study, researchers analyzed the effects on infant behavior if the mother had contracted a respiratory virus by measuring the infant's IBQ-R Regulation dimension -- which looks at the development of infant attention and other self-regulatory behaviors. Lower IBQ-R Regulation at one year of age is associated with problems in attention and social behavior in later childhood, including decreased reading readiness at age four years and with problems in concentration, and conscientiousness in children through seven years of age.

The results from the study:
• Infants of mothers who had viral infections and higher choline levels had significantly increased 3-month IBQ-R scores on the Regulation dimension and specifically the Attention scale in the Regulation dimension, compared to infants of mothers who had viral infections and had lower choline levels.
• Choline levels sufficient to protect the fetus often require dietary supplements.
• The increased maternal anxiety and depression in the viral-infected mothers were not associated with their infants' IBQ-R Regulation.

The study highlights that in conjunction with the CDC's current advice on COVID-19's effects in pregnancy, phosphatidylcholine or choline supplements along with other prenatal vitamins may help buffer the fetal brain from the possible detrimental impact of the current pandemic and decrease the risk of the children's future mental illness.

""Previous pandemics have resulted in significantly increased levels of mental illnesses including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit disorder in the offspring,"" said Camille Hoffman, MD, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. ""However, since data from COVID-19 itself will not be available for years, we're hoping our study findings will provide valuable information for soon to be mothers on the importance of taking choline supplements daily during pregnancy.""",0
21,"Analysis of individuals with rare, molecularly defined defects in the signaling pathway activated by the hormone insulin (which controls blood glucose levels), by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, has provided new insight that might be applicable to the many individuals with obesity-related resistance to insulin, something that predisposes individuals to type 2 diabetes.

The importance of such studies and the questions that they raise are discussed in an accompanying commentary by Robert Hegele and Karen Reue.

The team, led by Robert Semple and David Savage, found that patients with generalized resistance to insulin because they either carry mutations in the insulin receptor gene or have inhibitory antibodies that bind the insulin receptor, have low levels of fats known as triglycerides in their blood and normal levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL cholesterol).

By contrast, two patients with mutations in the AKT2 gene, which generates a protein that is part of one of the signaling pathways activated when insulin binds the insulin receptor, were found to have increased levels of triglycerides in their blood and low levels of HDL cholesterol.

These and other human data reported here by the authors are consistent with current hypotheses, generated from mouse studies, that abnormal fat and cholesterol levels in individuals with obesity-related resistance to insulin are in fact caused by partial postreceptor liver insulin resistance, i.e., defects in only some signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor on liver cells.",0
24,"May 24, 2022 – The U.S. has begun releasing a monkeypox vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile to protect high-risk people. The two-dose vaccine is approved to prevent smallpox and monkeypox. “I can report that there has been a request for release of the Jynneos vaccine from the National Stockpile for some of the high-risk contacts of some of the early patients, so that is actively happening right now,” Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology at the CDC’s Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Center, said during a news briefing. Approved in the U.S. in 2019, the Jynneos vaccine is meant for use in high-risk adults, according to Reuters. McQuiston said the U.S. has a “good stock” of doses because it has prepared for the possibility of needing the vaccine for smallpox. “Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of that available,” McQuiston said. “We expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us.” ACAM2000 is another smallpox vaccine licensed in the U.S. It could be used to prevent monkeypox as well, and the U.S. has more than 100 million doses. “ACAM2000 is an older-generation smallpox vaccine that has some potential significant side effects with it,” McQuiston said. “So, a decision to use that widely would have to have some serious discussion behind it.” First, federal health officials plan to use a few vaccines among close contacts of the current patients to prevent the virus from spreading, according to CNN. “We are hoping to maximize vaccine distribution to those that we know would benefit from it,” McQuiston said. “Those are people who’ve had contact with known monkeypox patients, health care workers – very close personal contact -- and those in particular who might be at high risk for severe disease.” By the CDC’s count, the first confirmed monkeypox case in the U.S. is a man from Massachusetts who recently traveled to Canada. At least six suspected cases span across the country, according to ABC News, with one in New York, two in Florida, two in Utah and one in Washington. They tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there was also one suspected case of monkeypox under investigation in Sacramento County, CA, local news station KTXL reported. The suspected case was identified in a person who had recently traveled to Europe. Given the current outbreak, health care providers should assume that orthopox cases are monkeypox, McQuiston said. The CDC expects to receive samples from the suspected cases and test them this week. “It is likely that there are going to be additional cases reported in the United States,” she said. On Monday, Seattle health officials announced that a “presumptive” case is being investigated in an adult male who traveled internationally during the past month to a country that had reported monkeypox cases, according to The Associated Press. The initial testing was completed Monday at a state laboratory, the AP reported. Federal health officials will confirm the case. The man wasn’t hospitalized and is isolating at home, Seattle health officials said, noting that they don’t believe there is a high risk to the public. Also on Monday, the CDC issued a travel alert to “practice enhanced precautions” as monkeypox spreads in multiple countries. Cases have now been confirmed in more than 16 countries. “Risk to the general public is low, but you should seek medical care immediately if you develop new, unexplained skin rash (lesions on any part of the body), with or without fever and chills,” the CDC wrote. The World Health Organization announced Tuesday that there have been 131 confirmed cases and 106 additional suspected cases outside of Africa since the first case was reported on May 7, according to Reuters. Although the multi-country outbreak is unusual, it remains “containable” and limited, WHO officials said. International health officials are meeting this week and next week to talk about how to tackle the situation.",0

Presidential Executive Order 11,110 is quite infamous among conspiracy buffs. Jim Marrs, author of Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, writes that the order instructs the Treasury secretary to issue about $4.2 billion in silver certificates as a form of currency in place of Federal Reserve Notes. Written by John F. Kennedy, Marrs also speculates this order was part of a larger plan by Kennedy to reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve by giving the Treasury more power to issue currency. The order was signed June 4, 1963. A few months later, of course, Kennedy was killed, and conspiracy theorists hypothesize a link between the murder and E.O. 11,110. They argue that the Federal Reserve was somehow involved in the assassination to protect its power over monetary policy.
The executive order modifies a pre-existing order issued by Harry Truman in 1951. E.O. 10,289 states ""The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby designated and empowered to perform the following-described functions of the President without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President..."" The order then lists tasks (a) through (h) which the Treasurer can now do without bothering the President. None of the powers assigned to the Treasury in E.O. 10,289 relate to money or to monetary policy. Kennedy's E.O. 11,110 then instructs that.
In summary, E.O. 11,110 did not create new authority to issue additional silver certificates. In fact, its intention was to ease the process for their removal so that small denomination Federal Reserve Notes could replace them in accordance with a law Kennedy himself signed.

30,"The VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) is the largest and most recent to test whether vitamin D or fish oil can effectively prevent cancer or cardiovascular disease. Results to date have been mixed but show promise for some outcomes, now confirmed by updated pooled (meta) analyses. The latest results from VITAL will be presented during The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Annual Meeting in Chicago, September 25-28, 2019.

Nearly 26,000 U.S. men and women participated in the nationwide VITAL clinical trial. After more than five years of study and treatment, the results show promising signals for certain outcomes. For example, while Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) showed only a small, but nonsignificant, reduction in the primary cardiovascular endpoint of major CVD events, they were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks. The greatest treatment benefit was seen in people with dietary fish intake below the cohort median of 1.5 servings per week but not in those whose intake was above that level. In addition, African-Americans appeared to experience the greatest risk reductions. The heart health benefits are now confirmed by recent meta-analyses of omega-3 randomized trials.

Similarly, vitamin D supplementation did not reduce major CVD events or total cancer incidence but was associated with a statistically significant reduction in total cancer mortality among those in the trial at least two years. The effect of vitamin D in reducing cancer death is also confirmed by updated meta-analyses of vitamin D trials to date.

""The pattern of findings suggests a complex balance of benefits and risks for each intervention and points to the need for additional research to determine which individuals may be most likely to derive a net benefit from these supplements,"" says Dr. JoAnn Manson, lead author of the study from Brigham and Women's Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.

""With heart disease and cancer representing the most significant health threats to women, it is imperative that we continue to study the viability of options that prevent these diseases and help women survive them,"" says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, NAMS medical director.",0
32,"The frequency and size of meals was a stronger determinant of weight loss or gain than the time between first and last meal, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.

According to the senior study author Wendy L. Bennett, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, although 'time-restricted eating patterns' -- known as intermittent fasting -- are popular, rigorously designed studies have not yet determined whether limiting the total eating window during the day helps to control weight.

This study evaluated the association between time from the first meal to last meal with weight change. Nearly 550 adults (18 years old or older) from three health systems in Maryland and Pennsylvania with electronic health records were enrolled in the study. Participants had at least one weight and height measurement registered in the two years prior to the study's enrollment period (Feb.-July 2019).

Overall, most participants (80%) reported they were white adults; 12% self-reported as Black adults; and about 3% self-identified as Asian adults. Most participants reported having a college education or higher; the average age was 51 years; and the average body mass index was 30.8, which is considered obese. The average follow-up time for weight recorded in the electronic health record was 6.3 years.

Participants with a higher body mass index at enrollment were more likely to be Black adults, older, have Type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, have a lower education level, exercise less, eat fewer fruits and vegetables, have a longer duration from last mealtime to sleep and a shorter duration from first to last meal, compared to the adults who had a lower body mass index.

The research team created a mobile application, Daily24, for participants to catalog sleeping, eating and wake up time for each 24-hour window in real time. Emails, text messages and in-app notifications encouraged participants to use the app as much as possible during the first month and again during ""power weeks"" -- one week per month for the six-month intervention portion of the study.

Based on the timing of sleeping and eating each day recorded in the mobile app, researchers were able to measure:
• the time from the first meal to the last meal each day;
• the time lapse from waking to first meal; and
• the interval from the last meal to sleep.

They calculated an average for all data from completed days for each participant.
• Meal timing was not associated with weight change during the six-year follow-up period. This includes the interval from first to last meal, from waking up to eating a first meal, from eating the last meal to going to sleep and total sleep duration.
• Total daily number of large meals (estimated at more than 1,000 calories) and medium meals (estimated at 500-1,000 calories) were each associated with increased weight over the six-year follow up, while fewer small meals (estimated at less than 500 calories) was associated with decreasing weight.
• The average time from first to last meal was 11.5 hours; average time from wake up to first meal measured 1.6 hours; average time from last meal to sleep was 4 hours; and average sleep duration was calculated at 7.5 hours.
• The study did not detect an association meal timing and weight change in a population with a wide range of body weight.

As reported by Bennett, even though prior studies have suggested intermittent fasting may improve the body's rhythms and regulate metabolism, this study in a large group with a wide range of body weights did not detect this link. Large-scale, rigorous clinical trials of intermittent fasting on long-term weight change are extremely difficult to conduct; however, even short-term intervention studies may be valuable to help guide future recommendations.

Although the study found that meal frequency and total calorie intake were stronger risk factors for weight change than meal timing, the findings could not prove direct cause and effect, according to lead study author Di Zhao, Ph.D., an associate scientist in the division of cardiovascular and clinical epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Researchers note there are limitations to the study since they did not evaluate the complex interactions of timing and frequency of eating. Additionally, since the study is observational in nature, the authors were unable to conclude cause and effect. Future studies should work toward including a more diverse population, since the majority of the study's participants were well-educated white women in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., the authors noted author.

Researchers also were not able to determine the intentionality of weight loss among study participants prior to their enrollment and could not rule out the additional variable of any preexisting health conditions.

According to the American Heart Association's 2022 statistics, 40% of adults in the U.S. are obese; and the Association's current diet and lifestyle recommendations to reduce cardiovascular disease risk include limiting overall calorie intake, eating healthy foods and increasing physical activity.

The 2017 American Heart Association scientific statement: Meal Timing and Frequency: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention did not offer clear preference for frequent small meals or intermittent fasting. It noted that irregular patterns of total caloric intake appear to be less favorable for the maintenance of body weight and optimal cardiovascular health. And, altering meal frequency may not be useful for decreasing body weight or improving traditional cardiometabolic risk factors.",0
33,"Nov. 14, 2022 -- More than 3 million middle and high school students said they used tobacco products in the last 30 days, the CDC reports. That’s 11.3% of students surveyed. Overall, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle schoolers reported current tobacco use, the CDC said in its Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report. The most commonly used products were e-cigarettes, followed by cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and pipe tobacco. The findings come from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which was conducted January 18, 2022, to May 31, 2022. “Commercial tobacco product use continues to threaten the health of our nation’s youth, and disparities in youth tobacco product use persist,” Deirdre Lawrence Kittner, director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health, said in a statement. “By addressing the factors that lead to youth tobacco product use and helping youth to quit, we can give our nation’s young people the best opportunity to live their healthiest lives.”

Broken down by groups, tobacco products had been used in the last 30 days by 12.3% of female students; 10.3% of males; 13.5% of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives; 12.4% of Whites; 11.5% of Blacks; 11.1% of Hispanics or Latinos; and 3.1% of Asian students. Tobacco use was reported by 16% who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual; 16.6% who identified as transgender; 18.3% who reported severe psychological distress; 12.5% with low family affluence; and 27.2% who reported getting mostly F grades. Favors, marketing, and misperceptions of harm are major factors contributing to youths’ use of tobacco. Most youth who use tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, want to quit, the CDC’s statement said. “Youth use of tobacco products – in any form – is unsafe,” said the report. “Such products contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and can harm the developing adolescent brain. Using nicotine during adolescence might also increase risk for future addiction to other drugs.” The report said the ability to compare the 2022 survey findings to previous years is “limited” because of differences in data collection procedures.",0
34,"A simple and cost-effective urine test could improve early detection and management of bladder cancer, according to a brief issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

37,"Writing in Nature Medicine, an international team headed by researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine describe a new way to effectively deliver a gene-silencing vector to adult amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice, resulting in long-term suppression of the degenerative motor neuron disorder if treatment vector is delivered prior to disease onset, and blockage of disease progression in adult animals if treatment is initiated when symptoms have already appeared.

The findings are published in the December 23, 2019 online issue of the journal Nature Medicine. Martin Marsala, MD, professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, is senior author of the study.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons responsible for communicating movement are specifically harmed, with subsequent, progressive loss of muscle control affecting the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe. More than 5,000 Americans are diagnosed with ALS each year, with an estimated 30,000 persons currently living with the disease. While there are symptomatic treatments for ALS, there is currently no cure. The majority of patients succumb to the disease two to five years after diagnosis.

There are two types of ALS, sporadic and familial. Sporadic is the most common form, accounting for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. It may affect anyone. Familial ALS accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all cases in the United States, and is inherited. Previous studies show that at least 200 mutations of a gene called SOD1 are linked to ALS.

The SOD1 gene normally serves to provide instructions for making an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which is widely used to break down superoxide radicals -- toxic oxygen molecules produced as a byproduct of normal cell processes. Previous research has suggested that SOD1 gene mutations may result in ineffective removal of superoxide radicals or create other toxicities that cause motor neuron cell death, resulting in ALS.

The new approach involves injecting shRNA -- an artificial RNA molecule capable of silencing or turning off a targeted gene -- that is delivered to cells via a harmless adeno-associated virus. In the new research, single injections of the shRNA-carrying virus were placed at two sites in the spinal cord of adult mice expressing an ALS-causing mutation of the SOD1 gene, either just before disease onset or when the animals had begun showing symptoms.

Earlier efforts elsewhere had involved introducing the silencing vector intravenously or into cerebrospinal fluid in early symptomatic mice, but disease progression, while delayed, continued and the mice soon died. In the new study, the single subpial injection (delivered below the pia matter, the delicate innermost membrane enveloping the brain and spinal cord) markedly mitigated neurodegeneration in pre-symptomatic mice, which displayed normal neurological function with no detectable disease onset. The functional effect corresponded with near-complete protection of motor neurons and other cells, including the junctions between neurons and muscle fibers.

In adult mice already displaying ALS-like symptoms, the injection effectively blocked further disease progression and degeneration of motor neurons.

In both approaches, the affected mice lived without negative side effects for the length of the study.

""At present, this therapeutic approach provides the most potent therapy ever demonstrated in mouse models of mutated SOD1 gene-linked ALS,"" said senior author Martin Marsala, MD, professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

""In addition, effective spinal cord delivery of AAV9 vector in adult animals suggests that the use of this new delivery method will likely be effective in treatment of other hereditary forms of ALS or other spinal neurodegenerative disorders that require spinal parenchymal delivery of therapeutic gene(s) or mutated-gene silencing machinery, such as in C9orf72 gene mutation-linked ALS or in some forms of lysosomal storage disease.""

The research team also tested the injection approach in adult pigs, whose spinal cord dimensions are similar to humans, for safety and efficacy. Using an injection device developed for use in adult humans, they found the procedure could be performed reliably and without surgical complications.

Marsala said next steps involve additional safety studies with a large animal model to determine the optimal, safe dosage of treatment vector. ""While no detectable side effects related to treatment were seen in mice more than one year after treatment, the definition of safety in large animal species more similar to humans is a critical step in advancing this treatment approach toward clinical testing.""",0

• Gestational diabetes during pregnancy can cause short-term health issues for the mother as well as the baby.
• Researchers, however, say gestational diabetes can lead to a wide array of long-term cardiovascular health issues.
• Experts say medical profession needs to focus more on these long-term effects.
• They urge people who are pregnant to maintain a nutritious, well-balanced diet as well as a regular exercise routine.

Almost 30 years ago, while pregnant with my second daughter, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

It freaked me out at the time, but through healthy eating and smart interventions, I was able to avoid insulin.

I’ve barely thought of it since. I’m not even sure I always remember to mention it in health surveys.

A study being presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting, The Pregnancy Meeting, suggests I should have been paying more attention, and so too should all women, either before any pregnancy or after one that involved gestational diabetes.

In their study, the researchers say gestational diabetes is associated with an increased risk of more diverse cardiovascular outcomes later in life than previously thought.

Using participants in the UK Biobank, a database containing health information from an estimated half a million participants, researchers looked at the cardiovascular health of nearly 220,000 women who had delivered at least one baby between 2006 and 2010.

Results showed that slightly more than 13,000 women — or 6 percent — developed cardiovascular problems. It also showed that women with a history of gestational diabetes were at greater risk of a variety of cardiovascular problems, and that risk increased with age.

“Until now, the long-term outcome of GDM (gestational diabetes) in the elderly population has not been studied,” Dr. Seung Mi Lee, a specialist in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at the Seoul National University College of Medicine and lead author of the study, told Healthline.

“GDM increased the risk of diverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation in [older] women,” she added.

For practitioners in the field, this data backs up something they’ve been pushing all along: that a GDM diagnosis should be followed through life.

“This does not surprise me or any of my colleagues in any way,” Dr. Tamika Cross, FACOG, the author of “What a Doctor Looks Like,” told Healthline.

“It’s good to have specific data,” she added. “When counseling, we always talk about long term. But it’s vague and general. Now we can be more specific.”

Cross said that many forget the diagnosis as time goes on.

“I think calling it a ‘diabetes of pregnancy’ makes (patients) focus that way,” she said. “There’s a feeling of ‘after I deliver, it goes away.’”

OB-GYNs have long been fighting that.

“As OB-GYNs, we have long known that women with gestational diabetes have a significant risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life,” Dr. David Lubetkin, FACOG, the medical director of Boca Midwifery in Boca Raton, Florida, told Healthline.

“This study puts a quantifiable number on the risk, and shows how important it is to help identify those at risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future, and even identifying those women who [had pre-existing diabetes] prior to pregnancy unbeknownst to them,” he added.",0

48,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0

At the societal level, the argument that the rise in the use of psychiatric drugs has caused a corresponding rise in violence and homicide does not hold water for the simple fact that there has been no corresponding rise in violence and homicide. Just the opposite. Over a twenty-year period, violent crime in general and homicides by youths in particular decreased significantly. Medications cannot be blamed for a crisis of 'mania, murder and mayhem' because there is no such crisis.
The argument at the level of individual shooters is damaged by the frequent errors made by people espousing their views, including inaccurate claims about which shooters took medications, whether they were on medications at the time of their attacks, and the effects the medications actually had on them.
The concern about adverse effects of psychiatric medications is a legitimate concern and worthy of ongoing research. This concern, however, is not well served by assumptions, misinformation, and innuendo in the place of facts.

52,"Aug. 10, 2022 -- Using substitutes for salt can reduce blood pressure and the risk of heart disease, stroke and death from all causes, a new study says.

A diet too high in salt composed of sodium chloride raises blood pressure and damages cardiovascular health, raising the chances of early death.

But the research published in the journal Heart says that we can lower all of these health risks by using a substitute for salt that replaces part of the sodium chloride with potassium chloride.

The survey results were reported in the British Guardian.

Some 32,000 people were involved in 21 clinical trials examining the effects of salt substitutes on blood pressure. Researchers discovered that the salt substitutes lowered blood pressure across the board, regardless of factors such as age, gender and weight.

“Salt substitutes produce consistent blood pressure-lowering effects across geographies and diverse participant subsets,” the researchers write.

There were no ill effects from using more potassium chloride, although it is a concern for people with kidney disease; they should limit how much potassium they ingest every day.",0
53,"Today, the University of Colorado Cancer Center released new research that showcases chemotherapy treatment before and after surgery for pancreatic cancer as the most effective combination for patients.

""It's critical to have large scale data that doctors can use to make decisions about chemotherapy plans for patients who qualify for pancreatic cancer surgery,"" said author Marco Del Chiaro, MD, division chief of surgical oncology at the CU Cancer Center on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

The study showed overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, compared to the group of patients that did not receive it.

This was the case for all patients independent of their lymph node status and resection margins.

""The success of adjuvant chemotherapy used to be unclear, with varied data available for doctors to consider. Our study suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery should be implemented no matter the biological stage of the cancer,"" adds Del Chiaro.

The researchers conducted a nationwide, retrospective study examining the overall survival of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not. To do so, they used data from the National Cancer Database and included nearly 900 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed between 2010 to 2018.

They found adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better survival in patients with any pathological N stage and margin status.

""It's important to continue to move forward research in pancreatic cancer care to improve the survival rate. By conducting the largest study of its kind and analyzing data using multiple models, we're able to improve the knowledge in this paper for doctors and patients to inform their plans and help prolong survival in many cases,"" said lead researcher Sugawara.

Sugawara and his team investigated the interactions between pathological findings and adjuvant chemotherapy in separate multivariable Cox regression models. Their findings suggest that tumors with aggressive biology benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy even after surgery.

The new findings were made possible by the research team at the CU Cancer Center.",0
54,"May 5, 2023 – There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause disruptions in women’s menstrual cycles, according to results from a study of nearly 3 million women in Sweden.

The study was initiated following widespread anecdotal reports from women who said they experienced changes in their cycles following vaccination, such as fewer days between periods or heavier bleeding.

The researchers did observe an increased risk for postmenopausal bleeding after a third vaccine dose.

The authors noted that “menstrual cycles vary naturally and minor menstrual disturbances are generally not considered to be of clinical importance. Changes can, however, generate considerable distress in the affected women, especially during a mass vaccination campaign when concerns are raised about adverse reactions that might not yet be well characterized.”

The Swedish study is the largest examination to date that looked for a relationship between vaccination and menstrual changes, but researchers found no evidence pointing to the shots as the cause.

The findings were included in this week’s edition of the British Medical Association journal called The BMJ. Data were analyzed for women in Sweden ages 12 to 74 years old from December 2020 to February 2022. More than 2.5 million of the 2.9 million women in the study received at least one dose of a Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. More than half of the women received three doses. Drawing on data from primary care or specialist visits and from hospital stays, the researchers evaluated the impact of the vaccines within 1 to 7 days of getting a shot and within 8 to 90 days. They looked for menstrual disturbance such as a change in cycle days, unusual bleeding, and postmenopausal bleeding.

The researchers said they did see “weak and inconsistent associations” between vaccination and health care contacts related to menstrual changes and postmenopausal bleeding, but there were no patterns that were strong enough to conclude that the shots caused the issues.",0
55,"July 27, 2022 – President Joe Biden has tested negative for COVID-19, after testing positive a week ago.

Biden, who has been isolating for the past 5 days, has no fever and his symptoms are “steadily improving,” according to his personal doctor, Kevin O’Connor, DO. The president will resume his normal duties and end his isolation.

The president, 79, says that “unlike his predecessor,” he continued to work from the White House after catching the virus. Former President Donald Trump tested positive in October 2020 and spent several days in the hospital.

Biden is fully vaccinated and has received two booster shots. He has been taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid to aid his recovery.

In a speech in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, Biden touted Paxlovid and its ability to reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death by around 90%.

Due to rare “rebound” COVID-19 cases in people who have taken Paxlovid, the commander-in-chief will test more frequently, and he will wear a mask around other people for the next 10 days, according to O’Connor.",0

• Topical CBD products are often mislabeled, with some products containing levels of CBD that differ from what’s listed on the label.
• Other CBD products may contain THC, the main psychoactive ingredient found in cannabis, despite being labeled ‘THC-free.’
• According to experts, mislabeled ingestible and transdermal CBD products may pose health risks, especially for individuals taking certain medications.
• Knowing how to identify a trustworthy CBD manufacturer can help consumers inform their decisions when purchasing CBD products. CBD (cannabidiol) is often marketed as a cure-all, but most products are unregulated. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has only one CBD product, Epidiolex, for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome. According to a , many topical CBD products available online or at retail stores don’t contain the amount of cannabidiol that’s listed on the label. The research, recently published in Jama Network Open, shows that some CBD products may even contain THC — the main active ingredient found in cannabis that causes a “high” — despite claims of being THC-free. “Misleading labels can result in people using poorly regulated and expensive CBD products instead of FDA-approved products that are established as safe and effective for a given health condition,” Tory Spindle, PhD, co-author of the new study and assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a press release.

CBD and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) are the most commonly known compounds in cannabis. While THC can produce a high, CBD doesn’t. Under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, (the Farm Bill), CBD products that contain less than 0.3% of THC are not considered illegal under federal law. This has led to the proliferation of questionable CBD products that have not been thoroughly tested to ensure they contain what the label claims they do. Still, some THC-containing CBD products disclose on labels that they contain 0.3% or less THC. This may vary depending on whether the CBD product is full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, or CBD isolate. In the new study, researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore tested 105 topical CBD products — including lotions, creams, and patches — purchased online and at retail stores in 2020. Only 85% of the products listed the amount of CBD in milligrams on the label, researchers found. Of products that listed the CBD amount, only about 25% were accurately labeled. By contrast, over half contained more CBD than listed on the label, while almost 20% contained less CBD than listed on the label. Researchers also detected THC in 35% of 105 products, although all were within the legal limit of 0.3%. However, four THC-containing products were still labeled THC-free and 19 didn’t mention THC on the label at all. Earlier research has found similar inaccurate and misleading labeling of CBD products. In a , researchers from the University of Pennsylvania tested 84 CBD liquid extracts purchased online. Around 30% contained the amount of CBD listed on the label. However, more than 40% contained more CBD than listed on the label, and around 25% contained less CBD than listed on the label. In addition, researchers detected THC in more than 20% of the products.

Jamie Corroon, ND, MPH, the founder and medical director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Education in Del Mar, California, said mislabeled CBD products are certainly a problem, but the health risks may depend on the product and how it’s mislabeled. If you use a CBD product that contains more CBD than listed on the label, especially for ingestible products, higher amounts of CBD could enter your bloodstream. Still, it’s unlikely that topical CBD products like lotions or creams, including those containing 0.3% or less of THC, would produce a “high.” According to Corroon, mislabeled topical CBD products that could present a higher risk are transdermal products — similar to nicotine patches — that are designed to move the compounds into the bloodstream through the skin. Of course, the presence of THC in a transdermal or ingestible CBD product presents different risks. For example, a person who ingested a mislabeled CBD product “might be driving a vehicle when the effects [of the THC] hits, and that could cause problems for them,” Corroon said. “It’s also possible that they might fail a drug test.” Indeed, a 2019 study by Johns Hopkins researchers found that the use of CBD products containing less than 0.3% THC may result in a positive result on a urine drug screening test. Experts have expressed concern that the amount of CBD in a product could interact with prescription medications that a person is taking, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, cholesterol medications, and pain medications. Corroon said for accurately-labeled CBD products, the risk of a drug interaction is “pretty small” unless the person consumes an entire bottle of CBD extract or uses a high-potency CBD product. “Nonetheless, the risk exists,” he said. Drug interactions with CBD may occur during the metabolization process. CBD is metabolized in the body by a family of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Within the CYP450 family is an enzyme called CYP3A4, which also metabolizes about 60% of prescription medications. However, CBD can interfere with CYP3A4 and inhibit how a medication is broken down in your system. If your body metabolizes a medication too slowly, it could mean that you end up with more medication in your system than you need, which may lead to unwanted or harmful side effects.

The FDA doesn’t regulate CBD products the way that it does prescription drugs, although the agency will send to companies if they run afoul of the law. This lack of upfront regulation, though, can make it difficult for people to find quality CBD products. One way to choose a high quality CBD product is to ask a healthcare professional you trust for their recommendations. While there’s no standard laboratory testing of CBD products, Corroon said that some companies do go the extra mile to ensure their products meet certain quality standards. Those that do, don’t hide that information, he added. “There are manufacturers out there that are making it easy for you to look at a certificate of analysis, such as linking to it from a QR code on the label,” Corroon said. “This hopefully would be more accurate than the label, especially if the analysis was done by an independent third party.” Another sign that a CBD manufacturer cares about quality is they don’t make health claims about their products — these kinds of claims are not allowed by the FDA for CBD products. According to Corroon, companies that want to stay in the marketplace for the long haul tend to be very mindful of the FDA and other government regulations for CBD products. “If a company is out there making a lot of claims, to me that’s a red flag,” he said. “So any company that’s saying ‘we can treat this’ or ‘we can cure that,’ I would avoid them.”",0
60,"A taste adaptation intervention lowers salt intake and increases enjoyment of a sodium restricted diet in patients with hypertension, according to a small study presented at ACNAP-EuroHeartCare Congress 2022, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).1

""One of the major barriers to sticking to a low salt diet is that people do not like the taste, but few studies have addressed this issue,"" said study author Professor Misook Chung of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, US. ""Our pilot study in patients with high blood pressure shows that it is possible to change taste perception and learn to like food with less salt.""

Hypertension affects more than one billion people worldwide and is the leading global cause of premature death.2 A healthy lifestyle, including salt restriction, is recommended to delay the need for blood pressure lowering drugs or complement their effects. However, the benefits of reduced sodium intake on blood pressure tend to diminish with time, partly due to poor adherence.

The researchers developed the Sodium Watchers Programme -- Hypertension (SWaP-HTN) for gradual taste adaptation to low salt food. This study examined its short-term effects on sodium intake, blood pressure, preference for salty food, and enjoyment of a sodium restricted diet. A total of 29 adults with hypertension were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care in a 2:1 ratio. Participants in the usual care group received routine medical and nursing care for hypertension including advice to follow a sodium restricted diet and take prescribed medications.

The intervention group received 16 weeks of education and follow-up with a study nurse via video call on a tablet. Sessions were held weekly for six weeks, then every two weeks for 10 weeks. The programme was individualised to each patient's barriers and weekly goals and included salt added at the table, salt used during cooking, grocery shopping, and eating in restaurants. Participants received an electronic device that detects salt content to enable them to identify and avoid high salt food.

Professor Chung explained: ""One of the first steps was for patients to realise how much salt they were eating. Using the electronic device they could test the salt content of restaurant meals and ask the chef to reduce or eliminate salt on their next visit. They also used it at home to lower the salt content in their own cooking. Some people automatically added salt at the table before tasting the food so we asked participants to count the number of 'shakes' and set goals for reducing it. Most participants removed the salt shaker from the table within three weeks.""

At baseline and 16 weeks, all participants provided a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake and had their blood pressure measured. In addition, preference for salty food and enjoyment of a salt restricted diet were assessed on a 10-point scale.

The average age of participants was 63 years and 55% were men. Three patients withdrew from the study and the final analysis included 17 and 9 participants in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively. The researchers compared changes from baseline to study completion between groups. The intervention led to a significant reduction in sodium intake and increased enjoyment of a salt restricted diet. There was a trend of decreasing mean systolic blood pressure in the intervention group, from 143.4 to 133.9 mmHg, but it did not reach statistical significance. The intervention did not change preference for salty food.

Professor Chung said: ""In the intervention group, sodium intake dropped by 1,158 mg per day, which was a 30% reduction from baseline, while the control group increased daily intake by 500 mg. Enjoyment of a low salt diet increased in the intervention group, from 4.8 to 6.5 on a 10-point scale, although patients still preferred salty food. It is likely that the intervention did not translate to a statistically significant fall in blood pressure because of the small sample size.""

She concluded: ""Our study indicates that we can retrain our taste buds to enjoy low sodium food and gradually reduce the amount of salt we eat. The gradual taste adaptation programme has the potential to control blood pressure but needs to be tested in a larger trial with longer follow up.""

1The abstract 'A gradual taste adaption intervention reduced dietary sodium intake among adults with hypertension' will be presented during the session 'ePoster session 3'.

62,"University of Helsinki and Taiwanese researchers have found a new way to remove waste from the brain after haemorrhage.

Intracerebral haemorrhage, and bleeding into the brain tissue, is a devastating neurological condition affecting millions of people annually. It has a high mortality rate, while survivors are affected by long-term neurological deficits. No medication has been found to support brain recovery following hemorrhage.

In an international collaboration, researchers from the Brain Repair laboratory, University of Helsinki, together with their Taiwanese colleagues investigated whether a protein called cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) has potential as a treatment for brain hemorrhage.

Researchers suggest that cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor, a protein being currently tested for Parkinson's disease treatment, also has therapeutic effects and enhances immune cell's response after brain haemorrhage.

The authors found that the administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor accelerates hemorrhagic lesion resolution, reduces brain swelling, and improves functional outcomes in an animal model of brain hemorrhage.

""Surprisingly, we found that cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor acts on immune cells in the bleeding brain, by increasing anti-inflammatory mediators and suppressing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that are responsible for cell signalling. This is a significant step towards the treatment of injuries caused by brain haemorrhage, for which we currently have no cure,"" says Professor Mikko Airavaara, from University of Helsinki.

Dr. Vassileios Stratouliasfrom the Brain Repair laboratory comments, ""It's interesting to note that after a bleeding episode, the brain contains a lot of waste and debris. Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor encourages immune cells in the brain to consume and remove the waste and debris, which is essential for the brain's recovery!.""

The administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor also resulted in the alleviation of cell stress in the area that surrounds the hematoma.

Finally, the researchers demonstrated that systemic administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor promotes scavenging by the brain's immune cells after brain haemorrhage and has beneficial effects in an animal model of brain haemorrhage.",0
64,"NIH statement from Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers, Director, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Chronic kidney disease affects more women than men, but most people with this condition don’t know they have it. This World Kidney Day, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health, joins organizations around the world in urging women to take action to prevent kidney disease — for themselves and their loved ones.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent and manage kidney disease and its main causes — diabetes and high blood pressure. One in seven Americans has chronic kidney disease, or CKD, a condition that can lead to kidney failure and means your kidneys are damaged and can’t filter blood the way they should. CKD affects 16 percent of women and 13 percent of men. Approximately 700,000 people in the United States have kidney failure treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Given the impact of kidney disease on women, the NIDDK encourages all women to learn about risk factors and talk with health care professionals. Taking action now can help protect your kidneys. Here are ways to reduce your risk:
• Choose healthier foods, such as fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.
• Be physically active for 30 minutes or more on most days.
• Reduce screen time, and aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.
• Join family, friends, or coworkers in encouraging each other to stick to a healthy routine.
• Use the NIH Body Weight Planner to help achieve and stay at a healthy weight.

NIDDK-funded research continues to examine how lifestyle changes affect kidney disease, diabetes, and more. The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort is an ongoing observational study looking at a wide spectrum of kidney disease topics, such as the risk factors for loss of kidney function and the link between kidney and heart disease. The Sit Less, Interact, Move More Intervention for Sedentary Behavior in Chronic Kidney Disease clinical trial is recruiting participants with CKD to find out whether decreasing time spent sitting and increasing walking time will result in less belly fat and improved physical function and quality of life.

The NIDDK conducts and supports research on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutrition, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases. Spanning the full spectrum of medicine and afflicting people of all ages and ethnic groups, these diseases encompass some of the most common, severe, and disabling conditions affecting Americans.

66,"July 13, 2022 -- Americans could soon have a fourth option for COVID-19 vaccines after the FDA today granted emergency use authorization to a two-shot vaccine from Novavax.

The vaccine is authorized for adults only. Should the CDC follow suit and approve its use, Novavax would join Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson on the U.S. market. A CDC panel of advisors is expected to consider the new entry on July 19.

The Novavax vaccine is only for those who have not yet been vaccinated at all.

“Today’s authorization offers adults in the United States who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine another option that meets the FDA’s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, MD, said in a statement. “COVID-19 vaccines remain the best preventive measure against severe disease caused by COVID-19 and I encourage anyone who is eligible for, but has not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, to consider doing so.”",0
67,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0
74,"NIH study broadens understanding of High Impact Chronic Pain in the U.S.

Researchers have demonstrated that disability is as likely in the chronic pain population as it is in those with kidney failure, emphysema or stroke. This is the reality for 11 million U.S. adults with High Impact Chronic Pain (HICP), a new concept that describes those with pain lasting three months or longer and accompanied by at least one major activity restriction. These findings directly address recommendations suggested in the National Pain Strategy by more accurately characterizing the HICP population to further understanding of chronic pain. This study — conducted by scientists at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health as well as the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle,— was published in the Journal of Pain.

“The multidimensional nature of chronic pain is not reflected in commonly used operational definitions based solely on pain duration, resulting in inordinately high prevalence estimates that limit our ability to effectively address chronic pain on a national level,” said Mark Pitcher, Ph.D., visiting fellow in the Division of Intramural Research at NCCIH and one of the authors of the study.

Among the study’s top findings was the revelation that pain-related disability identifies a substantial portion of the chronic pain population experiencing progressive deterioration in mental and physical health outcomes along with substantially higher health care usage. Together, the HICP population constitutes some 4.8 percent of the U.S. adult population. About 83 percent of people with HICP were unable to work for a living, and one-third had difficulty with self-care activities such as washing themselves and getting dressed.

“By differentiating those with HICP, a condition that is associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and cognitive difficulty, we hope to improve clinical research and practice,” said M. Catherine Bushnell, Ph.D., scientific director in the NCCIH Division of Intramural Research and another author of the study.

The concept of HICP was first proposed by the National Pain Strategy to better identify those with significant levels of life interference. While prior epidemiological surveys have assessed the impact of pain using questions that ask how much pain interferes with life activities, it is likely that individuals with severe pain may have had difficulty distinguishing the increased effort required to carry out important life activities. As such, this study used an alternative approach to untether the pain experience from its impact. Activity limitations and participation restrictions were assessed using general disability questions without reference to pain experience.

“It is crucial that we fully understand how people’s lives are affected by chronic pain. It will help improve care for individuals living with chronic pain and strategically guide our research programs that aim to reduce the burden of pain at the population level,” said Linda Porter, Ph.D., director of the Office of Pain Policy at NINDS. “The findings from this study are a strong step toward these goals.”

The study employed nationally representative data from the 2011 National Health Interview Survey to assess the prevalence, psychosocial characteristics, health status and health care usage of the chronic pain population. The study also determined the degree of contribution made by other chronic health conditions to activity limitations and participation restrictions. Statistical analyses were performed on merged datasets that represented a weighted population size of approximately 220.3 million non-institutionalized adults.

This study ultimately highlights the role of pain-related disability as a key indicator of pain impact. Its findings not only serve to refine clinical research and streamline treatment, they also provide much-needed information to policymakers. As such, the results are relevant to researchers, health care professionals and legislators interested in shaping policy around a global health issue.

75,"Very low-dose Avastin effective for preventing blindness in preterm infants

Babies born prematurely who require treatment to prevent blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) could be treated with a dose of Avastin (bevacizumab) that is a fraction of the dose commonly used for ROP currently. Results from the dose-finding study were published April 23 in JAMA Ophthalmology. The study was conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) and supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Preterm babies are at high risk of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and prone to leaking. If left untreated, vessel growth can lead to scarring and retinal detachment, the main cause of ROP-related vision loss. ROP is one of the leading causes of blindness in children.

Established ROP treatments include laser therapy and cryotherapy. Both interventions work by causing the abnormal blood vessels to stop growing before they can cause scarring and retinal detachment.

Avastin is one of several available drugs that inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth by suppressing the overproduction of a signal protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin in 2004 as a cancer therapy. Since then, ophthalmologists have used it off-label to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in ROP, as well as in other ocular disorders. Results from a clinical trial published in 2011 confirmed the benefit of using Avastin over laser therapy for treating the most severe cases of ROP, which occur in a region of the retina known as posterior zone 1.

“As a faster and easier treatment option, anti-VEGF eye injections were a welcomed alternative to laser therapy for treating severe ROP,” said the new study’s protocol chair, David Wallace, M.D., MPH, chair of ophthalmology at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Laser therapy requires sedating the baby for as long as 90 minutes; an Avastin injection takes much less time and is generally less stressful to the infant.

“But we know that anti-VEGF agents injected into the eye also get into the bloodstream, and doctors worry that inhibiting VEGF systemically could interfere with normal development of brain, lung, bone, and kidney tissues,” he said. Evidence suggests that injections of anti-VEGF in the eye reduce levels of VEGF in the bloodstream.

In this study, Wallace and colleagues in the NEI-funded PEDIG hoped to pinpoint the lowest possible therapeutic dose of Avastin by testing progressively lower doses in 10-14 infants per dose. “We didn’t want to start by testing an ineffective dose and risk a child going blind, so we started with 40% of the dose commonly used for ROP. When a dose was successful, we halved it and then tested that dose. Eventually we cut the dose in half seven times,” he said.

“In the current study, we found that 0.004 mg of Avastin – a dose that’s merely 0.6% of the dose used in the 2011 study of Avastin for ROP – may be the lower limit to be effective for most infants with ROP,” said Wallace. The findings set the stage for a randomized controlled trial comparing long-term effects of low-dose Avastin with laser therapy for treating ROP,” he said.

They plan to follow children over time to compare the long-term effects of each strategy on vision and organ development. Previous studies suggest that babies treated with Avastin versus laser may be less likely to become myopic and require glasses for nearsightedness as they grow older.

The study involved 59 preterm infants with type 1 ROP, the most severe form. Each infant had one eye treated by a single injection containing 0.016 mg, 0.008 mg, 0.004 mg, or 0.002 mg of Avastin. If the other eye required treatment, it received twice the concentration (one dose level higher). By comparison, currently used doses of Avastin for ROP range from 0.25 mg to 0.625 mg.

Treatment was considered a short-term success if ROP improved by day four after therapy, and if there was no recurrence or need for additional treatment within four weeks. Such success was achieved in all eyes treated with the 0.016 mg and 0.008 mg doses, and in 9 of 10 eyes receiving 0.004 mg, but only in 17 of 23 eyes receiving 0.002 mg, resulting in the conclusion that 0.004 mg may be the lowest effective dose.

76,"Higher levels of the stomach-derived hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, predict a greater preference for smaller immediate monetary rewards over larger delayed financial rewards, a new study finds. The study results will be presented at ENDO 2021, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting.

This research presents novel evidence in humans that ghrelin, the so-called ""hunger hormone,"" affects monetary decision making, said co-investigator Franziska Plessow, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston. She said recent research findings in rodents suggested that ghrelin may play a part in impulsive choices and behaviors.

""Our results indicate that ghrelin might play a broader role than previously acknowledged in human reward-related behavior and decision making, such as monetary choices,"" Plessow said. ""This will hopefully inspire future research into its role in food-independent human perception and behavior.""

Ghrelin signals the brain for the need to eat and may modulate brain pathways that control reward processing. Levels of ghrelin fluctuate throughout the day, depending on food intake and individual metabolism.

This study included 84 female participants ages 10 to 22 years: 50 with a low-weight eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa, and 34 healthy control participants. Plessow's research team tested blood levels of total ghrelin before and after a standardized meal that was the same for all participants, who had fasted beforehand. After the meal, participants took a test of hypothetical financial decisions, called the delay discounting task. They were asked to make a series of choices to indicate their preference for a smaller immediate monetary reward or a larger delayed amount of money, for instance, $20 today or $80 in 14 days.

Healthy girls and young women with higher ghrelin levels were more likely to choose the immediate but smaller monetary reward rather than waiting for a larger amount of money, the researchers reported. This preference indicates more impulsive choices, Plessow said.

The relationship between ghrelin level and monetary choices was absent in age-matched participants with a low-weight eating disorder. People with this eating disorder are known to have ghrelin resistance, and Plessow said their finding might be another indicator of a disconnect between ghrelin signaling and behavior in this population.

The study received funding from the National Institutes of Health and a Charles A. King Trust Research Fellowship Award to Plessow. Naila Shiraliyeva, M.D., a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, will present the study findings at the meeting.",0

 Lastly, remember that Benadryl (diphenhydramine) provides no benefit following snakebite. Benadryl is an antihistamine. Histamine is not a major component of snake venom, so antagonizing the effects of histamine accomplishes nothing. It does not ""buy time"" or ""reduce inflammation"" or anything of the sort. All it does is give people a false sense of security and distracts them from the most important thing: getting to the hospital so that someone can determine the need for antivenom, which is the definitive treatment for snake envenomation. The only time Benadryl may be helpful is in the rare case of an allergic reaction to either the venom or the antivenom. And in serious reactions, the drug of choice would be epinephrine, not Benadryl, which helps for hives and itching but not the cardiac or respiratory complications.

On Thursday, he said he had just signed a state budget that includes $50 million for development of the insulin and another $50 million for a place to make it.

""Nothing, nothing epitomizes market failures more than the cost of insulin,"" Newsom said in a video posted on the governor's Twitter page. He noted that many Americans have out-of-pocket costs ranging from $300 to $500 per month for insulin, which is used to treat diabetes.

85,"Identifying the dynamic events occurring during urinary tract infections (UTI) has revealed a new potential strategy to combat this condition, considered the most common type of infection. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Washington University School of Medicine have discovered that the sequence of events taking place during UTI sustains a delicate balance between the responses directed at eliminating the bacteria and those minimizing tissue damage that may occur in the process.

The NRF2 pathway stood out as a key contributor to this balance, by regulating both the potential damage to tissues and the elimination of bacteria. Treating an animal model of UTI with the FDA-approved, anti-inflammatory drug dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a known NRF2 activator, reduced tissue damage and bacterial burden, opening the possibility that DMF could be used to manage this condition in the future. The study appears in the journal Cell Reports.

""Urinary tract infections are not only common, but typically recurrent and tend to give rise to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a serious medical concern,"" said corresponding author Dr. Indira Mysorekar, E. L. Wagner Endowed Professor of Medicine- infectious diseases at Baylor, previously at Washington University School of Medicine.

""More than 85% of UTI are caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), bacteria that can attach to the surface of the epithelial cells lining the inside of the bladder, called urothelial cells,"" said first author Dr. Chetanchandra S. Joshi, a postdoctoral associate in the Mysorekar lab. ""Attached UPEC can then enter the urothelial cells, where they reproduce. In the current study, we looked at how urothelial cells fight back UPEC invasion and proliferation while preserving their integrity, which is essential for proper bladder function.""

Working with urothelial cells grown in the lab, Mysorekar, Joshi and their colleagues discovered that a precise sequence of events followed UPEC invasion of urothelial cells. First, in the early hours after their infection, urothelial cells defended themselves by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly active compounds that kill bacteria. However, if sustained, ROS also can damage urothelial cells, which would be detrimental for the bladder.

""We found that accumulation of ROS activated an anti-ROS response in urothelial cells, called the NRF2 pathway, that minimized the damage excess ROS could cause to the urothelial cells,"" Joshi said.

The NRF2 protein is located in the cytoplasm of the cells bound to another protein called KEAP1. ""When ROS reaches a certain level, NRF2 separates from KEAP1 and goes into the nucleus of the cell, where it activates a series of genes. Some of these genes produce proteins that block ROS, and some that limit inflammation,"" Joshi said.

""Interestingly, one of the genes NRF2 activates is Rab27b, which promotes the elimination of UPEC from urothelial cells,"" Joshi said. ""Together, these coordinated events mediate the elimination of UPEC while preserving the integrity of the cells attacked by the bacteria.""

A potential new way to combat UPEC

Understanding the process that follows a UPEC infection revealed a potential new strategy to combat the condition. ""We learned that active NRF2 was involved in both neutralizing ROS, which helped protect urothelial cells, and eliminating UPEC,"" Joshi said. ""These findings suggested that a drug that activated NRF2, such as DMF, might help clear UPEC infections.""

DMF is FDA-approved to treat inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis by dampening the inflammatory response.

""Working with an animal model of UTI, we showed that treatment with DMF activated NRF2, dampened the immune response, limited the level of damage the bacteria caused to urothelial cells, and promoted activation of RAB27B, which removed bacteria from the bladder,"" Mysorekar said. ""Our findings support further exploration of this approach as a potential treatment for UTI.""

Women tend to have recurrent UTI, which can lead to chronic inflammation, extensive bladder mucosal damage and chronic infection. Continued antibiotic treatment also negatively affects the microbiome, the 'good bacteria' of the body, and promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

""The most exciting part about this work was identifying a non-antibiotic-based therapy that contained the infection and reduced inflammation,"" said Mysorekar, who also is professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor. ""Although much work is needed before it reaches the clinic, treatment with DMF has the potential of helping millions of women affected by this condition.""

86,"THURSDAY, April 6, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- Sleep problems — from snoring to sleeping too much or too little — may be associated with elevated stroke risk, researchers say. Snorting during sleep, having poor quality of sleep and sleep apnea may also be linked with greater risk of stroke, according to study findings published online April 5 in the journal Neurology. “Not only do our results suggest that individual sleep problems may increase a person’s risk of stroke, but having more than five of these symptoms may lead to five times the risk of stroke compared to those who do not have any sleep problems,” said study author Dr. Christine McCarthy, of University of Galway in Ireland. “Our results suggest that sleep problems should be an area of focus for stroke prevention,” McCarthy said in a journal news release. For the study, the researchers looked at nearly 4,500 people, including more than 2,200 stroke survivors. They were matched with more than 2,200 people who did not have a stroke.

Participants were an average age of 62. They were asked about their sleep behaviors, including napping and breathing problems during sleep. A total of 162 of those who had a stroke got less than five hours of nightly sleep, compared to 43 of those who did not have a stroke. Those with less than five hours of sleep were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who got an average seven hours of sleep, the investigators found. Another 151 stroke survivors got more than nine hours of sleep a night, compared to 84 of those who did not have a stroke. The long sleepers were twice as likely to have a stroke as those who got seven hours of sleep. In addition, people who took naps longer than one hour were 88% more likely to have a stroke than those who did not, the study found. The researchers also reported that people who snore during sleep are 91% more likely to have a stroke than those who do not. Those who snort are nearly three times more likely to have a stroke than those who do not. Participants with sleep apnea are nearly three times more likely to have a stroke than those without breathing disruptions during sleep.",0

Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccination is rare. TTS is a rare but serious adverse event that causes blood clots in large blood vessels and low platelets (blood cells that help form clots). As of February 3, 2022, more than 18.2 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the United States. CDC and FDA identified 57 confirmed reports of people who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and later developed TTS.CDC has also identified nine deaths that have been caused by or were directly attributed to TTS following J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. Women ages 30-49 years, especially, should be aware of the increased risk of this rare adverse event. There are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen.
-- To date, three confirmed cases of TTS following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna) have been reported to VAERS after more than 522 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered in the United States. Based on available data, there is not an increased risk for TTS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

92,"A team of researchers says it has linked sensitivity to an allergen in red meat to the buildup of plaque in the arteries of the heart. While high saturated fat levels in red meat have long been known to contribute to heart disease for people in general, the new finding suggests that a subgroup of the population may be at heightened risk for a different reason -- a food allergen. The study, which is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, appears in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (ATVB), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.

""This novel finding from a small group of subjects from Virginia raises the intriguing possibility that allergy to red meat may be an underrecognized factor in heart disease,"" said study leader Coleen McNamara, M.D., a professor of medicine in the Cardiovascular Research Center of the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville. ""These preliminary findings underscore the need for further clinical studies in larger populations from diverse geographic regions and additional laboratory work.""

The number of people with red meat allergies in the United States is unclear, but researchers estimate that it may be 1 percent of the population in some areas. The number of people who develop blood antibodies to the red meat allergen without having full-blown symptoms is much higher -- as much as 20 percent of the population in some areas, the researchers say.

Only in recent years did scientists identify the main allergen in red meat, called galactose-α-1,3-galactose, or alpha-Gal, a type of complex sugar. They also found that a tick -- the Lone Star tick -- sensitizes people to this allergen when it bites them. That is why red meat allergies tend to be more common where these ticks are more prevalent, such as the Southeastern United States, but also extending to other areas, including Long Island, New York.

Researchers have suspected for some time that allergens can trigger certain immunological changes that might be associated with plaque buildup and artery blockages, but no one had identified a specific substance that is responsible for this effect. In the current study, researchers showed for the first time that a specific blood marker for red meat allergy was associated with higher levels of arterial plaque, or fatty deposits on the inner lining of the arteries. The blood marker they identified is a type of antibody (immunoglobulin or IgE) that is specific to the alpha-Gal allergen.

To identify this blood marker, the researchers analyzed blood samples from 118 adults and detected antibodies to alpha-Gal, indicating sensitivity to red meat, in 26 percent of them. Using an imaging procedure, the researchers found that the quantity of plaque was 30 percent higher in the alpha-Gal sensitized patients than in the non-sensitized patients. These plaques, a hallmark of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), also tended to be more structurally unstable, which means that they have an increased likelihood of causing heart attack and stroke.

The evidence for a link between red meat allergens and coronary artery disease is still preliminary, the researchers noted, so they plan to conduct detailed animal and human studies to confirm their initial findings. Currently, the only treatment for red meat allergy once it is diagnosed is strict avoidance of red meat.

""While more studies are needed, the current work provides a potential new approach or target for preventing or treating heart disease in a subgroup of people who are sensitized to red meat,"" said Ahmed Hasan, M.D., Ph.D., a medical officer and program director in NHLBI's Atherothrombosis & Coronary Artery Disease Branch.

For now, consumers are encouraged to follow current recommendations for a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes adapting a healthy diet, such as eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other heart-healthy foods. Lean red meats can be part of a heart-healthy diet for those who are not allergic. Other heart-healthy lifestyle changes also include aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, getting more exercise, and quitting smoking.

In addition to funding from NHLBI, this study was also funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). NIH funding support includes the following grants: (KO8-AI085190, K23-HL093118, RO1-AI 20565, PO1-HL55798, RO1-HL136098-01, RO1-HL107490)",0
93,"A gene target for drug resistance, a triple-drug cocktail for triple negative breast cancer, and patients' risk for carpal tunnel syndrome are among study highlights scheduled to be presented by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center scientists during the 33rd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, held Dec. 8-12.

Working with cell cultures and mouse models, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center have tested a cocktail of three drugs that holds promise for treating so-called triple negative breast cancers.

Women with such cancers lack all three hormone receptors -- estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). Currently, treatments for triple negative breast cancers are limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, which provide some improvements but overall poor prognoses.

In the new study, Johns Hopkins scientists began with a drug called Entinostat, which blocks an enzyme that unfolds DNA, providing regulatory molecules access to genes within and also reactivates a gene called retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARβ). Then, they added a drug called All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), related to Vitamin A, which binds a protein made by the reactivated RARβ gene. Together, the ATRA drug and RARβ gene act as a brake on cancer cell growth. The scientists completed the drug cocktail with conventional chemotherapy using either low doses of doxorubicin or paclitaxel.

According to the scientists, each of the three drugs used alone may have some effect on killing tumors cells, but combining them tips the scale in favor of killing more cells.

Tests on laboratory-cultured cells showed that the triple combo therapy halted the growth of multiple triple negative breast cancer cell lines more effectively than any one of the treatments alone. The combined therapy also rejuvenated the expression of RARβ, and strongly inhibited tumor growth in three-quarters of mice engrafted with breast tumor cells.

The researchers are discussing potential clinical trials of the combo therapy, which they hope to start in the next year, says Nguyen K. Nguyen, a graduate student in the Cellular and Molecular Medicine Program at Johns Hopkins.",0
94,"A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.

The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.

The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.

Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.

The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.

Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.

“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

99,"DNA from uterine cells of women with endometriosis has different chemical modifications, compared to the DNA of women who do not have the condition, according to researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health. The changes involve DNA methylation — the binding of compounds known as methyl groups to DNA — which can alter gene activity. Moreover, the methylated DNA regions varied according to the stage, or severity, of endometriosis and responded differently to hormones involved in the menstrual cycle. Uterine responses to hormones influence pregnancy and other functions of uterine tissue.

The study was conducted by Linda C. Giudice, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco. It appears in PLOS Genetics. The study was funded by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

“The findings raise the possibility that differences in methylation patterns could one day be used to diagnose endometriosis and develop customized treatment plans for patients,” said Stuart B. Moss, Ph.D., of NICHD’s Fertility and Infertility Branch.

Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other places in the body, such as on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the bowels and bladder. It affects from 5 to 10% of women in the United States. Its main symptoms include pain, especially during menstrual periods, and infertility. Endometriosis is classified into four stages, ranging from minimal (stage I) to severe (stage IV). The only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is with a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy.

The researchers analyzed a type of cell known as an endometrial stromal fibroblast, which regulates cells in the lining of the uterus. They compared methylation across DNA regions and differences in gene functioning in cells from women who did not have endometriosis or any other gynecological disorders to those of women with stage I endometriosis and of women with stage IV endometriosis. They also observed methylation patterns and gene functioning after the cells were exposed to estradiol (a form of estrogen) alone, progesterone alone, and to a combination of the two hormones to mimic changes in the levels of these hormones that occur during the menstrual cycle.

DNA methylation patterns and gene functioning differed among all groups of cells before exposure to the hormones, with exposure to each individual hormone, and to the combination of the two. The differences in methylation and gene functioning between stage I and stage IV endometrial cells could mean that the two may be distinct subtypes of endometriosis, rather than different degrees of the condition, Dr. Giudice added.

“The data indicate that the proper interactions of hormones and DNA methylation are critical in normal uterine function,” said the study’s lead author, Sahar Houshdaran, Ph.D., University of California, San Francisco. “The changes in these interactions that we’ve seen could play a role in the infertility that often accompanies endometriosis.”

101,"Dec 15, 2022 – Some people with type 2 diabetes may be able to lose weight, lower their blood sugar, and stop taking diabetes drugs, if they follow anintermittent fasting diet for 3 months, new research suggests.

Intermittent fasting – such as the 5:2 diet, which consists of eating few calories for 2 days followed by eating normally for 5 days – has led to weight loss in previous studies.

But it hasn’t been clear whether intermittent fasting might lower HbA1c levels – a measure of a person's average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months.

And specifically, it was not known if intermittent fasting could let people revert to a non-diabetic state, known as diabetes remission – defined as having a blood sugar level below 6.5% for at least 3 months after stopping all diabetes medications.

This new study in 72 patients with type 2 diabetes in China showed that indeed, the 36 patients in the intermittent fasting group lost roughly 13 pounds and maintained this weight loss for 1 year, and close to half achieved diabetes remission. This compared with barely any weight loss for the 36 patients in the control group, of whom just 3% achieved remission.",0

23,"Researchers at Turku University and Åbo Akademi University in Finland have found that cellular extensions called filopodia help build a barrier around breast tumours by preserving the basement membrane surrounding the tumour and blocking their escape. This is surprising as it was previously thought that these cancer cells used their sticky fingers only to invade nearby tissues. The sticky fingers are generated by Myosin-10 and cancer cells lacking Myosin-10 have a weaker basement membrane, making it easier for them to escape and spread. The researchers had previously focused on developing anti-filopodia strategies, but now they emphasize that targeting filopodia or Myosin-10 too early could make things worse. The InFLAMES Flagship is not a joint initiative of the universities and is focused on integrating immunological and immunology-related research activities to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalized medicine, but it is not funded by the Academy of Finland.",1
25,"Tumors contain various types of cells, including cancerous and benign cells. While the simplicity of cells in brain tumors may make treatment easier, the cells are not static and can change. Oncostreams, which are elongated, spindle-like cells found in tumors, determine the behavior of cancerous cells and how tumors grow and invade normal tissue. Brain tumors have a low survival rate, with recurrence being a major cause of death. Collagen 1, a protein produced by tumor cells, is necessary for oncostreams to form and function. Removing Collagen 1 production from tumor cells reduces tumor aggressiveness by removing oncostreams. This discovery could be applied to other types of cancer. The research team used artificial intelligence methods to identify oncostreams in tissue samples. The preservation of oncostreams by maintaining Collagen 1 production could be a potential therapeutic target for brain glioma treatment. Further research on the extracellular matrix is still needed.",1
26,"A recent study published in Radiology indicates that individuals with a history of allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast media used in X-ray-based procedures, such as CT and angiography, may have similar reactions to commonly used MRI contrast agents. The study found that premedication or switching to a different MRI contrast agent may reduce the risk for those with previous contrast agent reactions. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) do not improve visualization or accuracy of diagnosis in MRI. Recent studies have reported adverse reactions, including allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. Dr. Hye-Ryun Kang and colleagues analyzed over 330,000 cases of GBCA exposure in 154,539 patients over an eight-year period at the Seoul National University Hospital. There were no cases of allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. For patients with a history of previous GBCE reactions, the average recurrence rate was 15%. Acute allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions accounted for 1,178 cases, while 126 were delayed allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions, mainly occurring within one week of exposure. Patients with a history of similar reactions to iodinated contrast media were not found to have a higher risk of allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs. Premedication and changing the GBCA showed preventive effects in patients with a history of acute allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. Only premedication significantly reduced the incidence of reactions in patients with a history of delayed reactions. Dr. Kang advises that appropriate premedication strategies be discussed with patients before MRI procedures. The researchers hope to conduct future studies with larger populations to identify possible risk factors and effective preventive strategies for delayed hypersensitivity reactions to GBCA.",1

Women who used cannabis before pregnancy were not found to be less likely to conceive. The authors suggest that women trying to conceive should be cautious with cannabis use until more conclusive evidence is available. The study did not include urine samples from participants. The researchers found that cannabis users were 41% less likely to conceive each monthly cycle than non-users. However, a larger proportion of cannabis users than non-users became pregnant during the study. Differences in miscarriage rates were observed between users and non-users who had achieved pregnancy. Cannabis users had lower levels of luteinizing hormone, but this is unlikely to have influenced their likelihood of conception. The authors caution that until more information is available, women trying to become pregnant should be aware that cannabis could potentially affect their pregnancy chances.

65,"Recent research conducted outside of the NIH Clinical Center found that neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a highly effective biomarker for diagnosing and predicting traumatic brain injury (TBI) when compared to other blood proteins. NfL is better than other proteins at identifying patients with mild, moderate, and severe TBI and is the only protein that showed a correlation with functional outcomes. However, NfL is not the only protein that can distinguish TBI patients from uninjured controls. Additionally, a single TBI does not cause long-term neuroaxonal degeneration, which cannot be detected by measuring serum NfL. This suggests NfL can provide an easier, faster, and more cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic option than advanced brain imaging. The lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., notes that there is currently no validated biomarker that can reliably detect subtle signs of brain injury months to years after a TBI.

The study builds on previous NIH-funded studies that found associations between elevated blood glucose during pregnancy and the development of type 2 diabetes in the future. Those who disagree state that the data collected from this study will not be helpful in determining timing and approach for future clinical trials and that treatment will not affect the children's health years later.
