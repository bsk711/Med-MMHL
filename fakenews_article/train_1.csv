1,"The development of effective anti-androgen therapies for prostate cancer is a major scientific advance. However, some men who receive these targeted treatments are more likely to develop a deadly treatment-resistant prostate cancer subtype called neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). No effective treatment for NEPC exists.

Now, scientists from Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP) have identified how prostate cancer transforms into aggressive NEPC following treatment with anti-androgen therapy. Their findings -- which include the metabolic rewiring and the epigenetic alteration that drives this switch -- reveal that an FDA-approved drug holds potential as a NEPC treatment. The research also uncovers new therapeutic avenues that could prevent this transformation from occurring. The study was published in Cancer Cell.

""Acquired treatment resistance is a major concern for every oncologist. Eventually, over enough time, cancer patients who receive a targeted therapy can become resistant to treatment,"" says Darren Sigal, M.D., an oncologist at Scripps Clinic and Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center who worked with the scientists on the study. ""This study is an important advance that helps us understand why targeted treatments for prostate cancer may promote the development of a more aggressive tumor. These insights could lead to better treatments that help fathers, sons and grandfathers around the world who are fighting prostate cancer.""

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death for American men, according to the American Cancer Society. The cancer grows in response to hormones called androgens. Targeted therapies that block these hormones have extended survival for many patients. However, nearly all men eventually develop resistance to these treatments. In 2019, more than 30,000 men in the U.S. are expected to die from prostate cancer.

""Similar to bacteria that gain resistance to antibiotics, tumors can become resistant to anti-cancer drugs by 'remodeling' their environment and developing strategies to evade targeted therapies. As targeted therapies become more potent, putting more stress on tumors, we expect to see drug resistance become more common,"" says Maria Diaz-Meco, Ph.D., the senior author of the paper and a professor in the Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Networks Program at SBP. ""Our study shows that in a form of treatment-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor suppressor gene called protein kinase C lambda/iota is downregulated. We subsequently identified metabolic and epigenetic vulnerabilities which are possible routes to prevent treatment resistance from arising.""

In the study, the scientists analyzed tissue samples from men with metastatic NEPC, prostate cancer cell lines and a new mouse model of NEPC, created by the researchers, to identify the molecular switch that triggers prostate cancer to become treatment-resistant NEPC following targeted treatment. In addition to detecting the downregulation of protein kinase C lambda/iota, the scientists found that the NEPC cells upregulate the synthesis of a metabolite called serine. Because serine is a non-essential amino acid, treatments aimed at blocking serine production may be devised that could impact the tumor with minimal or no effect on the normal cells, thereby reducing potential toxicities. Additionally, the researchers discovered that the cancer cells used a communication pathway called mTORC1/ATF4 to accelerate the synthesis of serine, allowing the tumor to grow faster and to epigenetically switch to the NEPC mode. A protein that regulates the positions of lysosomes, the cell's degradation machinery, was also involved in the tumor's transformation. Together, these tumor characteristics represent novel approaches that could prevent prostate cancer from transforming into NEPC.

""NEPC is essentially a new cancer. From what it 'eats' to how it looks, the tumor cells are completely reprogrammed. The tumor even loses the receptor that is targeted by current treatments, which is why it is so difficult to treat,"" says Jorge Moscat, Ph.D., a study author and director and professor in SBP's Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Networks Program. ""Identifying the switch that drives the transformation from prostate cancer to NEPC is a critical first step toward developing treatments that prevent treatment resistance in men with prostate cancer before it begins.""

The scientists also identified epigenetic patterns -- molecular tags that modify our DNA -- associated with NEPC, linked to the expression of an enzyme, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which could be a treatment target for NEPC. Next, the scientists plan to work with SBP's drug discovery center, the Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics (Prebys Center), to try to identify a drug that can block PHGDH. The findings also indicated that an FDA-approved drug that inhibits epigenetic changes, called decitabine, could hold promise as a treatment for NEPC.

""Luckily, prostate cancer is a cancer type that is well characterized, which helps us better understand the mechanisms behind treatment resistance,"" says Diaz-Meco. ""With more research, one day we hope that no man dies of prostate cancer.""",0

This presentation is particularly unfortunate because it is just a series of conjectures embedded in a cursory overview of some CDC data.
The main argument seems to be that deaths that would normally have been attributed to some other cause have been attributed to COVID-19 instead. It's too bad the presenter didn't do some actual research to answer the question prior to giving the presentation.

3,"Oct. 7, 2022 – Moms who consume ultra-processed food during pregnancy may contribute to their children being obese or overweight in childhood and adolescence, a new study suggests. Among the 19,958 mother-child pairs studied, 12.4% of children developed obesity or overweight in the full study group, and the children of those mothers who ate the most ultra-processed foods (12.1 servings/day) had a 26% higher risk of obesity/overweight, compared with those with the lowest consumption (3.4 servings/day), reports Andrew T. Chan, MD, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and colleagues. The results were published online in the journal BMJ. The study shows the potential benefits of limiting ultra-processed food during reproductive years to decrease the risk of childhood obesity, the study authors note. Ultra-processed foods, such as packaged baked goods and snacks, fizzy drinks, and sugary cereals, which are linked to an increase in adult weight, are frequently included in modern Western diets. But the relationship between parents eating highly processed meals and their children's weight is unclear across generations, the researchers note. “Overall awareness of the importance of diet in one’s personal health, as well as in the health of their families, is something that we hope will be a source of change, and certainly does start with promoting and educating people about the importance of diet during those critical periods,” Chan said in an interview. He said it is important not to blame mothers for their kids’ health, as there are other things at play beyond just education. “It requires a concerted effort to ensure that we break down the social and economic barriers to access to healthy foods so that it becomes actually feasible for many women to be able to have access to a diet that will promote health for both themselves and their kids.” In this study, investigators looked at whether eating ultra-processed food throughout pregnancy and while raising kids increased the likelihood of children and teens being overweight or obese.

The study team evaluated 14,553 mothers and their 19,958 children using data collected from two large studies. Males comprised 45% of the children in the cohort. The children spanned from 7 to 17 years of age. Childhood obesity or overweight has been linked to maternal consumption of highly processed meals during child-rearing. “We know that lifestyle during pregnancy is important for not only the health of the baby, but also the health of the mother. So, it does represent an opportunity for people to think critically about what they can do to really optimize their health, and it becomes a period of time where people are maybe thinking a little bit more about their health and are more open to new dietary counseling and also more motivated to effect change,” Chan says. It's important for women to consider their diet, Chan says. Women need to take into account “what kinds of foods they are eating and, if possible, try to avoid ultra-processed foods that have very refined ingredients and a lot of additives and preservatives, because they tend to really have a higher content of those dietary factors that we think lead to overweight and obesity,” he says. Physical activity is also important during the reproductive years and pregnancy, and people should aim to sustain physical activity during pregnancy and beyond, Chan notes. The findings may be limited, as they were based on self-reported questionnaires and some mother-children pairs stopped taking part in the study during follow-up. Most of the mothers were from similar personal and family educational backgrounds, had comparable social and economic backgrounds, and were primarily white, which limits how this study can apply to other groups of people, the researchers noted. “Staying healthy isn't something that you should really start doing in middle age or late adulthood, it is really something that should be promoted at a young age, and certainly during young adulthood, because of the influence that it has on your long-term health, but also the potential influence it might have on your family’s,” Chan says.",0
4,"Why do some people with cold sores around their lips experience painful lesions, while others have no symptoms at all, yet still spread the virus? A new study conducted at Penn State finds that these differences could be due to variations in the way certain strains of herpes simplex (HSV-1) -- the virus that causes cold sores, as well as genital herpes -- activate gene expression in neurons.

""HSV-1 occurs in more than half the global population,"" said Moriah Szpara, associate professor of biology and biochemistry and molecular biology. ""Not only does it cause recurrent problems, such as cold sores and genital herpes, but recent research has implicated chronic HSV-1 infection with the development of disease later in life, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.""

Szpara explained that the HSV-1 lifecycle begins upon contact with mucosal surfaces, where it invades skin cells, replicates, and can induce local lesion formation. The virus also enters local nerve endings in the skin, and transits into neurons in the nervous system. There the virus can lie dormant until it reactivates on future occasions. Neuronal damage and host immune responses triggered by viral reactivations are thought to contribute to long-term neurodegeneration.

""Since every person carries a subtly different version of HSV-1, this might explain some of the variation in human responses to infection; for example, why people have different triggers for their outbreaks or why some people experience more painful sores. Differences in the frequency of viral outbreaks, or in virus-induced gene expression patterns, might also affect the different rates at which people with chronic infections go on to develop neurodegenerative diseases.""

To investigate the causes of this variation in responses, Szpara and her colleagues infected human neuronal cells with one of three HSV-1 strains that are known to differ in their ability to cause disease in the nervous system. Next, they used deep sequencing to identify and quantify the transcriptomes -- the entire set of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) made in a cell at any given time -- of the neurons during infection by HSV-1.

According to Szpara, when a neuronal cell is infected with HSV-1, the resulting transcriptome includes the whole collection of mRNAs produced by both the human neuron and the HSV-1 virus. By looking at the timing and amount of mRNAs expressed during infection, scientists can gain insights on the proteins that will soon be produced from those mRNAs. It is the viral proteins and new viral progeny produced during infection that ultimately lead to health problems.

""By simultaneously examining both the viral and neuronal transcriptomes in the infected cells we were able to observe the interplay between the timing of viral mRNA production and protein production, and the ensuing host responses,"" said Szpara.

The scientists used two additional techniques -- immunofluorescence staining of neurons and Western blotting for viral protein levels -- to observe the outcomes of viral and host gene expression. They also used scanning electron microscopy to directly observe changes in neuronal morphology during infection.

Their findings appeared online in PLOS Pathogens on March 22.

The researchers found that different genetic variants of HSV-1 induce different patterns of gene expression in human neuronal cells. Specifically, they found that the viral variants expressed their genes at different rates and quantities, which likely contributes to the different timing and severity of symptoms within hosts. For example, they discovered that one of the variants, which exhibits lower virulence in animal models, displays a different and seemingly delayed pace of viral and host gene expression in neurons. In another example, they found that one variant caused greater changes in expression of genes involved in cell adhesion (or ability of cells to attach to each other), which could impact cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1.

The team also found that these different patterns of gene expression were dependent on the whether the infected cell was a neuron or a skin cell type.

""Together, these data demonstrate the importance of studying virus strain- and cell-type-specific factors that may contribute to neurovirulence in vivo. It also highlights the specificity of HSV-1-host interactions,"" said Szpara. ""Our study suggests that differences observed between viral variants in cell-based models like neurons can be used to help understand the more-complex interactions of viruses with hosts.""

• The Heartland virus is a tick-borne virus that’s been found in multiple U.S. states.
• Symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite.
• At least 50 cases have been detected so far. A tick-borne virus is making headlines after new research showed that it’s appeared in multiple states. The Heartland virus was initially in 2009, but according to a recent study, it has now established itself in the state of Georgia. Researchers said that most cases were found in people with pre-existing conditions, and these illnesses were “predominately severe or fatal.” “Heartland is an emerging infectious disease that is not well understood,” Gonzalo Vazquez-Prokopec, PhD, the senior author of the study, said in a statement. “We’re trying to get ahead of this virus by learning everything that we can about it before it potentially becomes a bigger problem.”

According to an article published in in June 2009, two men from Northwestern Missouri, ages 57 and 67, were hospitalized after experiencing symptoms that included fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. After doctors ruled out several possible causes, PCR analysis and electron microscopy revealed that they’d contracted a previously unknown virus. It was later named Heartland virus and traced back to the lone star tick. The next cases weren’t discovered until 2012 when five Missouri residents and one Tennessee resident to have contracted the virus.

Five patients hospitalized with one fatality The patients were all men between 50 and 80 years old who presented with fever, low blood platelet count, and decreased white blood cell levels when first evaluated. They all reported fatigue and loss of appetite, and most also had headaches, nausea, and muscle or joint pain. Four of the five men were hospitalized, with one man dying. They’d all spent time outdoors, and most said that they were bitten by ticks within 2 weeks of becoming ill. Over 50 cases of Heartland virus have been identified as of January 2021, reported the . Cases have been found in the Midwestern and Southern United States, with most people diagnosed becoming sick from May through September. The cautions that all “residents of and visitors to areas where Heartland virus activity has been identified are at risk of Heartland virus infection,” particularly those who work or play outdoors.

Up to 2 weeks before symptoms appear “Most people who are infected with the heartland virus will experience symptoms similar to other tick-borne illnesses,” Anjali Bharati, DO, an emergency department doctor at Lenox Health Greenwich Village in New York, told Healthline. “It may take one to 2 weeks after the tick bite for any symptoms to appear,” she continued. “Some people who are elderly or chronically ill may experience more severe symptoms and need to be hospitalized.” According to Bharati, symptoms are similar to those associated with Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, with headache and fatigue the most common symptoms.

Lone star tick bites associated with serious illness Lone star ticks are found mostly in woodlands with dense undergrowth and animal resting areas. They can transmit germs that cause potentially deadly and . They’re “aggressive human biters,” and their bite is associated with the development of a red meat allergy in some people. The Emory University study identified the Heartland virus in three different specimen samples of lone star ticks that were collected in different locations and times and included nymph and adult stages of the ticks. Genetic analysis of three Georgia samples found that while their genomes were similar to one another, they were very different from that of Heartland virus samples outside the state. “These results suggest that the virus may be evolving very rapidly in different geographic locations, or that it may be circulating primarily in isolated areas and not dispersing quickly between those areas,” Vazquez-Prokopec said in a statement. Bharati confirmed that there are no known treatments for Heartland virus infection. However, many cases do resolve without medical treatment. “In many cases, patients need to be hospitalized to treat symptoms of dehydration or severe pain,” she said. “This virus also may cause low white blood cell counts, which increase the risk of other infections, and/or low platelets, which may increase the risk of bleeding.” She advises anyone experiencing symptoms of a tick-borne illness after spending time outdoors to see a healthcare professional.

Asian longhorned tick might also carry the disease Emory University researchers are also investigating the arrival of in Georgia. Native to China, Japan, Russia, and parts of the Pacific, the says that this tick was first detected in the United States in 2017 and has spread to many other states, including Georgia. The Asian longhorned tick carries bacteria and viruses that can pass to humans, including the . “We are investigating not only the potential agricultural impact of the Asian longhorned tick in Georgia, but the potential for this invasive tick to spread SFTS and other diseases to people,” Vazquez-Prokopec said in a statement.",0
16,"A large clinical trial to assess treatments for preventing people at high risk from developing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has begun. The study is comparing the safety and efficacy of a new MDR-TB drug, delamanid, with the decades-old TB drug isoniazid for preventing active MDR-TB disease in children, adolescents and adults at high risk who are exposed to adult household members with MDR-TB. Study participants are at high risk for MDR-TB because they either have latent TB infection, immune systems suppressed by HIV or other factors, or are younger than age 5 years and therefore have a weak immune system.

Most household members of people with MDR-TB are likely to acquire latent TB infection, in which the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis lives in the body without making a person sick. Without adequate preventive care, many of these individuals will progress to active MDR-TB disease, in which the bacteria become active and multiply. An estimated 460,000 people globally developed MDR-TB in 2017, according to the World Health Organization.

Existing treatments for MDR-TB are often highly toxic and poorly tolerated, placing patients at high risk of disability and death and curing them only about half the time. Treatment options are limited and expensive, and recommended medicines are not always available. Moreover, TB kills more people each year than any other infectious disease. For all these reasons, it is essential to prevent latent TB infection from progressing to active MDR-TB disease.

“It is important to perform randomized, controlled clinical trials on how best to provide preventive care for people who come in close contact with individuals with MDR-TB, since this is a major gap in global public health policy,” said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This new clinical trial will help fill that gap and hopefully define a way to avert much suffering, disability and death from MDR-TB.” Dr. Fauci directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is co-funding the study and is part of the National Institutes of Health.

Delamanid is one of the first drugs available specifically to treat people with MDR-TB and the first to exist in a formulation suitable for children. The study investigators hypothesize that prophylactic treatment with delamanid will prove better than isoniazid at reducing the likelihood that at-risk household members of individuals with MDR-TB will develop active TB disease. Isoniazid is the standard drug for TB prevention in many of the study’s host countries.

The Phase 3 clinical trial is called PHOENIx MDR-TB, short for Protecting Households on Exposure to Newly Diagnosed Index Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients. The study is co-funded by NIAID and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also part of NIH. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network, both funded by NIH, are conducting the PHOENIx MDR-TB study. The manufacturer of delamanid, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, is donating the drug to the trial.

Leading the study are Gavin Churchyard, M.B.B.Ch., M.Med., Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of the Aurum Institute for Health Research in Johannesburg; Amita Gupta, M.D., M.H.S., deputy director of the Center for Clinical Global Health Education and associate professor of medicine and international health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; Anneke Hesseling, M.D., Ph.D. director of the Desmond Tutu TB Centre in Cape Town, South Africa and distinguished professor in Paediatrics and Child Health at Stellenbosch University, South Africa; and Susan Swindells, M.B.B.S., professor of internal medicine and medical director of the Specialty Care Clinic at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

“We urgently need to halt the spread of MDR-TB,” said Dr. Churchyard, who also chairs the ACTG Tuberculosis Transformative Science Group. “Preventing latent MDR-TB from progressing to active disease protects the health of the individual while reducing the transmission of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.”

The PHOENIx MDR-TB study will take place at more than 27 sites in at least 12 countries, including Botswana, Brazil, Haiti, India, Kenya, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The study team will enroll approximately 5,610 participants, including 2,158 adults ages 18 and older who are being treated for confirmed active MDR-TB through their country’s national TB treatment program and 3,452 members of their households who are at high risk for developing active TB disease. The participating household members will be assigned at random to receive either oral delamanid daily for 26 weeks or oral isoniazid plus vitamin B6 daily for 26 weeks. All at-risk members of the same household will receive the same drug regimen.

Both delamanid and isoniazid have minimal potential for interacting with the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, according to UNAIDS, causing about one-third of all AIDS-related deaths.

Every two to 12 weeks, participating household contacts will visit the study clinic to undergo a physical exam and other health assessments, such as an electrocardiogram, testing of bodily fluids, or a questionnaire. The study team will follow participants for 96 weeks to see if they are protected from active TB disease. Final results from the trial are expected in 2024.

“A highly effective preventive TB therapy for vulnerable household members of people with active MDR-TB disease would be a game-changer in TB care,” said Dr. Hesseling, who chairs the IMPAACT Network’s Tuberculosis Scientific Committee.

The PHOENIx MDR-TB study participants with HIV who have not yet begun treatment for the virus are being referred to local health care providers for antiretroviral therapy, and the study team is documenting participants’ linkage to HIV care.

17,"Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center are reporting promising results from laboratory and animal experiments involving a new combination therapy for multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer.

The study published online in the journal Cancer Research details a dramatic increase in multiple myeloma cell death caused by a combination of the drugs obatoclax and flavopiridol. The researchers, led by Steven Grant, M.D., Shirley Carter Olsson and Sture Gordon Olsson Chair in Oncology Research, associate director for translational research, program co-leader and member of Developmental Therapeutics and member of the Cancer Cell Signaling program at VCU Massey Cancer Center, found that the two drugs worked together through different mechanisms to promote a form of cell suicide known as apoptosis.

""There is an urgent need for curative therapies for multiple myeloma,"" says Grant. ""Our hope is that this research will lay the foundation for new and more effective treatments for patients with multiple myeloma and potentially other blood cancers for which adequate therapies are lacking.""

Obatoclax is an experimental agent currently being investigated in various forms of blood cancers. It works by disabling proteins that prevent cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis. Flavopiridol is a member of a class of agents known as a cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK) inhibitors, and blocks the growth of cancer cells in addition to reducing levels of anti-apoptotic proteins.

In laboratory experiments, the novel drug combination dramatically increased multiple myeloma cell death. These results were confirmed in animal models where the drugs significantly improved the survival of immune-compromised mice with human multiple myeloma. An unexpected effect was also observed -- flavopiridol, in addition to reducing levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, significantly increased the expression of apoptosis-inducing proteins such as Bim, a protein shown in previous studies to trigger cell death.

""This research builds on nearly a decade of work carried out by our laboratory that focuses on manipulating mechanisms that lead to apoptosis in hematological malignancies,"" says Grant. ""Our findings could have immediate implications for the design of clinical trials using combinations of these types of drugs. In fact, plans to develop such a trial at Massey are currently underway.""

Because the findings showed synergism between these two classes of drugs, the researchers plan to test other clinically-relevant CDK inhibitors in combination with obatoclax for multiple myeloma.",0
20,"A team of scientists led by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory designed a molecule that disrupts the infection mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and could be used to develop new treatments for COVID-19 and other viral diseases.

The molecule targets a lesser-studied enzyme in COVID-19 research, PLpro, that helps the coronavirus multiply and hampers the host body's immune response. The molecule, called a covalent inhibitor, forms a strong chemical bond with its intended protein target and thus increases its effectiveness as an antiviral treatment.

""We're attacking the virus from a different front, which is a good strategy in infectious disease research,"" said Jerry Parks, who led the project and heads the Molecular Biophysics group at ORNL.

The research, detailed in Nature Communications, turned a previously identified noncovalent inhibitor of PLpro into a covalent one with higher potency, Parks said. Using mammalian cells, the team showed that the inhibitor molecule limits replication of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus strain as well as the Delta and Omicron variants.

The ORNL scientists used computational modeling to predict whether their designs would effectively bind to the enzyme and disrupt its function. They then synthesized the molecules and tested them at ORNL and partner company Progenra to confirm their predictions.

The protein was expressed and purified using the capabilities of the Center for Structural Molecular Biology at the Spallation Neutron Source, or SNS, at ORNL. The bright X-rays generated by the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, or SSRL, at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory were used to map the molecule and examine the binding process at an atomic level, validating the simulations. The SNS and SSRL are DOE Office of Science user facilities.

Partners at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Utah State University performed the testing on mammalian cells infected with the virus. Other collaborators on the project include the Stanford University School of Medicine, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Northeastern University.

""We took an existing compound and made it more potent by designing it to form a new chemical bond with PLpro,"" said ORNL chemist and lead author Brian Sanders. ""Our efforts are now to build on what we have developed to make better compounds that could one day be taken as a pill.""

Other ORNL scientists who collaborated on the project are Russell Davidson, Kevin Weiss, Qiu Zhang and Hugh O'Neill, while Audrey Labbe, Connor Cooper, Gwyndalyn Phillips, Stephanie Galanie and Marti Head are former staff.

The researchers are already working on a second generation of the covalent PLpro inhibitor that is more stable and better absorbed and distributed by the body, aiming to improve its suitability as an oral drug under the ORNL Technology Innovation Program.

The same design strategy of identifying a molecule, understanding how it binds to a target, and modifying it to make it more effective could be applied to understanding and combatting future viruses, the scientists noted.

""Antiviral drug discovery will always be needed and was one of the main motivations for this project,"" Parks said.

""If a new coronavirus emerges, our models and compounds can be used to continue the efforts for new antiviral drugs,"" Sanders said. ""We are working on checking the boxes that a potential industry or pharmaceutical partner would want to see. I find that very exciting.""

21,"WEDNESDAY, March 29, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- Children’s screen use could be altering their developing brains as they enter adolescence and increasing their risk for mood disorders, a major new study finds. Children ages 9 and 10 who spend more time on smartphones, tablets, video games and TV exhibited higher levels of depression and anxiety by the time they were 11 and 12, researchers found. Further, the investigators linked some of these mood disorders to actual structural changes occurring in the kids’ developing brains, according to the report published online recently in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions. “There were specific brain mechanisms that in part contributed to this relationship, meaning from a statistical perspective there were brain-based changes occurring over the two-year period that mediated the relationship between screen media activity in the younger children and internalizing concerns relating to depression and anxiety two years later,” said senior researcher Dr. Marc Potenza. He is a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine’s Child Study Center, in New Haven, Conn. The proportion of mood disorders associated with structural changes in the brain is relatively small, “on the order of 2% to 3%,” Potenza noted. But child development experts hailed the study as an important step toward fully understanding how excessive screen time affects children. For the study, Potenza and his colleagues analyzed data on more than 5,100 children participating in the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The data included brain scans, psychological evaluations and behavior tracking on these kids starting from ages 9 to 10. “This is the first time that we've had this kind of database to look at issues on this scale, so that's groundbreaking,” said Dr. Cheryl Wills, chief of child psychiatry with MetroHealth System in Cleveland. Wills was not involved with the study. “Basically, this study is the first one to begin to look at or understand better the processes that may be related to the impact of screen media activity on mental health — how does screen media activity impact brain development, and how does that impact mental health,” she said.

“While the findings are modest, this is the first structural association with these changes,” added Wills, who is also a board member of the American Psychiatric Association. When the researchers looked at the first round of data for 9- and 10-year-olds, they found a relationship between high levels of screen use and mood disorders, as well as “externalizing” behaviors like aggression and discipline, Potenza said. They also observed brain structure patterns in those children similar to those associated with underage drinking in previous studies, he added. They then followed the kids as they aged, to see if the mental health problems persisted and whether they correlated with any further brain changes. As 11- and 12-year-olds, the kids continued to have depression and anxiety related to heavy screen use, and their brains had changed in ways that would explain some of those mood disorders. However, the study did not link the same brain changes to heavy screen use and behavior problems like aggression, bullying or defiance. The observed brain changes involved both the cortical brain regions involved in higher-level processes like attention or emotional regulation, as well as subcortical regions related to a person’s urges, Potenza said. “Given that this brain structural variation pattern has been linked to early engagement in addictive behaviors, it suggests that perhaps there may be some elements that are shared between addictive behaviors across substance use and non-substance-use domains — in this case, screen media activity,” Potenza added. The ABCD study will continue to track the same children as they age, and future reports are expected to provide even more insight into how screens affect the developing brain, said Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer for the American Psychological Association. “I don't think most of the public realizes how important the puberty years are for brain development,” Prinstein said. “We all know that infants have their brains developing in really important ways, but we might not remember that brain development around the ages of 12 to 16 is also an incredibly sensitive time.”

“This is the first step, and we'll see how this proceeds, whether or not it's consistent through the developmental process as children mature into adults or whether this stops at a certain age or whether it worsens at a certain age,” Wills said. “It's helping us to begin to understand that this can impact mental health, this can impact brain development. And only time will tell how persistent the changes are, whether or not they change over time and what are the outcomes.” The post-pandemic world has made it more important than ever to understand the affect that screen-based media have on children, Wills said. “During COVID time, a lot of education switched to computers and screen media. Even though kids are mostly back in school, teachers are using screens to a greater extent than they did beforehand,” Wills said. “Usually in the past you'd have your child come home and then you worry about screen media activity, but they're already coming home from school having had more exposure in school than they previously did.” Many parents are trying to limit children’s screen activity by using timers to shut the devices down when the kids have had enough, Wills said. They’re also setting up other activities, “and basically trying to get their children to focus on other things rather than the screens.” In the meantime, Prinstein recommends that parents set a hard-and-fast 9 p.m. deadline for screen use. “We just need that to be a rule. We can’t disrupt sleep. Sleep is incredibly important for brain development, and the number one reason why kids are not getting the sleep that’s recommended is because of their screens,” Prinstein said. Parents should also take advantage of timers and controls to make sure they’re limiting what kids can do on devices and for how long. “Those aren’t perfect, but at least it’s a start,” Prinstein said. Finally, parents need to have a frank talk with their kids about whether the children themselves feel like they’re using screens too much.",0

24,"The clinical trial began in 2019 and involved 3,900 volunteers.

An investigational HIV vaccine regimen tested among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people was safe but did not provide protection against HIV acquisition, an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has determined. The HPX3002/HVTN 706, or “Mosaico,” Phase 3 clinical trial began in 2019 and involved 3,900 volunteers ages 18 to 60 years in Europe, North America and South America. Based on the DSMB’s recommendation, the study will be discontinued. Participants are being notified of the findings, and further analyses of the study data are planned.

Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, sponsored the Mosaico study with funding support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The trial was conducted by the NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Network, based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command provided additional study support.

The experimental vaccine regimen was developed by Janssen. It was based on “mosaic” immunogens—vaccine components featuring elements of multiple HIV subtypes—with the goal of inducing immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains. The investigational vaccine regimen consisted of four injections over a year of Ad26.Mos4.HIV. This vaccine candidate uses a common-cold virus (adenovirus serotype 26, or Ad26) to deliver the mosaic immunogens. The final two vaccinations were accompanied by a bivalent (two-component) HIV envelope protein formulation, combining clade C gp140 and mosaic gp140 envelope proteins, adjuvanted by aluminum phosphate to boost immune responses. All study vaccinations were completed in October 2022.

In its scheduled data review, the DSMB determined there were no safety issues with the experimental vaccine regimen. However, the number of HIV infections were equivalent between the vaccine and placebo arms of the study. During the clinical trial, all participants were offered comprehensive HIV prevention tools, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Study staff ensured that participants who acquired HIV during the trial were promptly referred for medical care and treatment.

The Mosaico findings track with developments in the Phase 2b “Imbokodo” (HPX2008/HVTN 705) clinical trial, which was testing a similar HIV vaccine regimen in young women in sub-Saharan Africa. A DSMB determined in 2021 that the experimental vaccine regimen in that study was also safe but ineffective in protecting against HIV acquisition.

30,"Researchers have identified 57 genetic variations of a gene strongly associated with declines in blood oxygen levels during sleep. Low oxygen levels during sleep are a clinical indicator of the severity of sleep apnea, a disorder that increases the risk of heart disease, dementia, and death. The study, published today in the American Journal of Human Genetics, was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“A person’s average blood oxygen levels during sleep are hereditary, and relatively easy to measure,” said study author Susan Redline, M.D., senior physician in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston. “Studying the genetic basis of this trait can help explain why some people are more susceptible to sleep disordered breathing and its related morbidities.”

When we sleep, the oxygen level in our blood drops, due to interruptions in breathing. Lung and sleep disorders tend to decrease those levels further, and dangerously so. But the range of those levels during sleep varies widely between individuals and, researchers suspect, is greatly influenced by genetics.

Despite the key role blood oxygen levels play in health outcomes, the influence of genetics on their variability remains understudied. The current findings contribute to a better understanding, particularly because researchers looked at overnight measurements of oxygen levels. Those provide more variability than daytime levels due to the stresses associated with disordered breathing occurring during sleep.

The researchers analyzed whole genome sequence data from the NHLBI’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. To strengthen the data, they incorporated results of family-based linkage analysis, a method for mapping genes that carry hereditary traits to their location in the genome. The method uses data from families with several members affected by a particular disorder.

“This study highlights the advantage of using family data in searching for rare variants, which is often missed in genome-wide association studies,” said James Kiley, Ph.D., director of the Division of Lung Diseases at NHLBI. “It showed that, when guided by family linkage data, whole genome sequence analysis can identify rare variants that signal disease risks, even with a small sample. In this case, the initial discovery was done with fewer than 500 samples.”

The newly identified 57 variants of the DLC1 gene were clearly associated with the fluctuation in oxygen levels during sleep. In fact, they explained almost 1% of the variability in the oxygen levels in European Americans, which is relatively high for complex genetic phenotypes, or traits, that are influenced by myriad variants.

Notably, 51 of the 57 genetic variants influence and regulate human lung fibroblast cells, a type of cell producing scar tissue in the lungs, according to study author Xiaofeng Zhu, Ph.D., professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland.

“This is important because Mendelian Randomization analysis, a statistical approach for testing causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome, shows a potential causal relationship between how the DLC1 gene modifies fibroblasts cells and the changes in oxygen levels during sleep,” he said.

This relationship, Kiley added, suggests that a shared molecular pathway, or a common mechanism, may be influencing a person’s susceptibility to the lack of oxygen caused by sleep disordered breathing and other lung illnesses such as emphysema.

The project was jointly led by Zhu and Redline, who also directs the National Sleep Research Resource, supported by NHLBI.

31,"Aug. 11, 2022 – A new blood test that can detect up to 50 cancers from a single blood sample is gaining traction in the United States. The Galleri blood test is being offered by several U.S. health networks, which have teamed up with the company that developed it. They include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mercy Health, Ochsner Health, Intermountain Healthcare, Community Health Network, Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, Premier, and Cleveland Clinic. Cleveland Clinic's Eric Klein, MD, is enthusiastic about the test, describing it in a blog post as “game-changing” because it can detect many different cancers and at a very early stage. Current screening for cancer focuses on one cancer at a time: for example, mammograms for breast cancer and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer. In contrast, the Galleri test involves just one blood sample, which is then analyzed for particles that are shed by all cancers into the bloodstream, known as cell-free or circulating tumor DNA. It detects whether there is cancer present, and where the cancer may be. This test “completely changes the way we think about screening for cancer,” says Jeff Venstrom, MD, chief medical officer at GRAIL, the company marketing the test. But there is some concern among doctors that widespread use of the test is premature. Having a blood test for multiple cancers is a “very good idea, and the scientific basis for this platform is sound,” says Timothy Rebbeck, PhD, with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “But the devil is in the details to ensure the test can accurately detect very early cancers and there is a pathway for subsequent workup (diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, etc.),” he says. Galleri is being offered to people who are older than 50 and who have a family history of cancer, or who are at higher risk for cancer, or who have compromised immune systems. The company recommends that people interested in the test get in touch with their health care provider, who then needs to register with GRAIL and order the test.

In addition to a prescription from a health care provider, people who want the test will have to pay for it out of pocket, around $950. The test is not covered by medical insurance, and the FDA has not approved it. The company emphasizes that the Galleri test is intended to complement (not replace) recommended cancer screenings, such as mammograms. This is a “screening” test for people who do not have cancer, and so it is intended to be used by primary care doctors, Rebbeck says. He warns that “clinical pathways are not yet in place” for primary care providers to process the results of the test, although he says they are being developed. The test returns one of two possible results – either ""positive, cancer signal detected"" or ""negative, no cancer signal detected."" According to the company, the test also predicts where the cancer sign is coming from “with high accuracy,” which helps guide the next steps to diagnosis. One problem is a patient may face multiple follow-up tests if their test comes back positive, says Sameek Roychowdhury, MD, PhD, with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus. “Not everybody will have an actual cancer, but they may undergo many tests, with a lot of stress and cost and still not find anything. I can tell you every time someone undergoes a test looking for cancer, that is not an easy day,” he says. In a large-scale study, the Galleri test had a “false-positive” rate of less than 1%. This means that in roughly 200 people tested without cancer, only one received a result saying cancer was detected when it wasn’t there. The accuracy of the test varies with different types of cancers, and also how advanced they are. Rebbeck says the test is still “relatively poor for detecting very early cancers, so it will need additional tweaking before it really achieves the goal of multi-cancer early detection.” Venstrom acknowledges that the test is “not perfect yet” and says the company will continue to update and improve its performance. New data is expected in September, he says. Data on how the test performs in clinical practice is being gathered in the United Kingdom, where the Galleri test is being used in a large trial by the National Health Service (NHS). About 140,000 healthy cancer-free volunteers have signed on to take part in the trial.",0
33,"The retinoblastoma (RB) susceptibility gene was the first gatekeeper gene discovered for cancer. When it was removed, or damaged, cancers thrived. Over the years, researchers discovered many methods to experimentally remove the RB gene in order to study it, but just how the gene's loss made cancers more aggressive in patients was poorly understood. By studying patient samples, researchers at Thomas Jefferson University and colleagues found how one type of RB removal, but not another, caused large-scale genetic changes that could make cancer both resistant to treatment and more likely to spread.

""RB loss causes a major reprogramming of gene expression, allowing induction of pathways that promote features that induce characteristics of lethal disease,"" said senior author Karen Knudsen, PhD, Director of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Thomas Jefferson University. The study is the first to identify the molecular consequences of RB loss and illustrate the clinical relevance of RB-loss-induced transcriptional rewiring.

The work involved a multinational collaboration between SKCC investigators at Thomas Jefferson University and other US-based laboratories, as well as clinical and basic science researchers in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Finland and Sweden. It was published online December 4th in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.

Spearheaded by first author Christopher McNair, PhD, a graduate student in the laboratory of Dr. Knudsen, the study undertook an extensive analysis of tumor samples and cell-free DNA samples from patients with advanced, lethal-stage prostate cancer. Although there are several ways to remove RB from the cellular machinery, the group found that complete loss, rather than inactivation, of the RB gene was associated with changes in gene-networks closely linked to aggressive disease. Surprisingly, the cancer-promoting program that RB-loss unleashed was distinct from the cell-cycle control genes that RB is best known for controlling.

The new findings hold great promise for further clinical development and application. First, the research demonstrates that RB status can be tracked using cell-free DNA samples, an approach referred to as ""liquid biopsy,"" in prostate cancer patient samples. This method will facilitate the analysis of patient tumors and the selection of the most appropriate therapy based on the individualized features of each patient's cancer subtype. Multiple clinical trials are now underway in Philadelphia that will determine the impact of RB status as a means to guide more precise cancer therapy. ""Unlike breast cancer, all prostate cancers are currently treated in an identical fashion. This discovery, and the clinical trials we have underway, suggest that RB status might be used as means to stratify patients into more effective treatment regimens,"" said William Kevin Kelly, leader of the Prostate Cancer Program at SKCC.

In addition to Drs. McNair and Knudsen, SKCC investigator Benjamin Leiby, PhD, also contributed to the study. The SKCC is one of only eight National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers with a Program in Excellence in Prostate Cancer.

The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute CA159945, CA217329, and CA176401 to KEK, 4R00CA178199, the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas RR140072, the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Support Grant 5P30CA056036-17 and the Biostatistics Shared Resource, the Prostate Cancer Foundation Challenge Award, the European Research Council ERCCoG648670, and, in part, the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

34,"Many wives of advanced prostate cancer sufferers feel that their lives are being undermined by their husband’s illness, with nearly half reporting that their own health suffered. In addition a focus subgroup has revealed that many feel isolated and fearful, and worry about the role change in their lives as their husband’s cancer advances. This study, developed with the wives of men with metastatic prostate cancer who were being treated with hormone therapy, is amongst the first carried out on how prostate cancer affects the partners of sufferers. It was presented yesterday at the EAU conference in Copenhagen.

Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer. Prostate cancer which metastisises to other parts of the body is often difficult or impossible to cure, and so is often treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which slows down the tumour growth. ADT shuts down production of the hormone testosterone, but that leads to fatigue, frailty, and loss of sexual drive. The effects of prostate cancer and its treatment have been extensively studied in men, but there is almost no work on how this affects their partners.

A team of Danish researchers from Herlev and Gentofte University Hospital, led by registered nurse Jeanne Avlastenok and Dr. Peter Østergren, have been working with the wives and partners of men who had been undergoing exercise therapy to maintain body strength and resilience during prostate cancer treatment. They questioned 56 women on how the cancers were affecting the lives of their husbands. Nearly half of these women (26 women, i.e. 46%) reported that their partner’s health problem had affected their own health.

The researchers randomly selected 8 women for in-depth, focus-group style interviews – aimed at encouraging the women to express how they are being affected by their partner’s illness.

“We worked with the women as a group, encouraging them to be open about what they felt in a supportive group environment”, said Jeanne Avlastenok.

“Three of the women – those with early stage disease – were less burdened than the others, but the remaining five expressed some significant concerns.

Many felt increasingly socially isolated. Their husbands were fatigued both by the illness and by the treatment, which meant that they couldn’t socialize as a couple, which made the women feel cut off from social support”.

Sample Comment: ''Because he sleeps so much we do not visit the family or our friends and do not have many guests'' said one.

RN Jeanne Avlastenok continued, “They also gradually developed a real fear of being alone, even within the relationship. They felt that they had to be strong, which meant that they couldn’t share the burden of the illness.

The last theme which worried the women was over the role change in their relationship. As their men became less able to fulfil their usual roles, the women had to undertake tasks which had previously fallen to the men. Many of these are simple tasks but for the women they represented a sea change in the way their lives were structured”.

Sample Comment: 'We have 22 windows and my husband thinks that he still can polish them and also do all the gardening. But nothing happens and he doesn't want me to arrange professional help''

All of the women were worried that their husbands would develop significant pain as the disease progressed.

The team stresses that the focus group findings is very much qualitative work on a small sample. “But in any study, you need to do the qualitative work before moving to any larger sample”, said Dr. Peter Østergren, “We needed to let the women express their concerns first, so we can understand which questions to ask

“Many prostate cancer patients have a hard time, both physically and emotionally, and this work shows that this stress can spill over and affect wives and partners. This is good for neither of them. Good mental and emotional health needs to be part of how we judge a treatment, and we need to try to ensure that both patients and their partners get the support they both need”.

Only departmental funds were used for this research.",0

36,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic is well-positioned, with remarkable progress in 2019, to reinforce its leadership in patient care, research and education, and drive forward the transformation of health care over the next decade.

Mayo Clinic's path to 2030 is rooted in its patient-centered values and humanitarian mission, to cure, connect and transform health care globally. With digital innovations and new technologies, Mayo Clinic is moving quickly to extend its compassionate care, expertise and research, and is reinvesting hundreds of millions of dollars in people and facilities in the communities it serves.

Seventy thousand people — including 5,000 physicians and scientists — advance Mayo Clinic’s mission and spearhead initiatives to improve the lives of people everywhere. Bolstered by the past year's performance and the culture of innovation, they will continue to cure, solve the most complex medical problems, and lead the way in transforming health care for all.

""As a global leader in health care, with patients at the center of our work, Mayo Clinic has a critical role to play,"" says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., Mayo Clinic president and CEO. ""We are leading the necessary changes in health care to benefit people worldwide.""

Mayo Clinic in Rochester was named the No. 1 hospital in the nation for the fourth consecutive year by U.S. News & World Report in 2019. Mayo Clinic in Rochester received more No. 1 rankings in medical specialty areas than any other U.S. medical center.

Also in 2019, Mayo launched its first major digital venture, the Clinical Data Analytics Platform, which enables researchers to build artificial intelligence and machine learning models to gain insights from data and develop new therapies, solve complex medical problems and improve the lives of patients.

Mayo Clinic has accelerated its investment in the digital transformation of health care, one of the pillars of its 2030 strategy to transform patient and clinician experiences and solve humanity’s most complex medical challenges. John Halamka, M.D., was named president of Mayo Clinic Platform, to implement strategies to assure Mayo Clinic's leadership in digital health care, and Rita Khan was named chief digital officer to guide strategy and establish the Mayo Clinic Center for Digital Health.

""2019 was a year of remarkable growth and reinvestment in Mayo Clinic's mission,"" says Farrugia, who became president and CEO in January 2019 and charted a year of important transitions in clinic leadership. ""Through this period of rapidly accelerating change, our staff has maintained our commitment to the highest quality care for our patients, while conducting life-changing research and providing medical education that will shape the future. Our exceptional team members will continue to distinguish Mayo Clinic as a truly world-class health care organization.""

In 2019, Mayo Clinic's total revenue was $13.82 billion, 9.7% higher than in 2018. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong inpatient, outpatient and surgical volumes across Mayo Clinic's destination sites in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.

More than 1.2 million patients, from every state and more than 130 countries, received care at Mayo Clinic in 2019, with a 2.1% increase in hospital inpatients and a 3.6% increase in surgical patients compared with 2018.

Net operating income in 2019 was $1.06 billion. Generous benefactors contributed $549 million, an increase of 9% over 2018. In addition, benefactors signaled their confidence in Mayo Clinic’s vision to transform health care by making more than $500 million in future commitments, to be realized in the years ahead.

Revenue from diversified sources such as Mayo Clinic Laboratories and Mayo Clinic Ventures and Business Development was $1.29 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.1%, and the Mayo Clinic Care Network expanded to 44 health care organizations in the U.S. and abroad, extending the expertise and knowledge of Mayo Clinic staff to nearly 11.4 million patients through its connected care platform. Also in keeping with Mayo Clinic's commitment to extend its expertise internationally, it announced a joint venture with Abu Dhabi Health Services Company to operate Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, one of the United Arab Emirates’ largest hospitals for patients with complex medical conditions.

""Our strong performance in 2019, financially and in patient care, research, and educating the next generation of health care providers, positions us well for the important work that lies ahead,"" says Jeff Bolton, Mayo Clinic's chief administrative officer. ""This could not happen without the talent and dedication of our outstanding staff and the confidence and support of the patients we serve.""

Mayo Clinic is proud to be the largest employer in the state of Minnesota and a leading employer in Florida, Arizona and the dozens of communities in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin served by Mayo Clinic Health System. In 2019, employee salaries and benefits totaled $8.29 billion. A special year-end payment of $200 million was made to Mayo Clinic staff pension funds, in addition to $345 million for current service cost. Since 2015, Mayo Clinic has contributed $2.4 billion to its pension funds.

""We continue to invest in our most important asset, our staff, through salary increases, pension funding, a strong and competitive benefit package, and a firm commitment to diversity and inclusion,"" Bolton says. ""We have long been known for our collaborative, team-oriented approach to health care, and it's the people of Mayo Clinic who are responsible for our success.""

Mayo Clinic also contributes to local, state and national economies as a major taxpayer. In 2019, it paid nearly $171 million in taxes, including $108 million in MinnesotaCare taxes, $28 million in real property/business personal property taxes, $24 million in income taxes, and $11 million in sales and use taxes.

Mayo Clinic is committed to ensuring that the needs of patients come first and that patients have access to the appropriate level of care. In 2019, it provided $590 million in uncompensated care, including $96 million in charity care and $494 million in unpaid portions of Medicaid and indigent care programs.

Working with local communities to address important needs has long been part of Mayo Clinic's mission, and Mayo Clinic staff contributed time, talent and resources in 2019 to increase affordable housing units, address hunger and homelessness, improve access to high-quality health care, and other community issues.

""We recognize that as the communities we serve change, so do their needs,"" says Erin Sexton, director of Enterprise Community Engagement. ""This is why Mayo Clinic became a key partner in establishing the Coalition for Rochester Area Housing, to create and preserve affordable housing. In its two years of existence, this collaborative community program has resulted in more than 300 new units of affordable housing.""

Increased access to services and improved community support for people facing mental illness was a key area of focus for Mayo Clinic in 2019. Mayo Clinic in Florida has been part of an effort to educate Jacksonville residents in Mental Health First Aid, with the goal of eliminating the stigma and increasing awareness of mental health issues. In Rochester, Mayo Clinic has partnered with the community and state to build and operate a 24/7 behavioral health crisis center. Construction will begin this year. To help address the nationwide shortage of mental health care providers, the Mayo Clinic Psychiatry Residency Program in Rochester will expand to include Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire.

Mayo Clinic invested in hundreds of organizations across all of its communities in 2019, and it added a special year-end Season of Giving initiative to provide extra support for community needs. ""Helping to address community needs is embedded in Mayo Clinic's mission and the values of Mayo Clinic staff,"" Sexton says.

Mayo Clinic made substantial new investments in medical research and education in 2019, with a 7.8% increase in funding, totaling $1.3 billion. Funding for research grew to $891 million in 2019, an 8% increase, and investments in Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science and educational programs were $377 million, a 7.4% increase.

The year's robust growth allowed Mayo Clinic to invest $723 million in capital projects in 2019 that will improve patient care and experience, as well as assure continued leadership in research and education. The projects included $293 million for new facilities and technology, and $430 million to maintain or replace equipment and technology.

In addition, projects totaling $505 million received Board of Trustee approval during the year:
• $233 million for expansion of the Integrated Oncology facility at Mayo Clinic in Florida. This investment will provide the full spectrum of leading-edge cancer treatments, including proton and carbon beam therapy, for Mayo Clinic patients in the southeast U.S. and nationally. This investment will bring carbon therapy to the U.S. for the benefit of patients nationwide.
• $91 million for a new research and education center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, part of Mayo's Arizona Bold Forward Project, which will nearly double the size of the Phoenix campus.
• $85 million for the new Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Building at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, which Dr. Farrugia says will ""enable us to meet a critical need for research space on our Rochester campus"" as a result of a remarkable gift from benefactors.

""These investments are essential to having the capacity and capabilities to meet the expectations of our patients with state-of-the-art facilities and technology,"" says Dennis Dahlen, Mayo Clinic's chief financial officer. ""Continuing our position of industry leadership requires continued investment on the leading edge of medical science. We're investing in transformative changes to position Mayo Clinic for a rapidly changing health care environment.""

Mayo Clinic continues to invest in staff and modernization of facilities and technology at Mayo Clinic Health System sites, to assure the highest quality and most efficient care. Mayo has invested $11 million at Mayo Clinic Health System – Albert Lea and Austin to modernize and expand the medical surgical inpatient unit and Family Birth Center on the Austin campus, enhancing the patient experience, and a nearly $1 million chemotherapy and infusion therapy pharmacy was constructed on the Albert Lea campus. Investments have been made in imaging equipment such as MRI and CT scanners across Mayo Clinic Health System to ensure that patients receive the same high-quality care at all sites.

Mayo Clinic Health System also is exploring new ways to serve patients in its communities. In Barron, Wisconsin, a program called the Barron Model of Care involves providing all types of care except for advanced surgical procedures in the local critical access hospital by using telemedicine and virtual visits. The Barron model has the potential to revolutionize how Mayo Clinic Health System provides rural health care. Patients in the Barron area will no longer need to travel to the larger Mayo Clinic Health System hospital in Eau Claire for consultations or other diagnostic work; instead, technology will enable them to receive care in their hometown. Program results will be analyzed with the goal of replicating it in other Mayo Clinic Health System communities.

""Mayo Clinic had an exceptional year, which has enabled us to reinvest boldly in all areas of our mission,"" Dr. Farrugia says. ""At a time of profound change, it's more important than ever that we remain true to the values of our founders, who put the needs of our patients first. These are not just words, it's an organizing principle and a deeply personal commitment. By keeping our strategies aligned with the needs of our patients, regardless of place or platform, and no matter how complex, Mayo Clinic will continue to excel as a place of health and healing.""

39,"Long-term consumption of Allura Red food dye can be a potential trigger of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, says McMaster University's Waliul Khan. Researchers using experimental animal models of IBD found that continual exposure to Allura Red AC harms gut health and promotes inflammation.

The dye directly disrupts gut barrier function and increases the production of serotonin, a hormone/neurotransmitter found in the gut, which subsequently alters gut microbiota composition leading to increased susceptibility to colitis.

Khan said Allura Red (also called FD&C Red 40 and Food Red 17), is a common ingredient in candies, soft drinks, dairy products and some cereals. The dye is used to add colour and texture to foodstuffs, often to attract children.

The use of synthetic food dyes such as Allura Red has increased significantly over the last several decades, but there has been little earlier study of these dyes' effects on gut health. Khan and his team published their findings in Nature Communications. Yun Han (Eric) Kwon, who recently completed PhD in Khan's laboratory, is first author.

""This study demonstrates significant harmful effects of Allura Red on gut health and identifies gut serotonin as a critical factor mediating these effects. These findings have important implication in the prevention and management of gut inflammation,"" said Khan, the study's senior author, a professor of the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine and a principal investigator of Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute.

""What we have found is striking and alarming, as this common synthetic food dye is a possible dietary trigger for IBDs. This research is a significant advance in alerting the public on the potential harms of food dyes that we consume daily,"" he said.

""The literature suggests that the consumption of Allura Red also affects certain allergies, immune disorders and behavioural problems in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.""

Khan said that IBDs are serious chronic inflammatory conditions of the human bowel that affect millions of people worldwide. While their exact causes are still not fully understood, studies have shown that dysregulated immune responses, genetic factors, gut microbiota imbalances, and environmental factors can trigger these conditions.

In recent years there has been significant progress in identifying susceptibility genes and understanding the role of the immune system and host microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBDs. However, similar advances in defining environmental risk factors have lagged, he said.

Khan said that environmental triggers for IBDs include the typical Western diet, which includes processed fats, red and processed meats, sugar and a lack of fibre. He added that the Western diet and processed food also includes large amounts of various additives and dyes.

He added that the study suggests a link between a commonly used food dye and IBDs and warrants further exploration between food dyes and IBDs at experimental, epidemiological and clinical levels.

46,"The amount of SARS-CoV-2 antigen measured in the blood of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with illness severity and other clinical outcomes, according to a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Following the ACTIV-3 trial of COVID-19 therapeutics in people hospitalized with COVID-19, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their collaborators analyzed levels of SARS-COV-2 antigen in blood samples taken from study participants and assessed the association of those levels with disease progression. Higher levels of viral antigen in the blood, which could indicate ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication, correlated with more severe disease. The authors suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels hold promise as a biomarker, or a measurable substance, to predict which patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have a higher risk of worse outcomes.

The ACTIV-3 trial enrolled people hospitalized with COVID-19 between August 2020 and November 2021. Participants contributed a baseline blood sample and were then randomized to receive either an experimental COVID-19 therapeutic or a placebo. All participants received the antiviral remdesivir unless contraindicated. In this follow-up analysis, the researchers examined 2,540 participant baseline blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels.

The researchers assessed the relationship between each participant’s SARS-CoV-2 blood antigen levels and their time to discharge from the hospital, as well as their pulmonary symptoms at day five of the trial—whether they had stayed the same, worsened, or improved since enrollment. With all this information in hand, the researchers conducted statistical analyses to determine if plasma antigen levels were associated with the participants’ pulmonary function when they gave the blood sample—and whether they could predict how the participants would fare over time. In addition, the researchers examined the relationship between a number of participant and viral characteristics and antigen levels.

The analysis revealed a strong correlation between higher SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels (≥1000 nanograms per liter) and worse pulmonary function at the time of enrollment. Importantly, participants with higher SARS-CoV-2 antigen levels in the blood at enrollment

generally had decreased pulmonary function at day five, regardless of the severity of their illness at the time of study entry, and took longer to be released from the hospital. High blood antigen levels also correlated with some known risk factors for worse illness, such as being male. Three additional participant characteristics were found to correlate with lower antigen levels: the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, exposure to remdesivir prior to enrollment and longer time in hospital prior to enrollment. Finally, participants infected with the delta variant had higher antigen levels than those infected with prior circulating strains. The researchers concluded that antigen levels in the blood are likely a marker of ongoing viral replication and could be useful for predicting a patient’s disease progression and likely outcomes once they are admitted to the hospital. The authors note that these results suggest that a precision medicine approach could be helpful in future clinical trials of antiviral therapy. For instance, antigen levels could help determine those patients most likely to benefit from therapies directed at fighting the virus.

48,"Findings give new insights into the connection between poor air quality, children’s health, and mother’s health.

A new report from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) suggests that traffic-related air pollution increases a pregnant woman’s risk for dangerous increases in blood pressure, known as hypertension.

NTP scientists evaluated published research on the link between traffic-related air pollution, or TRAP, and hypertensive disorders broken down by pollutant measurements of TRAP, such as particulate matter (PM ). PM is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air, and PM refers to fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers or smaller. The average human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter, about 30 times larger than the largest fine particle.

“What we found when we reviewed the literature is that exposure to PM from traffic emissions was associated with development of hypertensive disorders in pregnant women,” said Brandy Beverly, Ph.D., lead scientist and researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health. “When these women are exposed to PM during their entire pregnancy, the likelihood of developing preeclampsia increases by about 50%.”

Other components of TRAP that NTP evaluated included nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, black carbon, and elemental carbon, along with parameters like traffic density and mothers’ proximity to main roads.

For example, the literature suggests that women who live within a quarter of a mile of a major roadway or in high traffic density regions may be at an increased risk for developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

TRAP comes from the combustion of fossil fuels by motor vehicles. These vehicle emissions are mixtures of gases and particles that are easily inhaled and have adverse health effects. TRAP is known to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate more than 10% of pregnancies worldwide and are a leading cause of maternal and fetal illness and death. According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, mothers with hypertension during pregnancy are more likely to have a pre-term delivery. Their infants are at greater risk for low birthweight and a range of long-term health problems associated with pre-mature birth.

“Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy refer to a range of clinical conditions, all of which include high blood pressure during pregnancy,” said Beverly. “The disorders are classified into four distinct types, based on differences in the timing and onset of the symptoms.”

Pregnant women may experience four types of hypertensive disorders:
• Gestational hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the second half of pregnancy.
• Preeclampsia, or high blood pressure with protein in urine or impaired liver or kidney function, in the second half of pregnancy. If preeclampsia worsens and causes seizures, it becomes eclampsia – a serious condition for mother and child with the potential to be fatal.
• Chronic hypertension, or high blood pressure before pregnancy or early in pregnancy, that continues throughout pregnancy.
• Chronic hypertension with preeclampsia, or high blood pressure before pregnancy or early in pregnancy, that continues throughout pregnancy and is complicated by new onset protein in the urine or impaired liver or kidney function.

Using their standard four-tier scale to classify human hazards, NTP looked at the combined evidence from the individual components and concluded that TRAP is a presumed human hazard for hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, though they weren’t able to distinguish between the four types of disorders. The scale ranges from the highest hazard rating of “known”, followed by “presumed”, then “suspected”, and finally, “not classifiable”.

NTP conducted the systematic review of published research on hypertensive disorders in pregnant women and its link to TRAP after receiving a nomination from several pediatricians to evaluate the connection between emerging issues associated with air pollution and children’s health.

NTP scientists performed a comprehensive literature search and reviewed hundreds of studies with potentially relevant data. Overall, they evaluated 18 human observational studies and one animal study that specifically addressed hypertension during pregnancy and TRAP. Usually, experimental animal data add confidence in the conclusions; unfortunately, the limited number of animal studies that assessed the impact of environmental exposures during pregnancy is a research gap.

The evaluation underwent external peer review involving experts from academia and industry, who evaluated NTP’s draft conclusions and agreed unanimously with NTP’s final conclusion.

57,"Physicians prescribed opioids more often to their white patients who complained of new-onset low back pain than to their Black, Asian and Hispanic patients during the early days of the national opioid crisis, when prescriptions for these powerful painkillers were surging but their dangers were not fully apparent, according to a UCLA study.

The findings suggest that doctors may have commonly dispensed pain treatments unequally based on race and ethnicity. The study shows that physicians were more likely to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs -- a less-powerful alternative -- to their patients of color who came to them for back pain care.

""This appears to be a case of differential treatment of pain or bias by physicians, in which the pain of certain patients deserves opioids and the pain of others does not,"" said Dr. Dan Ly, the study's author and an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The fact that, in hindsight, more white patients developed dangerous long-term opioid use doesn't absolve physicians of this differential treatment.""

The paper is published today in the peer-reviewed JAMA Health Forum.

Ly examined nationwide medical claims data from 2006 through 2015 for about 275,000 Medicare beneficiaries who were 66 or older and were experiencing new-onset low back pain. Approximately 81% of these patients were white, 6% were Black, 6% were Asian/Pacific Islander and 8% were Hispanic.

Focusing on how individual doctors prescribed opioids differently based on their patients' race and ethnicity, Ly found that, on average, these drugs were dispensed to 11.5% of white patients, versus about 10% of Black patients, 9% of Asian/Pacific Islander patients and 10.5% of Hispanic patients.

Among patients who seemed to have severe or longer-lasting pain -- measured as five or more visits to the doctor for back pain in a year -- the differences were starker: 36% of white patients were prescribed opioids, versus about 30% of Black patients, 21% of Asian/Pacific Islanders and 24% of Hispanics. Physicians, Ly said, also tended to prescribe opioids sooner to their white patients.

Conversely, doctors prescribed NSAIDs to 25% of their Black patients, 25% of Asian/Pacific Islanders and 28% of Hispanics but only to 24% of whites -- again, with greater differences for patients with more visits for their back pain.

The study also found that white patients with new low back pain were subsequently more likely to develop long-term reliance on opioids than patients of Black, Asian/Pacific Islander or Hispanic origin.

One possible reason for these prescribing discrepancies, Ly said, is that physicians may have had less confidence that patients of color would not misuse opioids, even though studies have shown no difference in rates of opioid misuse between patients of color and white patients. It's also possible, he said, that patients of color may have asked for opioids less frequently than white patients, although there is no evidence for this.

Ly noted that because this was an observational study, there may have been other, non-observable factors that contributed to prescribing discrepancies. The findings do not include results from physical exams, which may have influenced prescribing decisions, and over-the-counter medications were not included in the data.

59,"The impact of high breathing efforts on the lungs of patients suffering with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 has been investigated by researchers at the University of Warwick, who assessed the likelihood of resulting lung injury.

Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention, the potential for mechanical ventilators to further damage already diseased lungs by applying excessive pressures and forces is now well recognised among intensive care clinicians, who implement specific protocols to minimise the risk of so-called ventilator-induced-lung-injury.

Since the start of the current pandemic, some clinicians have argued that similar injuries could potentially be produced by heightened respiratory efforts in spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patients.

So-called patient self-inflicted lung injury is a controversial concept in the intensive care community, with some clinicians insisting there is no evidence for its existence, while others argue that patients should, if necessary, be placed on mechanical ventilators to avoid it.

There is an ongoing debate about the potential for increased respiratory efforts to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, however direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce.

In the paper, 'High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study', published in the journal Annals of Intensive Care, researchers from the University of Warwick have adapted a computational simulator of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury, at different levels of respiratory effort.

The simulator was set up to represent a population of 10 COVID-19 patients, being treated with supplemental oxygen.

For each of these patients, simulations across a range of tidal volumes (depth of breathing) and respiratory rates were tested, from a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (representing normal breathing), up to a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (representing high respiratory effort).

The results of the simulations indicated that potentially injurious pressures and strains could be generated at levels of respiratory effort that clinicians are frequently seeing in COVID-19 patients.

Professor Declan Bates, from the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick comments:

""Our modelling has found that patients who experience COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure may be at significant risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury due to increased respiratory efforts. These efforts need to be carefully monitored and controlled during their care.""

""Patients should always follow the advice of their clinicians regarding timing of initiation of oxygen support, non-invasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation.""",0
61,"Most people in the U.S. consume too much salt; adult Americans typically eat twice the daily amount recommended by dietary guidelines. Bread may not seem like an obvious culprit; however, due to high consumption and relatively high salt content, baked goods are a major source of sodium in the diet. A new study from the University of Illinois explores ways to reduce sodium in bread without sacrificing taste and leavening ability.

""Bread is one of the staple foods in a lot of people's diets, and people generally don't stick to just one serving of bread,"" says Aubrey Dunteman, graduate student in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at U of I, and lead author on the paper.

""About 70% of sodium in the U.S. food supply comes from packaged and processed foods. And the top source is actually baked goods, so reducing salt in that particular category would help to reduce sodium consumption tremendously,"" adds study co-author Soo-Yeun Lee, professor of food science at U of I.

We can't completely eliminate salt from our diet, but we can reduce it to a healthier level.

""Salt is an essential nutrient, and this is why we crave it. However, we consume more than we should, just like sugar and fat. Salt is related with hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, but it's the amount that is the problem, not the salt itself,"" Lee notes.

Salt is also an essential ingredient in bread making; it contributes to the structure and flavor of the bread, and is necessary for the yeast to work properly.

Dunteman and Lee conducted an extensive review of academic literature on sodium reduction in bread. They identified four main categories: Salt reduction without any further mitigation, physical modification, sodium replacements, and flavor enhancers. They discuss each of these methods in their paper, published in the International Journal of Food Science and Technology.

""The most basic method is just reducing the amount of salt in the product,"" Dunteman says. ""That can be good to a point, depending on the original level of salt and equivalent in the recipe. There's always going to be a minimum amount of salt you need just to have the bread function and the yeast do its job. So it's a limited method, but it can help to reduce high levels of sodium intake.""

Another method is physical modification, which involves uneven distribution of salt in the product.

""Sensory adaptation occurs when you have constant stimulus. If the salt is evenly distributed in a slice of bread, as you take more bites, it's going to taste less salty, because you're already adapted to the first few bites. But if you have different distribution of salt, alternating between densely and lightly salted layers, people will perceive it as more salty. So you can obtain the same taste effect with less salt,"" Lee explains.

A third method involves replacement of sodium with other substances, such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or potassium chloride. ""This is one of the most commonly used methods in industry, but it can only be used up to a certain point, before you get a bit of a metallic taste from these compounds,"" Dunteman points out.

The fourth method involves flavor modification with taste enhancers such as herbs and spices, or even monosodium glutamate (MSG). The researchers note multi-grain bread also allows for more salt reduction than white bread, because it has more flavor on its own.

Dunteman and Lee conclude the best approach to sodium reduction in bread will be a combination of methods.

""One of the four categories, salt reduction, is technically involved in all of them,"" Dunteman notes. ""Another category, salt replacement, is already heavily studied. We recommend more research into physical modification methods, as well as flavor enhancement types, and how to combine each of these methods with salt reduction.""

Finally, the researchers have some advice for home bakers looking to reduce sodium in their creations.

""If you're interested in using less salt in your home-baked bread, you could try to reduce the amount to 50%, if you're using standard recipes that are widely available,"" Lee says. ""You'd be surprised that the dough would still rise, though the bread would taste a little different. You can also use flavor enhancers to provide the salty, savory, satiating sensation you lose when you reduce the salt. But that wouldn't help with the rise, so you cannot remove salt 100%.""",0

68,"The National Institutes of Health announced the launch of a new initiative to help speed the development of cures for sickle cell disease, a group of inherited blood disorders affecting at least 100,000 people in the United States and 20 million worldwide. The Cure Sickle Cell Initiative will take advantage of the latest genetic discoveries and technological advances to move the most promising genetic-based curative therapies safely into clinical trials within five to 10 years.

“Our scientific investments have brought us to a point where we have many tools available to correct or compensate for the defective gene that causes sickle cell disease. We are now ready to use these tools to speed up our quest for a cure,” said Gary H. Gibbons, M.D., director of NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), which is leading the effort.

Sickle cell disease results from a single genetic mutation that causes a person’s red blood cells to form an abnormal, sickle shape. These sickled cells can clog the blood vessels and deprive cells of oxygen. In turn, this lack of oxygen wreaks havoc on the body, damaging organs, causing severe pain, and potentially leading to premature death.

Decades of basic research on sickle cell disease have laid the groundwork for novel genetic approaches to cures, such as the genetic editing of bone marrow cells, which have shown great promise in animal models and in some small scale human studies. In addition, the NHLBI Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) program has been working with researchers to manufacture cellular therapeutic products, including genetically modified cells, that can be used safely in clinical trials with patients.

NIH spends approximately $100 million on sickle cell disease research each year. Through this initiative, NHLBI seeks to support the development of cell and genetic therapies resources, clinical trials, comparator analyses of different management strategies, data repositories and resources, and patient and advocate engagement activities related to curative therapies for this condition. Already in 2018, NHLBI committed an additional $7 million to jumpstart the initiative’s research and engagement infrastructure.

NHLBI has named hematologist Edward J. Benz Jr., M.D., President and CEO Emeritus of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as the Initiative’s executive director, and the Emmes Corporation, a contract research organization with specialized expertise in clinical trials, gene and cell therapy development in preclinical studies, as its coordinating center.

The initiative and its research partners will establish a national data warehouse of genetic therapies for sickle cell disease and conduct comparative analyses of therapeutic approaches to assess both clinical and cost effectiveness. They will also establish national networks to make it easier for patients and providers to learn and engage with the research, clinical trials, and other activities happening across the country.

“The engagement of patients will be a cornerstone of this effort,” said Benz. “Patients will work alongside researchers in developing and recruiting for clinical trials.”

Currently, the only cure for sickle cell disease is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure in which a sick patient receives bone marrow from a healthy, genetically-compatible sibling donor. However, transplants are too risky for many adults, and only about 18 percent of children with sickle cell disease have a healthy, matched sibling donor.

The Cure Sickle Cell Initiative seeks to develop cures for a far broader group of individuals with the disease, and it is initially focusing on gene therapies that modify the patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which make red and other blood cells. These modified HSCs can then be given back to the patient via a bone marrow transplant, making a cure available to more patients who lack a matched donor.

“This initiative is giving patients, families, and communities a reason for hope. I’m particularly pleased that we are able to make this announcement during Sickle Cell Awareness month, when we are shining a spotlight on the toll of this devastating disease,” said ADM Brett Giroir, M.D. Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

This patient-focused Initiative builds on the legacy of NHLBI-supported research that has contributed to improving clinical care for patients who have sickle cell disease. It also complements the Institute’s broader sickle cell disease research investment, which includes basic, clinical, translational, and implementation science research.

Part of the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders.

69,"A fault in cells that form a key part of the immune system can be repaired with a pioneering gene editing technique, finds new research demonstrated in human cells and mice, led by UCL scientists.

Researchers say the study, published in Science Translational Medicine, could lead to new treatments for a rare disease of the white blood cells that normally help to control the immune system -- known as regulatory T cells -- and those that protect the body from repeat infections and cancer -- known as effector T cells.

Patients with the condition, known as CTLA-4 insufficiency, carry mutations in a gene that cause these T cells to function abnormally. It leads them to suffer from severe autoimmunity, where their immune system attacks their own tissues and organs, including their blood cells.

The condition also hampers their immune system's 'memory', meaning patients can struggle to fight off recurring infections by the same viruses and bacteria. In some cases, it can also lead to lymphomas, a type of blood cancer.

In human cells, using 'cut' and 'paste' gene editing techniques, using the CRISPR/Cas system, the researchers were able to target the faulty gene in T cells taken from patients with CTLA-4 insufficiency and repair the errors. This restored the levels of CTLA-4 in the cells to those seen in healthy T cells. They were also able to improve symptoms of the disease in mice with CTLA-4 insufficiency by giving them injections of gene edited (corrected) T cells.

Co-senior author, Professor Claire Booth, Mahboubian Professor of gene therapy and paediatric immunology at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said: ""It's really exciting to think about taking this treatment forward to patients. If we can improve their symptoms and reduce their risk of getting lymphoproliferative disease this will be a major step forward. This particular paper is important because we are using the newest gene editing techniques to precisely correct these T cells, which is a new approach in inborn errors of immunity.""

CTLA-4 is a protein produced by T cells that helps to control the activity of the immune system. Most people carry two working copies of the gene responsible for producing CTLA-4, but those who have only one functional copy produce too little of the protein to sufficiently regulate the immune system.

Currently, the standard treatment for CTLA-4 insufficiency is a bone marrow transplant to replace the stem cells responsible for producing T cells. But transplants are risky and require high doses of chemotherapy and many weeks in hospital. Older patients with CTLA-4 insufficiency are typically not well enough to tolerate the transplant procedure.

Professor Booth said: ""Our approach has many positive aspects. By correcting the patient's T cells, we think it can improve many of the symptoms of the disease, at the same time as being much less toxic than a bone marrow transplant. Collecting the T cells is easier and, correcting the T cells is easier. With this approach the amount of time in hospital the patients would need would be far less.""

The gene editing approach, developed by the UCL researchers, uses the Nobel-prize winning gene editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 to target and snip the faulty CTLA-4 gene in two. Then a corrected sequence of DNA is delivered to the cell using a modified virus. This is then pasted over the faulty part of the gene using a cellular DNA repair mechanism known as homology-directed repair.

This allowed the researchers to preserve important sequences within the CTLA-4 gene -- known as the intron -- that allow it to be switched on and off by the cell only when needed.

Co-senior author, Professor Emma Morris, a professor of clinical cell and gene therapy and Director of UCL's Division of Infection and Immunity, said: ""Genes that play critical roles in controlling immune responses are not switched on all the time and are very tightly regulated. The technique we have used allows us to leave the natural (endogenous) mechanisms controlling gene expression intact, at the same time as correcting the mistake in the gene itself.""

The study was led by Dr Thomas Fox, a Wellcome Trust Clinical PhD Fellow at UCL, and built on work by Dr Pietro Genovese at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorder Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who is one of the authors on the study.

Although CTLA-4 insufficiency is rare, the research team say the gene editing therapy they have developed for tackling the disease could be a proof of principle of their approach that could be adapted to tackle other conditions.

Professor Morris added: ""It's a way of correcting genetic mutations that could potentially be applicable for other diseases. The bigger picture is it allows us to correct genes that are dysregulated or overactive, but also allows us to understand much more about gene expression and gene regulation.""",0
72,"Experts say it’s the total calories you consume per day that matter the most. Cavan Images/Getty Images
• Researchers compared weight-loss diets that included either a large breakfast or a large dinner.
• Both types of diets led to similar weight loss and metabolic reactions.
• Those who had a larger breakfast felt fuller throughout the day, possibly making it easier to maintain the diet for longer. Should you eat your biggest meal in the morning or in the evening? Some researchers are saying it doesn’t make a lot of difference — as long as you consume the same number of calories throughout the day. In a study published today in the journal Cell Metabolism, European researchers tested two types of weight-loss diets against each other. Both diets included the same total number of calories each day. But one diet had participants consume most of these calories in the morning, while the second had most of the calories in the evening. The result? Both diets performed about the same in terms of weight loss. The group who ate the larger morning meal, however, was significantly less hungry throughout the day.

A look at the science In this study, 30 people, 16 men and 14 women, were recruited to participate, all of whom were either overweight or had obesity but were otherwise healthy. No participants had diabetes, a condition that could significantly alter the results in a study of this size. This was a real-world study, not restricted to a lab setting, with participants under observation for four weeks. Each individual had a fixed daily calorie intake, but some had a larger morning meal while others had a larger evening meal. How large is large? 45% of their daily calorie intake. Lunches for both groups made up 35% of their calories while their smaller meal was 20%. All participants got about 30% of their calories from proteins and 35% each from carbohydrates and fats. At the end of the study, the weight-loss results for each group were comparable. However, the group that had larger morning meals showed a decrease in ghrelin — a hormone that makes you feel hungry — during the day, while they also had an increase in hormones that make you feel full. These participants also had slower gastric emptying, which means that their food spent more time in their stomachs before entering the rest of the digestive tract. Researchers said this was an important finding because previous studies have suggested that front-loading your calories in the morning leads to enhanced weight loss.

Emily Feivor, RD, a registered dietitian at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills in Queens, part of Northwell Health in New York, told Healthline she wasn’t surprised by these results. “The idea of keeping hunger in check with balanced meals at structured mealtimes may be a significant help in achieving appropriate portion sizes and intakes throughout the day, which is the most effective and simplest diet ‘secret’,” Feivor said. Lori Welstead, MS, RD, LDN, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at the Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at UChicago Medicine, told Healthline, “It is a challenge to study nutrition and metabolism in human subjects. We are not as simple as mouse models or as it may seem in the lab.” “This was the first study of its kind and helps to build insight to provide the groundwork for more studies,” Welstead added. She noted that the researchers admittedly couldn’t measure things such as glucose in the group that ate larger evening meals because the participants had to go to sleep. Megan Wroe, MS, RD, CNE, CLEC, a wellness manager and registered dietitian for the Wellness Center at Providence St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, told Healthline she agreed that this study led to interesting questions for future research. “I would love to see the authors take this study further now and assess outcomes of breakfast meals with various macronutrient composition. A high fat vs. high protein vs. high carb breakfast may instigate very different outcomes,” Wroe said.

From the lab to the lunch table It’s one thing to study weight-loss diets. It’s another to be on one. While having a larger breakfast may make it easier to maintain a specific diet, it’s important to remember that in this study total daily calories were strictly controlled. Experts say having a large breakfast without making any other lifestyle changes is unlikely to have a significant positive effect on your health. “Breakfast should include the basic building blocks: high fiber from fruits/vegetables or whole grains plus a good amount of protein and some heart-healthy fats,” said Feivor. “Beware of breakfast traps of high sugar/low fiber cereals, fruit juices (even 100%), pastries, and highly processed meats,” she warned. “Listen to your body. If you are hungry then eat. If you are full then stop. It takes about 20 minutes to really notice that signal,” said Welstead. “Many diets for weight loss are not geared toward sustainable lifestyle changes and are quick fixes. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is,” Welstead added. The importance of physical activity can’t be ignored either. “Improved heart rate, increased energy, and mood, reduced levels of stress, increased muscle tone, reduced visceral fat, and improved metabolic markers such as blood sugar and blood pressure are all common potential benefits of increased physical activity even if there is no weight loss associated with it,” said Wroe. “Weight-loss diets almost never create sustained loss if there is no change in how the person eats. There is only so far calorie restriction can go, independent of when those calories are allotted into the day,” she added.",0
73,"PHOENIX – Mayo Clinic researchers have found that an experimental drug, LCL161, stimulates the immune system, leading to tumor shrinkage in patients affected by multiple myeloma. The findings are published in Nature Medicine.

Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects plasma cells – white blood cells that normally produce antibodies to fight infection. Rather than produce helpful antibodies, the cancer cells, as they grow, secrete large amounts of a single antibody that accumulate in the body, causing kidney problems and infections.

“The drug, LCL161, was initially developed to promote tumor death,” says Marta Chesi, Ph.D , a Mayo Clinic biochemist and lead author of the study of 25 Multiple Myeloma patients. “However, we found that the drug does not kill tumor cells directly. Rather, it makes them more visible to the immune system that recognizes them as foreigner invaders and eliminates them.”

Mayo Clinic researchers will conduct a follow-up clinical trial of LCL161 in combination with an inhibitor of immune checkpoints that has been widely used in many cancer treatments to evaluate if LCL161 could represent a potential new treatment option.

“The model for preclinical studies to predict with great accuracy which drugs would work in the clinic was developed a decade ago,” says Dr. Chesi. “And it has been instrumental in the prioritization of which experimental therapeutics should be tested in patients with multiple myeloma.”

The research highlights the importance of studying the effects of drugs not only on the tumor cells in a culture plate, but also on the interaction of the tumor cells with their own microenvironment. The finding that LCL161 is active against multiple myeloma suggests that similar drugs may have broader clinical activity than previously thought.

The work of Dr. Chesi and her team reflects Mayo Clinic’s focus to bridge basic science discoveries into clinical trials through collaboration, beginning with unmet patient needs.

75,"Bacteria's role in gut health has received a lot of attention in recent years. But new research led by scientists at University of Utah Health shows that fungi -- another microorganism that lives within us -- may be equally important in health and disease.

Fungi thrive in the healthy gut, but they can also cause intestinal damage that may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), according to the study published in Nature on July 14. Experiments with mice show that normally, the immune system keeps fungi in check, targeting the microbe when it switches into a state that can cause harm. When the system is off-balance, disease is more likely to occur.

""Fungi have been wholly understudied in part because they are vastly outnumbered by bacteria,"" says June Round, Ph.D., professor of pathology at U of U Health and the study's senior author. New tools and technologies are starting to make investigations like this one possible, she adds. ""This work adds an important piece to the bigger picture.""

These insights open new avenues for developing therapeutics to improve gut health. The study shows proof of concept that, one day, vaccines could be used to curb gastrointestinal disease by enhancing natural immune responses that encourage a healthy balance of fungi and other gut microbiota.

Round became interested in this line of research after noting that a common medical test for diagnosing Crohn's disease, a type of IBD, works by detecting antibodies against fungi. And yet, how antibodies affect fungi's influence on disease had yet to be explored.

To dig deeper, her team searched for the trigger of the immune response. Working with patient samples and carrying out tests with mice, they determined that the yeast Candida albicans -- one of the main species of fungi that reside in the human gut -- elicited the strongest immune response. Further investigation showed that antibodies zeroed in on elongated fungal cell types called hyphae, specifically binding to proteins called adhesins that help microbes stick to surfaces and become invasive.

With this target in hand, the researchers could more definitively probe the fungi's role in gut health. They found that mice populated with the yeast in its normal, rounded state remained healthy. In contrast, mice populated with Candida in its invasive form caused intestinal damage that resembled IBD. The results show that normal antibody responses in the gut inhibit disease by recognizing the harmful, hyphal form of fungi.

IBD isn't the only health condition associated with fungi. Another is vaginal yeast infections. The researchers determined that a vaccine being investigated as a remedy for yeast infection triggered an immune reaction against adhesin proteins that is similar to the reaction in Crohn's patients. When inoculated with the vaccine, mice normally prone to an IBD-like condition were less likely to develop disease.

The researchers are now investigating whether vaccines could help mitigate IBD in people -- and whether the same approach can be applied more broadly to shape other microbial communities in the gut. ""We aim to exploit interactions with commensal microbes and the host immune system to harness microbial products for therapies,"" Round says.

In addition to implications for disease, the findings also suggest fungi may be important in the healthy gut. Typically, the immune system's job is to clear infections by getting rid of invasive organisms. In this case, fungi benefit from their interaction with antibodies. The immune reaction prods fungi from their invasive state into their rounded, budding state, which improves their survival in the gut.

""The immune system is constraining Candida to its least pathogenic form,"" says Kyla Ost, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in Round's lab and the study's lead author. ""This is showing us that the communication between host and microbe can be friendly, as opposed to antagonistic, in order to benefit both.""",0

78,"Small-scale trial is the first randomized, controlled research of its kind.

People eating ultra-processed foods ate more calories and gained more weight than when they ate a minimally processed diet, according to results from a National Institutes of Health study. The difference occurred even though meals provided to the volunteers in both the ultra-processed and minimally processed diets had the same number of calories and macronutrients. The results were published in Cell Metabolism.

This small-scale study of 20 adult volunteers, conducted by researchers at the NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), is the first randomized controlled trial examining the effects of ultra-processed foods as defined by the NOVA classification system. This system considers foods “ultra-processed” if they have ingredients predominantly found in industrial food manufacturing, such as hydrogenated oils, high-fructose corn syrup, flavoring agents, and emulsifiers.

Previous observational studies looking at large groups of people had shown associations between diets high in processed foods and health problems. But, because none of the past studies randomly assigned people to eat specific foods and then measured the results, scientists could not say for sure whether the processed foods were a problem on their own, or whether people eating them had health problems for other reasons, such as a lack of access to fresh foods.

“Though we examined a small group, results from this tightly controlled experiment showed a clear and consistent difference between the two diets,” said Kevin D. Hall, Ph.D., an NIDDK senior investigator and the study’s lead author. “This is the first study to demonstrate causality — that ultra-processed foods cause people to eat too many calories and gain weight.”

For the study, researchers admitted 20 healthy adult volunteers, 10 male and 10 female, to the NIH Clinical Center for one continuous month and, in random order for two weeks on each diet, provided them with meals made up of ultra-processed foods or meals of minimally processed foods. For example, an ultra-processed breakfast might consist of a bagel with cream cheese and turkey bacon, while the unprocessed breakfast was oatmeal with bananas, walnuts, and skim milk.

The ultra-processed and unprocessed meals had the same amounts of calories, sugars, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates, and participants could eat as much or as little as they wanted.

On the ultra-processed diet, people ate about 500 calories more per day than they did on the unprocessed diet. They also ate faster on the ultra-processed diet and gained weight, whereas they lost weight on the unprocessed diet. Participants, on average, gained 0.9 kilograms, or 2 pounds, while they were on the ultra-processed diet and lost an equivalent amount on the unprocessed diet.

“We need to figure out what specific aspect of the ultra-processed foods affected people’s eating behavior and led them to gain weight,” Hall said. “The next step is to design similar studies with a reformulated ultra-processed diet to see if the changes can make the diet effect on calorie intake and body weight disappear.”

For example, slight differences in protein levels between the ultra-processed and unprocessed diets in this study could potentially explain as much as half the difference in calorie intake.

“Over time, extra calories add up, and that extra weight can lead to serious health conditions,” said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D. “Research like this is an important part of understanding the role of nutrition in health and may also help people identify foods that are both nutritious and accessible — helping people stay healthy for the long term.”

While the study reinforces the benefits of unprocessed foods, researchers note that ultra-processed foods can be difficult to restrict. “We have to be mindful that it takes more time and more money to prepare less-processed foods,” Hall said. “Just telling people to eat healthier may not be effective for some people without improved access to healthy foods.”

81,"Aedes aegypti are the primary vector for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever. However, the effects of climate change-related weather anomalies on mosquito populations is not well understood. A study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases by Cameron Nosrat at Stanford University, United States and colleagues suggests that early interventions may prevent disease transmission even as extreme climate events may increase the abundance of Ae. aegypti populations.

Temperature and rainfall have significant impacts on Ae. aegypti abundance, and climate change will likely intensify the frequency of extreme climate events such as floods, droughts, heat waves and cold waves. To better understand the specific effects of weather anomalies on the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission, researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of dengue infections in Kenya. Using satellite-derived climate data, the authors classified extreme climate events rainfall and temperatures as in the upper or lower 10% of historical averages. The researchers then monitored Aedes aegypti abundance using trapping methods and new dengue fever cases via blood samples collected from a cohort of 7,653 children.

Flood seasons contributed to significantly higher Ae. aegypti egg and adult abundance. However, extreme climate events and greater Ae. aegypti abundance did not correlate to an increased number of confirmed dengue fever cases. Human behaviors can modify the relationship between mosquito abundance and disease transmission, and influence infection risk. Preventative measures in the study sites may have contributed to reductions in dengue transmission. A major limitation of the study was the lack of long-term Kenya climate data; however, the authors believe their study effectively examines the influence of weather anomalies on various life stages of Ae. aegypti abundance.

According to the authors, ""Dengue is the fastest-growing mosquito-borne disease in the world, and as climate change accelerates, many vulnerable populations will continue to be disproportionately impacted by this virus. Having shown floods to result in significantly increased dengue vector abundance, we hope to encourage actionable interventions to limit infection risk in light of these extreme climate events.""",0
82,"Previously unrecognized pathways in mice have relevance for mental health and addiction research.

Researchers have identified connections between neurons in brain systems associated with reward, stress, and emotion. Conducted in mice, the new study may help untangle multiple psychiatric conditions, including alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and depression in humans.

“Understanding these intricate brain systems will be critical for developing diagnostic and therapeutic tools for a broad array of conditions,” said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), which contributed funding for the study. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) also provided major support for the research. NIAAA and NIMH are parts of the National Institutes of Health.

A report of the study, by first author Dr. William Giardino and colleagues at Stanford University, appears in the August 2018 issue of Nature Neuroscience.

Responding appropriately to aversive or rewarding stimuli is essential for survival. This requires fine-tuned regulation of brain systems that enable rapid responses to changes in the environment, such as those involved in sleep, wakefulness, stress, and reward-seeking. These same brain systems are often dysregulated in addiction and other psychiatric conditions.

In the new study, researchers looked at the extended amygdala, a brain region involved in fear, arousal, and emotional processing and which plays a significant role in drug and alcohol addiction. They focused on a part of this structure known as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), which connects the extended amygdala to the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates sleep, appetite, and body temperature.

The hypothalamus is also thought to promote both negative and positive emotional states. A better understanding of how the BNST and hypothalamus work to coordinate emotion-related behavior could shed light on the emotional processes dysregulated in addiction.

“These circuits, also implicated in binge drinking, are likely to be elements in understanding the detailed mechanisms driving stress-related alcohol- or drug-seeking and consummatory behaviors,” said first author Dr. Giardino.

To map the brain circuitry between the BNST and the hypothalamus, Dr. Giardino and his colleagues exposed mice to rewarding and aversive stimuli, and then visualized and manipulated the activity of neurons using fiber optic techniques.

The scientists identified two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the BNST that connect to separate populations of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These parallel circuits drove opposing emotional states: avoidance (aversion) and approach (preference). Different neurotransmitters were linked to aversion and preference within these neurocircuits – corticotropin releasing factor was involved in aversion, while cholecystokinin played a role in preference.

“The discovery of the unique and opposing influences of these specific BNST to LH circuits may be broadly relevant to the fields of neuroscience and mental health,” said senior author Luis de Lecea, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.

The authors note that future studies of the BNST to LH pathways will inform the development of improved therapeutic approaches for psychiatric disorders.

83,"July 28, 2022 -- As the school year is set to begin across the country, CNN reports that most children and teenagers are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and cases are rising again with the highly transmissible BA.5 variant.

Public schools in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and other large cities are scheduled to re-open next month.

In the past four weeks, 311,000 kids have tested positive for COVID-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported. Since the pandemic began, more than 14 million children have tested positive.

A CNN analysis reported that less than half of children and teenagers are fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated means it has been at least two weeks since receiving the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Only a tenth of these age groups have received booster shots.

Children over 6 months old can be vaccinated. Those 5 years and older are eligible for a booster.

The CDC’s most recent data shows that about 24 million kids ages 5 to 17 are fully vaccinated, or about 45% of them. About 22 million are eligible for a booster, but only about 5 million have received one.",0
84,"May 3, 2023 – A new study shows that one dose of a vaccine that can prevent the virus that leads to most cases of cervical cancer may be as effective as the usual two or three doses.

The findings could have a significant impact on cutting the rate of cervical cancer worldwide, because a single dose would simplify the vaccination process and cost less. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer among women, killing an estimated 342,000 worldwide in 2020.

The vaccine prevents transmission of cancer-causing strains of the sexually transmitted disease called human papillomavirus, or HPV. The first HPV vaccine was approved in the U.S. in 2006, and the CDC currently recommends two or three doses, depending on a person’s age.

The new findings were presented at the end of April during the 35th International Papillomavirus Conference in Washington, DC. The study included 2,275 people in Kenya who ranged in age from 15 to 20 years old. They were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: a single-dose vaccine that targets two HPV strains, a single-dose HPV vaccine that targets nine strains, or a control vaccine. Participants were regularly tested for 3 years. The two-strain vaccine was 98% effective, and the nine-strain vaccine was 96% effective, the researchers reported.",0
86,"A global study into mucinous ovarian cancer could help oncologists recommend the best treatment for women who are diagnosed early with the condition.

By looking down a microscope for two different 'patterns of invasion' -- the way that cancer cells invade ovarian tissue -- oncologists can better predict which patients may have better or worse prognoses and can target treatment accordingly. The finding was reported in a paper published today in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

""Mucinous ovarian cancer is a rare type of ovarian cancer. It actually has more in common with gastrointestinal cancers, and can be hard to diagnose and hard to treat once it has spread beyond the ovaries,"" says lead author Nicki Meagher, who has just completed her PhD in the Molecular Oncology group, UNSW School of Clinical Medicine.

She says that observing which of the two types of invasion patterns that the cancer cells form could help specialists decide on treatment strategies.

""We've shown for the first time that women who have early-stage disease -- meaning they have tumours that haven't spread beyond the ovary -- have much poorer survival chances in the first two years from diagnosis if they have what we call an infiltrative pattern of invasion.

""Knowing this in the early stage of the disease means we can identify patients who could benefit from additional chemotherapy following surgery to remove their ovaries.""

The two patterns of invasion are defined by the way the cancer cells organise themselves when viewed under a microscope. The infiltrative pattern of invasion associated with poorer health outcomes shows cancer cells spreading in an uneven, haphazard way through the ovarian tissue. The other pattern is known as expansile, where cells expand through tissue in a more orderly manner, and is associated with better prognoses.

Up until now, other studies had suggested that the infiltrative pattern of invasion was associated with poorer patient outcomes, but no study had large enough numbers of patients with early-stage cancer to reach statistical significance.

But the current study, that involved more than 100 researchers in Australia, UK, Canada, Asia, Europe and the US, was able to test this hypothesis in much larger numbers by examining the tissue of 604 patients. The researchers also looked for the expression of 19 genes including THBS2 and TAGLN in addition to the patterns of invasion.

Professor Susan Ramus who oversaw the global study and heads the Ovarian Tumour Tissue Analysis consortium says that guidelines on how to treat women with early-stage mucinous ovarian cancer have differed around the world due to limited data on infiltrative patterns of invasion associated with survival rates.

""For example, in some parts of the world, an infiltrative pattern was acknowledged as an important feature and determined what treatment those women receive,"" Professor Ramus says.

""Whereas in others, all patients are recommended for the same pathway of treatment. We hope that after this large study treatment guidelines can be aligned and that we can target treatment for women who may have these more serious indicators, even if they are diagnosed in early stages.""

The researchers also noted that women with higher expression of two genes, THBS2 and TAGLN in their tumours, had poorer overall survival.

""We're hoping that this may be able to help explain some of the biology potentially down the track,"" says Ms Meagher.

""Another avenue could be that knowledge of expression of these genes could assist in developing targeted drugs.""

The researchers are part of a wide network of experts who plan to carry out a validation study to further investigate these genomic markers as the basis for a targeted treatment strategy.",0

98,"A diet containing lots of salt can contribute to increased levels of stress, a new study shows.

Scientists found in studies of mice that a high-salt diet increased the levels of a stress hormone by 75 per cent.

Experts hope the findings will encourage a review of public health policy around salt consumption, with a view to manufacturers reducing the amount of salt in processed food.

The recommended salt intake for adults is less than six grams a day but most people regularly eat about nine grams.

This can contribute to higher blood pressure, which increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and vascular dementia.

While effects on the heart and circulatory system have been well established, little was known about the impact of a high-salt diet on a person's behaviour.

To study this, experts from the University of Edinburgh used mice, who ordinarily have a low-salt diet, and gave them high-salt food to reflect the typical intake of humans.

They found that not only did resting stress hormone levels increase, but the mice's hormone response to environmental stress was double that of mice that had a normal diet.

Salt intake increased the activity of genes that produce the proteins in the brain which control how the body responds to stress.

Experts say further studies are already underway to understand if a high-salt intake leads to other behavioural changes such as anxiety and aggression.

The study is published in Cardiovascular Research. It was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Kidney Research UK.

Matthew Bailey, Professor of Renal Physiology at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Cardiovascular Science, said: ""We are what we eat and understanding how high-salt food changes our mental health is an important step to improving wellbeing. We know that eating too much salt damages our heart, blood vessels and kidneys. This study now tells us that high salt in our food also changes the way our brain handles stress.""",0
104,"Alphaviruses -- mosquito-borne viruses that can trigger brain infections and arthritis -- may have met their match.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified two antibodies that protect animals from disease caused by alphaviruses. The antibodies worked for every alphavirus tested, meaning they potentially could form the basis of treatments or serve as a template for a universal vaccine.

The findings are published Aug. 19 in the journal Cell.

""In the U.S., the alphavirus we worry most about is chikungunya virus, which can cause debilitating arthritis, but we also do see cases of encephalitis caused by Eastern equine encephalitis virus,"" said senior author Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine and a professor of molecular microbiology and of pathology & immunology. ""Alphaviruses used to be limited to the tropics, but in recent years they've been spreading into new geographic areas. Most are still uncommon, but together they cause millions of infections and a considerable burden of disease, and we don't have specific therapies or vaccines for any of them.""

The alphavirus group includes more than 30 species, split into two branches. Viruses such as chikungunya, Mayaro, O'nyong-nyong and Ross River, all of which cause fever, rash and arthritis, historically had been limited to Africa, Asia and Europe. However, beginning in 2013, chikungunya worked its way into the Caribbean and parts of North and South America. The other branch of alphaviruses, found in the Americas, includes Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses and causes brain infections.

Diamond and colleagues previously identified a group of antibodies that neutralize many members of the arthritis-causing branch of the alphavirus group. But those antibodies didn't work against all of the viruses that cause arthritis and failed entirely against the ones that cause brain infections.

To find antibodies that would protect against the whole alphavirus group, Diamond and colleagues -- including co-first authors Arthur S. Kim, PhD, then a graduate student, and Natasha M. Kafai, an MD/PhD student -- screened a set of antibodies produced by two people who had been infected with chikungunya virus. They tested the antibodies against a panel of alphaviruses representing both branches of the group. Two antibodies recognized all of the alphaviruses tested.

Then, they assessed whether the antibodies could prevent arthritis or brain infection in animals. Using mice, they tested each antibody against two alphaviruses that cause arthritis and three that cause brain infections. Both antibodies protected the animals against all of the viruses.

Further experiments showed that the antibodies worked by blocking developing virus particles from exiting one cell en route to infecting another. The antibodies attach to part of a viral protein called E1 that is exposed only during the exiting process. Once the virus has fully formed and detached from the cell, the E1 protein is folded into the virus particle and hidden.

In a related paper being published in the same issue of Cell, James E. Crowe, MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, also reports that antibodies targeting the E1 protein bind to a wide range of alphaviruses, prevent them from exiting cells and protect animals against both arthritis and brain infections. Crowe and Diamond are longtime collaborators, and each contributed to the other's paper.

The two studies start from different points -- Diamond began with a virus that causes arthritis; Crowe started with one that causes brain infections -- but arrive at basically the same conclusion: The E1 protein could be the key to universal protection against alphaviruses.

""If we could figure out how to make a vaccine that targets the E1 protein effectively, it would be a cost-effective way to provide broad protection for people in resource-limited places, which is where most alphavirus infections occur,"" Diamond said. ""It's challenging to make such a vaccine since the target is hidden most of the time. But there are techniques that can be used to make the immune system focus on E1 and generate a good antibody response against it. That's the next step toward creating a universal vaccine.""",0
111,"Finding in zebrafish may contribute to understanding cognitive decline of aging.

National Institutes of Health researchers studying zebrafish have determined that a population of cells that protect the brain against diseases and harmful substances are not immune cells, as had previously been thought, but instead likely arise from the lining of the circulatory system.

This basic science finding may have implications for understanding age-related decline in brain functioning and how HIV infects brain cells.

The study, appearing online in eLife, was conducted by researchers at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and National Human Genome Research Institute and the Japanese National Institute of Genetics.

The blood-brain barrier is the layer of cells that line the blood vessels of the brain. The inner cell layer that lines vessels, known as the endothelium, is present in all the blood vessels of the body. Within the blood vessels of the brain, endothelial cells and other adjacent cells form a tight barrier that helps to prevent toxins and microbes from entering the brain. Although their function is not completely understood, a special population of cells covering the blood vessels on the brain’s surface is thought to contribute to the organ’s protection. The cells act as sentries, engulfing toxins, cellular wastes and microbes and then encasing them in sphere-like structures called vesicles. These sentry cells are called fluorescent granular perithelial cells (FGPs) because the vesicles they contain give off a yellow glow in the presence of light.

In the current study, the researchers showed that FGPs are present on the surface of the zebrafish brain and that these blood vessel-associated FGPs do not arise from the immune system, as had been previously thought, but from endothelial cells themselves.

FGPs are thought to be important in a variety of human brain disorders and conditions. These cells appear to be a major entry point for HIV infection of the brain. Age-related decline in cognitive function is associated with a decline in the scavenging function of FGPs. “Learning more about how FGPs function may lead to a greater understanding of dementia and other conditions,” said the study’s senior author, Brant Weinstein, Ph.D., of NICHD’s Section on Vertebrate Organogenesis.

The Weinstein lab studies zebrafish to understand how the blood and lymphatic systems develop. Because the young fish are transparent, it is possible to see the developing circulatory system while observing the fish under a light microscope. As part of this effort, Dr. Weinstein and his colleagues inserted a gene for a protein that turns green into the cells that line the endothelium of selected embryonic veins and in the lymphatic system — the network of vessels through which immune cells travel in the body. In addition to seeing green lymphatic cells in the zebrafish embryos, the researchers noticed that green cells also covered the surface of the tiny fish’s brains.

Upon closer inspection, the researchers tentatively identified these cells as FGPs. Because they turned green, it was apparent that they arose from endothelial cells. Until the current study, FGPs were thought to be macrophages, a type of immune cell. The researchers conducted additional experiments to confirm the origins of the FGPs, including analyzing what proteins were being made by their DNA. These proteins most closely resembled those made by endothelial cells in the lymphatic system, not the proteins made by macrophages or other immune cells. In another series of experiments, they inserted a green fluorescent protein into the tissues that give rise to blood and lymph vessels in embryonic zebrafish. Using time lapse photography, the researchers captured images of FGPs arising from the vessels’ endothelium. When zebrafish with the green fluorescing endothelial gene matured, the researchers observed green FGPs on the surface of the fish’s brains — confirming that these cells arose from endothelial tissue.

The researchers hope to conduct further studies of how FGPs interact with blood vessels and the blood-brain barrier. The researchers noted that, unlike mammals, embryonic zebrafish can be observed under a microscope as they develop, providing an easy means for studying the role of FGPs in protecting the brain.

113,"July 27, 2022 -- About 1 million people are on lockdown again in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 virus was first found, according to Bloomberg and other news reports.

The city of 12 million became the world’s first to face restrictive measures back in early 2020. China still maintains its “zero COVID” policies, which require testing, social isolation and more frequent lockdowns.

Now, after four people were found to have asymptomatic COVID-19, residents in the Jiangxia district must stay inside for three days. The government has stopped all public transportation, and entertainment venues must be closed for three days, Bloomberg says. The first two cases were found during normal tests, and the others through contact tracing.

Bloomberg says the restrictions are limited to just one area but could cause worry about broader restrictions.

In Shanghai, residents are adapting to a “new normal” of frequent mass testing,

The BBC reported, after the city of 25 million emerged from a strict two-month lockdown in early June.

Chinese companies have told some employees they must live at work temporarily to restrict possible transmission as much as possible to keep the economy running.

This week, two new studies strengthened the theory that the coronavirus originated at a marketplace in Wuhan, one of the earliest arguments explaining the virus’ emergence.

The country has had more than 2.2 million cases and 14,720 deaths.",0

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) announced today that event registration is open for the next National Drug & Alcohol Facts Week (NDAFW), to be held on Jan. 22-27, 2019. NDAFW is an annual, week-long series of educational events that link teens with scientific experts to SHATTER THE MYTHS about substance use and addiction. NIDA and NIAAA are both part of the National Institutes of Health.

Since its inception in 2010, NDAFW has continued to grow, with more than 2,100 NDAFW events held throughout all 50 states and in 35 countries last year. NDAFW events can be held by a variety of organizations, including schools, community groups, sports clubs, and hospitals, and/or promoted through a variety of vehicles, such as blogs or social media. Activities can focus on general drug use or on specific trends of concern in individual communities.

“Disseminating understandable science-based facts on substance use truly matters to the future health of communities in America and around the world, so we work to make it as easy as possible to hold events and promotional activities,” said NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, M.D. “Teens --wherever they live -- can only make smart choices when they are aware of the potential consequences of those choices.”

“Through this ongoing partnership with our NIDA colleagues we strive to stay connected with young people by sharing vital information about the harmful effects of alcohol use by teens,” said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. “For example, all teens should know that the brain is still developing into the mid-20’s, making the adolescent brain particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related harm that can last into adulthood.”

NIDA has produced a wide variety of resources for organizers of NDAFW events and promotional activities, including new resources for parents and educators:
• An online guide, which gives event organizers everything needed to plan and host a NDAFW event or activity.
• Online resources for parents and educators that offer classroom activities for NDAFW and other year-round lessons on drugs and alcohol, including an easy-to-use Lesson Plan and Activity Finder. New this year is an interactive infographic for help with safe disposal of unused prescription medicines.
• Free booklets with science-based facts about drugs and alcohol available to event planners who register online. Resources include one of NIDA’s most in-demand teen publications, Drugs: SHATTER THE MYTHS, which now has an Opioids: Facts for Teens booklet.
• Drug or audience-specific toolkits for event planners to use in their respective communities. New this year will be a toolkit on drugged driving for event organizers interested in addressing the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All toolkits will be updated in December as new data become available.
• New activity ideas for events, including the GRAMMY Foundation® and MusiCares® Teens! Make Music Contest. Additionally, NIDA will have a featured resources section updated weekly with suggestions for activities.
• Instructions on how to promote your event, including a “Tools for Success” presentation, sample press and social media outreach materials, and new tips and resources for online events (available later in the year).
• An easy-to-use registration page for events, distribution of materials and/or promotion of NDAFW through social media. No matter the size of the effort, registration is encouraged.

NIDA and NIAAA will also launch the newest National Drug & Alcohol IQ Challenge, a 12-question, multiple choice quiz that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Available in both English and Spanish, it can be projected on large screens at events, or used with mobile devices. More than 32,000 people took the IQ Challenge last year. The 2019 IQ challenge will be posted in January to the following link: https://teens.drugabuse.gov/quiz/national-drug-alcohol-facts-week/take-iq-challenge.

During the observance week, National Drugs & Alcohol Chat Day will be held on Thursday, Jan. 24, 2019 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST, where more than 50 NIH scientists and science writers will answer anonymous questions from teens in schools around the country. Registration for Chat Day will open later this year, on a first come, first served basis. In previous years, more than 50 schools participated with more than 10,000 questions submitted. Further details on the annual chat can be found at: https://teens.drugabuse.gov/national-drug-alcohol-facts-week/chat-with-scientists.

NDAFW is supported by many partners, including federal agencies, such as: the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy; the Office of Safe and Healthy Students in the U.S. Department of Education; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; and the Drug Enforcement Administration in the U.S. Department of Justice.

To receive an e-newsletter about NDAFW planning, organizations can e-mail NIDA at drugfacts@nida.nih.gov.

130,"Ground-breaking research from the University of Huddersfield, announced ahead of World Cancer Day 2021, demonstrates that scalp cooling physically protects hair follicles from chemotherapy drugs. It is the world's first piece of biological evidence that explains how scalp cooling actually works and the mechanism behind its protection of the hair follicle.

The study, entitled 'Cooling-mediated protection from chemotherapy drug-induced cytotoxicity in human keratinocytes by inhibition of cellular drug uptake', has been published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE.

The data was part of an innovative hair follicle research project carried out by the dedicated Scalp Cooling Research Centre based at the University of Huddersfield. It involved the cultivation of cells isolated from human hair follicles in the lab.

The £1 million Scalp Cooling Research Centre was established at the University in 2019 with the backing of Huddersfield firm Paxman -- global leaders in scalp cooling technology.

The team of experts in biology and design technology have been working together with the aim of Paxman becoming the only hair loss-preventing scalp cooling provider firmly based on biological research. It also brings the family-run business one step closer to achieving in its vision of 'zero hair loss' for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment.

Chemotherapy works by targeting all rapidly dividing cells in the body. Hair is the second fastest dividing cell, and this is the reason why many chemotherapy drugs cause alopecia. The hair follicles in the growth phase are attacked, resulting in hair loss approximately two weeks after the commencement of chemotherapy treatment.

Co-director of the centre and lead author of the journal article is Dr Nik Georgopoulos, a cancer expert at the University's Department of Biological Sciences who has collaborated with Paxman since 2011.

""Scalp cooling is currently the only treatment to combat 'chemotherapy-induced alopecia', yet little is known about its cytoprotective effect on human hair follicles,"" said Dr Georgopoulos.

Before now, he explained, the most common and obvious presumption to describe how scalp cooling worked was that as the scalp is cooled, the veins become constricted thereby reducing the amount of blood flow, meaning less of the chemotherapy drug enters the hair follicle.

""However, this is a really exciting discovery because our research now shows it is not as simple as that. We were able to measure how much chemotherapy drug goes into the cultured cells from hair follicles and what we have found is that cooling actually dramatically reduces the amount of chemotherapy drug being absorbed by the rapidly-diving cells of the hair follicle,"" he added.

This means there is now evidence for the first time, which demonstrates cooling has a direct effect on reducing the amount of drug that goes in and is not an indirect effect as thought before with the restricted blood flow.

""Our results provide evidence that attenuation of cellular drug uptake represents at least one of the mechanisms underpinning the ability of cooling to rescue human keratinocytes from chemotherapy drug-cytotoxicity, thus supporting the clinical efficacy of scalp cooling,"" he added.

In addition to providing evidence of how the treatment works, the Centre has also been working on developing innovative scalp cooling-related treatments and individual 3D-printed cooling caps. This has involved a collaboration of researchers from across two of the University's schools of study, the School of Applied Sciences and the School of Art, Design and Architecture.

""This latest project builds upon our previous research,"" continued Dr Georgopoulos.

""We had already demonstrated that if you cool at just 3 or 4 degrees lower, this can be the difference between the cells surviving or dying. We have now shown that a few degrees in temperature can also mean a more dramatic reduction in chemotherapy drug uptake by cells.

""The more evidence we can provide, the more data the designers have to facilitate the design of a better a cap. A better fit could mean more of a reduction in temperature, so more effective cooling means more survival of the follicles, leading to a better outcome.""

The percentage of hair loss can be further reduced when scalp cooling is combined with the application of a topical agent. One of the Centre's tasks has been to develop the best way to deliver this agent to hair follicles on the scalp.

Richard Paxman, CEO of Paxman, added: ""This latest research brings us one step closer to achieving our vision of 'zero hair loss' for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. This is fabulous news and is a ground-breaking step in the field of scalp cooling research.""",0

135,"An upper arm that swells to twice its normal size. A stomach that inexplicably swells up causing colic pain, vomiting or diarrhea. Or a life-threatening variant with severe swelling of the face, lips, tongue and larynx, bringing the risk of obstructed airways and death by suffocation.

This is how the mysterious and rare disease hereditary angioedema -- a hereditary form of acute swelling -- appears. The swelling happens because the patients lack a specific protein substance in their blood -- called C1-inhibitor -- which causes the blood vessels to leak fluid. When an attack that can happen daily, weekly or monthly occurs, patients must be quickly given the correct medicine, though they still face a dangerous and irksome way of life. Now, more than a half century after the first molecular details of the disease were described, there is pivotal new knowledge about the disease's biology:

""We have succeeded in identifying what takes place in the liver cells which produce the protein that the patients lack. This is the crucial first step towards having the ability to treat these patients with gene therapy, which is the interesting long-term perspective of our study,"" says Professor Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen from the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University, Denmark.

The research project documents that the hereditary genetic mutations which the patients have from one of their parents -- and which express the C1-inhibitor protein -- have a negative effect on the healthy gene from the other parent. Or, as it is put in the research article, which has just been published in JCI, the Journal of Clinical Investigation: Dominant negative SERPING1 variants cause intracellular retention of C1-inhibitor in hereditary angioedema.

""One of the mysteries about this disease has been the question of why the patients produce so little of the protein,"" says MSc Didde Haslund, who is a PhD student and the article's first author.

""Because with two hereditary genes -- a defect from one of the parents and a normal one from the other -- you would think that the production will be around half the normal dose. Yet these patients produce only 10-20 per cent of a normal level. But now we have, for the first time, an explanation at cellular level and this is crucial for the continuing work on gene therapy as a future treatment option,"" she says.

One of the difficulties related to the disease is that it only affects 1 in 10,000-50,000 people. This corresponds to fewer than 330 people in the whole of Scandinavia being diagnosed, which in turn has the unfortunate consequence that medical doctors regularly mistake it for allergy, even though allergy medicine has no effect in the event of an attack.

""The diagnosis is made with a blood test that measures the concentration and function of C1-inhibitor in the blood. However, this requires that the medical doctor is aware of the disease,"" says Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen as he directs attention to a thought-provoking aspect of researching a rare disease.

""You might sometimes think that with so few patients, perhaps we ought to concentrate on something that can help more people. But on the other hand, we actually have a national strategy for rare diseases, because as a whole this is a large patient group. The individual rare diseases don't affect many people but taken together there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Danes with rare diagnoses,"" he says.

Hereditary angioedema is characterised by attacks occurring suddenly and unexpectedly. They may be provoked by a range of factors ranging from physical exertion and other forms of physical stress to infections, hormonal factors and individual drugs.

Generally, the diagnosed patients are assigned to Odense University Hospital, as this is the national competence centre for treatment. It was also Anette Bygum, professor and research director at the hospital, who initially contacted Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen to hear more about the possibilities of gene therapy, thereby arousing his curiosity.

""For the whole team, Annette Bygum's enquiry turned out to be the beginning of a journey into a world that we who normally work on basic research are not part of on a daily basis. We have discussed our research with practitioners, presented the results for patients and international patient associations and shared our experiences with the medicinal industry. We were invited to join the club, and this has led to both an interdisciplinary project and a crucial research result,"" says Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen.",0
136,"Nov. 18, 2022 – The FDA has approved the first treatment to delay the start of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, the agency announced this week. Clinical trials showed the injectable drug, which will be sold under the name Tzield, delayed the start of the disease by more than 2 years, the FDA said. It’s designed for adults and children 8 years and older who have stage 2 type 1 diabetes. Tzield is injected once daily for 14 consecutive days. When patients with type 1 diabetes progress to stage 3, they usually need insulin shots for life. They also face more serious health risks such as diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening, the company that developed the drug, Provention Bio, said in a news release. “The onset of stage 3 [type 1 diabetes] is a life-changing moment,” Eleanor Ramos, MD, Provention Bio chief medical officer, said in the release. “Once insulin-producing cells are no longer capable of maintaining normal glycemic control, this irreversible condition can lead to the need, in just one year, for a patient, 1,460 finger sticks to check blood glucose levels, around 1,100 insulin injections, and experiencing an average of 127 episodes of hypoglycemia.”

The “approval of teplizumab in the U.S. is the start of a seismic shift in how type 1 diabetes is treated,” he said in a statement. “For 100 years, people living with type 1 diabetes have relied on insulin to treat the condition, and today’s decision means that for the first time, the root cause of the condition – an immune system attack – can be tackled, and type 1 diabetes potentially delayed for up to 3 years.” With type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys cells that make insulin. Tzield works by turning off some of those immune system cells while increasing the share of cells that help moderate the immune response, the FDA said. “The drug’s potential to delay clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes may provide patients with months to years without the burdens of disease,” John Sharretts, MD, director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity at the FDA, said in the release.

Provention Bio is partnering with Sanofi, a French company, to distribute the drug. Jason Hoitt, Provention's chief commercial officer, said the drug should be available to the public in early 2023, according to Reuters. As of 2019, 37.3 million Americans had diabetes – 11.3% of the population, the American Diabetes Association said. About 1.9 million had type 1 diabetes.",0
139,"What Is an Allergy? It's what happens when your immune system reacts to something that’s usually harmless. Those triggers, which doctors call ""allergens,"" can include pollen, mold, and animal dander, certain foods, or things that irritate your skin. Allergies are very common. At least 1 in 5 Americans has one.

What Happens During an Allergic Reaction? It starts when you come into contact with a trigger that you inhale, swallow, or get on your skin. In response, your body starts to make a protein called IgE, which grabs onto the allergen. Then histamine and other chemicals get released into the blood. That causes the symptoms you notice.

What Are the Symptoms? Your symptoms depend on how you’re exposed -- through the air, your skin, food, or through an insect sting. If you’ve got a nasal allergy (one that's triggered by something you inhale), common symptoms include: Common symptoms of a skin allergy include rashes and hives (a rash with raised red patches). Your skin may be red, itchy, or swollen.

Food allergies can also cause stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. If an insect sting was the trigger, you’ll have swelling, redness, and pain where it stung you. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Most go away shortly after the exposure stops. Mild ones may be almost unnoticeable. You might just feel a little “off.” Moderate symptoms can make you feel ill, as if you’ve got a cold or even the flu.

The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. It affects your whole body. Symptoms can include:
• Hives and itching all over
• Hoarseness or tightness in the throat
• Swelling of the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, or throat
• None Tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or scalp Anaphylaxis is life-threatening, so call 911 right away. If you have an epinephrine auto-injector, use it and repeat after 5 to 15 minutes if your symptoms haven’t improved. You’ll still need medical care right after you give yourself the shots, even if your symptoms seem to stop, because a delayed reaction could still happen.",0
140,"Researchers identify the high costs of living with sickle cell disease

Potential curative therapies may help reduce the burden, but are also costly.

Americans ages 64 and younger with commercial health insurance who live with sickle cell disease (SCD) pay almost four times more in out-of-pocket medical costs over their lifetimes, a total of $44,000, compared to people living without the disease. And insurers pay $1.7 million on average for each person living with SCD, according to new research supported by the National Institutes of Health.

The healthcare spending analysis, which published today in Blood Advances, underscored the significant financial toll that sickle cell disease, an inherited blood condition, has on patients, their families, and the healthcare system.

“Identifying ways to reduce the burden many people living with SCD face is a critical part of coordinated research,” said Kate Johnson, Ph.D., a study author who completed the research while working at The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, Economics Institute at the University of Washington, Seattle. “We hope this analysis complements the larger scientific quest to identify cures for sickle cell disease.”

To calculate the lifetime out-of-pocket medical costs for men and women living with sickle cell disease, researchers analyzed commercial health insurance claims filed between 2007-2018 by 20,891 people younger than age 65 living with SCD and compared those claims to those filed by 33,588 people of the same age and sex who did not have SCD.

The researchers then adjusted for average life expectancy. The average age of patients with SCD in this review was 25, and the average life expectancy was age 51 for women and age 50 for men. The average life expectancy in this review for people without SCD was age 62 for women and age 60 for men. (The average life expectancy for Americans is 77, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

The researchers found that people living with SCD had more medical appointments, more urgent care and emergency medical visits, and more prescriptions, compared to people without the disease. They also had higher out-of-pocket medical costs, which averaged about $1,300 each year.

These costs, the study found, peak between ages 13-24, a period when many people with SCD transition from pediatric to adult care and may have increased medical visits. This increase, the authors said, could be explained by patients having challenges identifying or connecting with SCD specialists as well as with providers who understand their needs. Research has shown that many patients with SCD experience stigma related to seeking care for pain and may encounter institutional racism, which can result in patients switching providers.

The authors noted that because they limited their review to commercial health insurance, which is used by just one-third of people living with SCD, healthcare costs may vary and be even higher for those using Medicaid, Medicare, or who don’t have insurance.

Another point they shared is that future analyses could benefit by accounting for the indirect costs of living with SCD, including those associated with family caregiving and reduced productivity. Some researchers have estimated that people with SCD lose around $700,000 over the course of their lifetime because of their inability to work. Pairing these types of analyses with healthcare spending could then provide a comprehensive lifetime cost of living with SCD.

SCD affects 100,000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. It occurs when the body is unable to produce adequate levels of normal hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Without enough normal hemoglobin, red blood cells change from round cells that help deliver oxygen to the body’s tissues to disc-shaped, or sickled, cells that can clump together and block blood flow. This can lead to severe complications, including excruciating pain, infections, and stroke.

Current therapies, such as hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxeletor, are used to treat the symptoms of SCD. Blood and bone marrow transplants serve as a curative therapy for many people, but aren’t recommended for everyone. Researchers are currently studying how gene therapy may provide another curative treatment option for SCD. The study foreshadowed future discussions about the costs of cures for the disease as promising, yet expensive, gene therapies and treatments are being studied.

The authors noted that these transformative therapies could greatly reduce current medical costs, many related to the severe complications that come with SCD. But how patients access and pay for them, ultimately will be informed by conversations among policymakers, insurers, and patients.

“We have made exciting scientific advances to help people living with sickle cell disease,” said Gary H. Gibbons, M.D., director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the NIH. “However, these advances must go hand-in-hand with scalable innovations that will ensure equitable access to life-altering care.”

NHLBI supported the study, along with the Cure Sickle Cell Disease Initiative, an NHLBI-led research partnership created to identify curative SCD therapies that could be used in clinical research studies between 2023-2028.

145,"A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) found that they were well tolerated and generally safe when administered simultaneously to healthy adults. The experimental mAbs, REGN3048 and REGN3051, target the MERS coronavirus (MERS CoV) spike protein used by the virus to attach to and infect target cells. The mAbs were discovered and developed by scientists at the biopharmaceutical company Regeneron, located in Tarrytown, New York. The trial was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The trial was the first to test the experimental antibodies in people. Conducted at WCCT Global, a clinical trial site in California, the study enrolled 48 healthy adults, 36 of whom received the mAbs. All volunteers were followed for 121 days after receiving mAbs (or placebo) by intravenous infusion. No serious adverse events occurred.

In preclinical studies, investigators at Regeneron and the University of Maryland, College Park, also administered REGN3048 and REGN3051 sequentially and in combination to genetically modified mice that, unlike wild-type mice, can be infected with MERS CoV. When administered one day prior to coronavirus exposure, both REGN3048 and REGN3051 reduced the levels of virus later detected in the lungs, with co-administration providing more potent protective effects than either mAb alone. Similarly, co-administering the mAbs one day after MERS CoV exposure provided a therapeutic benefit in mice by lowering viral levels and lessening tissue damage in the lungs as compared to mice that received placebo.

Together, the findings from the clinical trial and the preclinical mouse studies “demonstrate the potential efficacy and utility of monoclonal antibody therapy for the prevention or treatment of MERS-CoV and lays the groundwork for the development of spike-targeted mAb therapies for other infectious disease threats, including SARS-CoV-2,” which causes COVID-19, the authors conclude.

154,"Prostate cancer often becomes lethal as it spreads to the bones, and the process behind this deadly feature could potentially be turned against it as a target for bone-targeting radiation and potential new therapies.

In a study published online Tuesday in the journal PLOS ONE, Duke Cancer Institute researchers describe how prostate cancer cells develop the ability to mimic bone-forming cells called osteoblasts, enabling them to proliferate in the bone microenvironment.

Attacking these cells with radium-233, a radioactive isotope that selectively targets cells in these bone metastases, has been shown to prolong patients' lives. But a better understanding of how radium works in the bone was needed.

The mapping of this mimicking process could lead to a more effective use of radium-233 and to the development of new therapies to treat or prevent the spread of prostate cancer to bone.

""Given that most men who die of prostate cancer have bone metastases, this work is critical to helping understand this process,"" said lead author Andrew Armstrong, M.D., director of research at the Duke Cancer Institute Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers.

Armstrong and colleagues enrolled a small study group of 20 men with symptomatic bone-metastatic prostate cancer. When analyzing the circulating tumor cells from study participants, they found that bone-forming enzymes appeared to be expressed commonly, and that genetic alterations in bone forming pathways were also common in these prostate cancer cells.

They validated these new genetic findings in a separate multicenter trial involving a larger group of more than 40 men with prostate cancer and bone metastases.

Following treatment with radium-223, the researchers found that the radioactive isotope was concentrated in bone metastases, but tumor cells still circulated and cancer progressed within six months of therapy. The researchers found a range of complex genetic alterations in these tumor cells that likely enabled them to persist and develop resistance to the radiation over time.

""Osteomimicry may contribute in part to how prostate cancer spreads to bone, but also to the uptake of radium-223 within bone metastases and may thereby enhance the therapeutic benefit of this bone targeting radiotherapy,"" Armstrong said. He said by mapping this lethal pathway of prostate cancer bone metastasis, the study points to new targets and thus critical areas of research into designing better tumor-targeting therapies.",0

162,"Aug. 2, 2022 – The monkeypox outbreak has led officials in states and cities to declare public health emergencies.

California and Illinois declared such emergencies for the outbreak on Monday to speed up prevention and vaccination, according to NBC News.

The announcements mirrored similar emergency declarations made last week in New York state, New York City, and San Francisco.

The emergency declarations line up with the highest cases numbers in the country, according to the latest CDC data. The U.S. has reported more than 5,800 monkeypox cases nationwide, with 1,390 in New York, 827 in California, and 520 in Illinois. Florida and Georgia follow close behind, with 442 and 430 cases each.

On Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said it’s time for a “whole-of-government response to monkeypox.”

“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” he said in a statement.",0
165,"Most reported substance use among adolescents held steady in 2022

The percentage of adolescents reporting substance use in 2022 largely held steady after significantly declining in 2021, according to the latest results from the Monitoring the Future survey of substance use behaviors and related attitudes among eighth, 10th, and 12th graders in the United States. Reported use for almost all substances decreased dramatically from 2020 to 2021 after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related changes like school closures and social distancing. In 2022, reported use of any illicit drug within the past year remained at or significantly below pre-pandemic levels for all grades, with 11% of eighth graders, 21.5% of 10th graders, and 32.6% of 12th graders reporting any illicit drug use in the past year.

The Monitoring the Future survey is conducted each year by researchers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“The Monitoring the Future Survey is one of the best and most timely tools we have to monitor and understand changes in substance use among young people over time, including through historic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Nora Volkow, M.D., NIDA director. “It is encouraging that we did not observe a significant increase in substance use in 2022, even as young people largely returned to in-person school, extracurricular activities, and other social engagements.”

The Monitoring the Future survey is given annually to students in eighth, 10th, and 12th grades who self-report their substance use behaviors over various time periods, such as past 30 days, past 12 months, and lifetime. The survey also documents students’ perception of harm, disapproval of use, and perceived availability of drugs. Notably, the survey results are released the same year the data are collected.

From February through June 2022, the Monitoring the Future investigators collected 31,438 surveys from students enrolled across 308 public and private schools in the United States. The completed survey from 2022 is nationally representative and represents about 75% of the sample size of a typical year’s data collection. The Monitoring the Future investigators noted that schools opt-in to participate in the survey, and some schools that normally participate opted-out this year as they continued to operationally recover from the pandemic. All participating students took the survey via the web – either on tablets or on a computer – with between 95-99% of respondents taking the survey in-person in school.

The survey found that adolescents most commonly reported use of alcohol, nicotine vaping, and cannabis in the past year, and levels generally held steady with those reported in 2021. For substances where reported past-year use did increase between 2021 and 2022, the vast majority of reported use remained at or below the pre-pandemic levels observed in 2020. Compared to levels observed in 2021, data reported in 2022 show:
• Nicotine vaping remained stable for all three grades surveyed, with 12% of eighth graders, 20.5% of 10th graders, and 27.3% of 12th graders reporting vaping nicotine in the past year.
• Cannabis use also remained stable for all three grades surveyed, with 8.3% of eighth graders, 19.5% of 10th graders, and 30.7% of 12th graders reporting cannabis use in the past year. Of note, 6.0% of eighth graders, 15.0% of 10th graders, and 20.6% of 12th graders reported vaping cannabis within the past year, reflecting a stable trend at the pre-pandemic level among eighth and 12th graders, and a small increase in reported use among 10th graders, though reported use among 10th graders in 2022 is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.
• Alcohol use remained stable for eighth and 10th graders (with 15.2% and 31.3% reporting use in the past year, respectively) but returned to pre-pandemic levels for 12th graders in 2022 (with 51.9% of 12th graders reporting alcohol use in the past year).
• Any illicit drug use other than marijuana also remained stable for all three grades surveyed, with 4.9% of eighth graders, 5.7% of 10th graders, and 8.0% of 12th graders reporting any illicit drug use other than marijuana in the past year. These data build on long-term trends documenting low and fairly steady use of illicit substances reported among teenagers – including past-year use of cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, generally.
• Use of narcotics other than heroin (including Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, etc.) increased slightly among 12th graders between 2021 and 2022 (with 1.7% of 12th graders reporting use within the past year), consistent with the pre-pandemic levels observed in 2019 and 2020 (2.7% and 2.1%, respectively).

When asked a range of questions about the perceived harmfulness of occasionally taking specific prescription medications (such as OxyContin and Vicodin), or the risk of “narcotics other than heroin” overall, the percentage of students who reported perceiving a “great risk” ranged from 22.9% among eighth graders to 52.9% among 12th graders. The percentage of respondents who reported perceiving a “great risk” associated with taking Adderall occasionally ranged from 28.1% among eighth graders to 39.6% among 12th graders.

Though the data have indicated stable or declining use of illicit drugs among young people over many years, other research has reported a recent dramatic rise in overdose deaths among young people ages 14-18. This increase is largely attributed to illicit fentanyl, a potent synthetic drug, contaminating the supply of counterfeit pills made to resemble prescription medications like benzodiazepines, ADHD medications, and opioids.

“The proliferation of fentanyl in the drug supply is of enormous concern. Though the data indicate that drug use is not becoming more common among young people than it has been in the past, the tragic increase in overdose deaths among this population suggest that drug use is becoming more dangerous than ever before,” said Dr. Volkow. “It is absolutely crucial to educate young people that pills purchased via social media, given to someone by a friend, or obtained from an unknown source may contain deadly fentanyl.”

The results were gathered from a nationally representative sample, and the data were statistically weighted to provide national numbers. This year, 11% of the 12th grade students who took the survey identified as African American, 22% as Hispanic, 5% as Asian, 1% as American Indian or Alaska Native, 47% as white, 1% as Middle Eastern, and 14% as more than one of the preceding categories. The survey also asks respondents to identify as male, female, other, or prefer not to answer. For the 2022 survey, 48% of 12th grade students identified as male, 47% identified as female, 1% identified as other, and 4% selected the “prefer not to answer” option.

“We were curious to see whether the significant decreases in substance use we observed last year would continue into the future, and we now see that there may indeed be a longer lasting impact for some substances,” said Richard A. Miech, Ph.D., team lead of the Monitoring the Future study at the University of Michigan. “The fact that cannabis use and nicotine vaping did not appear to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 is a fascinating data point. Moving forward, it will be important to continue to monitor these trends to understand the impact on future drug use behavior and outcomes.”

The 2022 Monitoring the Future data tables highlighting the survey results are available online from the University of Michigan.

167,"Aug. 2, 2022 – Imagine being wheeled into the operating room where your surgical team awaits – the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and … a tiny robot crab. Northwestern University scientists have built a super-small robot crab that could one day carry out delicate surgical tasks – entering your body to suture small, ruptured arteries, clear clogged arteries, or track down cancerous tumors. The six-legged, half-millimeter-wide peekytoe crab, described in a recent issue of Science Robotics, is the world’s smallest remote-controlled walking robot. It can bend, twist, walk, and jump and is operated using a remote-controlled laser. It’s one of the newest advances in research spanning a decade that aims to create miniature machines to do practical jobs in hard-to-reach places. This synthetic crustacean and other “microrobots” may be helping surgical teams sooner than you think, thanks to advances in robotics and materials science. But what must happen before this future becomes reality? Making a flea-sized robot crab is “pretty simple,” says bioelectronics engineer John Rogers, PhD, who led the research. “It consists of three types of materials: a polymer, a shape-memory alloy, and glass.” The polymer, a plastic-like material, is used in microelectronics. The second component, the shape-memory metal alloy, is bonded with the polymer to make up the joints and legs. The third component is a thin coating of glass applied to the entire outside of the robot’s body. “The glass provides an exoskeleton. It gives a rigidity to the overall body of the robot,” says Rogers. The robot operator points a laser at a specific spot on the crab, triggering a thermal mechanism that makes the robot move. “By shining it on certain limbs, we can create a specific gait,” Rogers says, explaining that the heat “unfolds” the crab. When the robot cools, it returns to its original shape. This folding and unfolding creates locomotion – the crab walks. Rogers credits his students with choosing the crab – they liked the way it scooted sideways – but he says any creature could probably be made smaller. How Will We Use Tiny Robots in Medicine?

While Rogers hesitates to sell any specific medical use too hard, surgical applications seem most promising for this technology. For use deep inside the human body, Rogers says, “you’d probably want a swimmer – like a fish. There are other groups working on swimmers.” Renee Zhao, PhD, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University, is one such scientist. In a newNature Communicationsarticle, she and her colleagues report on their “spinning-enabled wireless amphibious origami millirobot.” (Say that five times fast.) The mini robot – closer to the size of a fingertip – looks like a tiny cylinder and features an origami-inspired pattern that twists and buckles. It glides through viscous liquid and over slick surfaces and masses (such as human organs), rolling, flipping, and spinning with the help of a remote magnet. The folding and unfolding of the cylinder serve as a pumping mechanism and can be used for targeted delivery of a liquid drug. It might, for instance, carry medicines into the body to help stop internal bleeding, Zhao says. “We are improving the system by further downsizing it for biomedical applications in narrower environments such as in blood vessels,” she says. In their paper, Zhao and her co-authors also note that mini cameras and mini forceps could be put into the millirobots to perform endoscopy and biopsy procedures, which in theory might carry less risk to patients than current techniques. But there was a lot of trial and error during the design stage of the robot, Zhao says. “The trickiest part is to have an optimized swimming performance,” she says, because the density of the robot needs to be very close to the density of the liquid it is “swimming” in. Right now, Zhao’s amphibious robot is still in the trial stages that come before animal testing. If it clears those hurdles, it will then be studied in human clinical trials. That means it will likely take years before swimming cylinders – or robot crabs, for that matter – are helping cardiac surgical teams or suturing organs. “This is early-stage exploratory work,” Rogers says. “We are trying to introduce ideas as part of a broader community of researchers pursuing micro-robotic technologies, with the hope that over time, these technologies will ultimately lead to practical clinical uses for surgical purposes. It’s very much a starting point.”",0

• Of the 37 million Americans with diabetes, approximately 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes, according to the .
• In a clinical trial directly comparing different medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, researchers found that two drugs — insulin glargine and liraglutide — worked “modestly” better.
• All four drugs tested — including glimepiride and sitagliptin — improved blood glucose levels to some extent when added to metformin. In a large clinical trial directly comparing four medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, researchers found that two drugs — insulin glargine and liraglutide — worked “modestly” better at helping people maintain their blood glucose levels. All four drugs — including glimepiride and sitagliptin — improved blood glucose levels to some extent when added to metformin, a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, the study showed. Keeping blood sugar levels within the recommended range can help reduce the risk of the complications of type 2 diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and vision problems. Of the 37 million Americans with diabetes, approximately 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes, according to the . “Knowing that we are fighting an obesity epidemic and that type 2 diabetes trends are going up, even in pediatric patients, this gives more tools to healthcare providers to help achieve [blood glucose] control,” said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, chief health correspondent and medical affairs officer at AltaMed Health Services in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research. However, in spite of the improvements seen with all four drugs, nearly three-quarters of study participants were not able to keep their blood glucose levels within the recommended range over the course of the 5-year follow-up period. “The overall results of the current trial highlight the difficulty in achieving and maintaining recommended [blood glucose] levels in participants with type 2 diabetes,” the researchers wrote, “even in a clinical trial in which all care [including medications] is provided free of charge.”

The study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Researchers enrolled 5,047 people with type 2 diabetes who were already taking metformin. Almost two-thirds of participants were white, one-fifth were Black and almost one-fifth identified as Hispanic or Latinx. This “multicultural patient base … helps bring a better understanding of how different groups in our communities can be served,” said Shapiro. Researchers randomly assigned participants to receive one of four medications alongside metformin. Sitagliptin, liraglutide, and glimepiride act by increasing insulin levels. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin. Researchers followed participants for an average of 5 years. During this time, participants taking liraglutide or insulin glargine were able to achieve and maintain their blood glucose levels within the recommended range for the longest time, compared to those taking sitagliptin or glimepiride. Glargine was the most effective at helping people maintain the target blood glucose levels; sitagliptin was the least effective. Researchers found that the effect of the medications on blood glucose levels did not differ based on age, sex, race or ethnicity. However, people who started the study with higher blood glucose levels had “progressively worse metabolic outcomes” with sitagliptin compared to the other treatments, researchers said in the paper. The results were published online Sept. 21 in The New England Journal of Medicine as two papers, one about the blood glucose outcomes and another about the cardiovascular outcomes.

The study also looked the medications’ effects on the risk of people developing diabetes-related cardiovascular disease. People taking liraglutide had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease overall, compared to those taking one of the other medications, researchers found. Researchers also examined the side effects of the drugs, finding:
• Severe hypoglycemia — low blood glucose levels — was uncommon, but occurred more frequently in people taking glimepiride. Shapiro said this side effect is concerning enough that it needs to be “monitored and managed” by patients and their doctors.
• Gastrointestinal side effects were more common in people taking liraglutide compared to those taking one of the other medications. In addition, people taking liraglutide or sitagliptin lost more weight (7.7 pounds and 4.4 pounds, respectively) than those taking glargine or glimepiride (less than 2 pounds). One limitation of the study is that it did not include a type of medication used to treat type 2 diabetes called SGLT2 inhibitors, which were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration at the start of the study. In addition, researchers said in the paper that during the trial, participants’ medications were frequently adjusted, which “may not reflect the slow rate of medication adjustments in the clinical setting.” Still, the results of the study may help doctors and patients decide on the best medication treatments for type 2 diabetes. “For a long time we had the ‘gold standard’ of metformin and insulin,” said Shapiro. “Now we are moving forward with a better understanding of how to help our patients with the current medications.” In addition to prescription drugs, people can also help by eating well, staying physically active and maintaining a healthy weight. “Diabetes is not just a ‘sugar problem,’ it requires a change in the way that we perceive health,” said Shapiro. So we “need to have a multidimensional approach: healthy diet, moderate-intensity movement, good sleeping habits and mental health support.” In addition, he thinks communities can benefit from the services of — known in Spanish as promotoras or promotores — who can help guide patients toward wellness. “Medications are a key part of the conversation,” he said, “but we cannot forget the complex lives that we live.”",0

172,"Aug. 12, 2022 -- In what some are calling the next iteration of the internet, the metaverse is an unfamiliar digital world where you could be an avatar navigating computer-generated places and interacting with others in real time. In this space, the constraints of our physical, bricks and mortar world and travel habits fade. And new opportunities and challenges emerge. At the University of Connecticut Health in Farmington, doctors in training got a first taste of what life could be like in a futuristic place like this when residents were given virtual reality headsets for the first time. In a historic moment, orthopedic surgeries were largely put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, says Olga Solovyova, MD, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at UConn Health. Now, residents put on goggles and see their avatars (digital representations of themselves) in a virtual operating room with a table, instruments and a virtual patient. They manipulate the instruments with controllers and feel the resistance when they saw or drill a bone and they feel the pressure drop when they cut through completely. In VR, they can also peel away virtual layers of skin and muscle to better view the bone underneath. Training modules give feedback on how well students complete procedures and track their progress. ""Classically it was always the 'see one; do one; teach one,' mentality, watching first and then practicing then teaching others,"" Solovyova says. Now residents can practice on their own repeatedly in a safe environment with professional feedback. It also allows practicing rare surgeries that might not come up in real-life patients, Solovyova says. Such training in digital environments like the metaverse is starting to become more common at other surgical residency programs in the U.S., she says. Some aspects of the metaverse – a term just beginning to make its way into conversations – are already here like VR training, telemedicine and 3D printing. Facebook's announcement last year that it would be rebranded as Meta set off ripples of curiosity about the concept. Definitions differ, but at its core the metaverse is the space where VR, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (where unrelated devices communicate with each other), quantum computing and several other technologies come together to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

A report by industry trends analyst Gartner predicts that 25% of people in the world will spend at least an hour a day in the metaverse by 2026, whether for work, shopping, education or entertainment. And with the wearable technology today, people can monitor their vitals and update their doctor with real-time data. Barry Issenberg, MD, director of the Gordon Center for Simulation and Innovation in Medical Education at the University of Miami, says electronic health records in the metaverse will likely become living documents updated from sensors in clothing or furniture, on phone apps or wearable devices. Instead of people coming into a doctor's office to be examined and have lab values interpreted, doctors will already have much of the picture in uploaded data. That, he says, will help address a common complaint that with electronic health records medical visits have become strained with doctors distracted by typing information into templates. Doctors can also set parameters for abnormalities so that if a patient's blood pressure gets too high or walking abnormalities are detected, the doctor will be notified, enabling more proactive, preventative care. Because people will also get the information in real time, they can become more engaged in their own care, Issenberg says. In Miami, clinicians are working with emergency responders in the community using virtual tools. They can show a learner using a stethoscope, for instance, the anatomy that lies underneath the chest so the responders don't have to imagine a heart pumping — they can see it on a screen while hearing the sounds. At Miami's Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute, Issenberg says, a doctor developed personal goggles that can detect the visual response of patients. The goggles are sent to patients with vision problems so doctors can conduct exams without the patient having to come into the center. A major stumbling block for ushering in the metaverse is a problem that has thwarted progress in the use of electronic health records, too. Health systems use different technologies that often don't talk to each other. The metaverse will find more seamless connectivity in large, contained systems such as the Veterans Administration, Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic, Issenberg says.

And clinical trial recruitment, patient engagement and monitoring could also look different in the metaverse, says Nimita Limaye, PhD, research vice president of Life Sciences R&D Strategy at International Data Corp., headquartered in Needham, MA. Many of the challenges associated with clinical trials include a big burden on patients, which can result in people not following directions or dropping out of trials. Questionnaires can be long and difficult to fill out. Virtual assistants could issue reminders on medications, ask patients how they are feeling each day, read questions to people and record the answers for investigators. ""I don't think that's very far away,"" Limaye says, noting that voice commands are much more convenient than downloading and using apps, especially for older people who may have poor eyesight. Amazon Web Services is already working with its voice and Chatbot solutions, Alexa and Amazon Lex, to improve clinical trial participation, reduce dropout rates and improve the quality of the data recorded. One day, Limaye says, people with a particular disease or condition could ask a virtual assistant such as Alexa what clinical trials are available for them. Exclusion and inclusion criteria could be built into the technology and the virtual assistant could answer with a list of trials and directions on how to sign up. COVID-19 Limaye says, already changed clinical trials and made it more common for people to participate from home through telehealth, home health nurses, wearables and the direct-to-patient shipment of drugs and devices. ""The life sciences industry saw the proof of concept that technology can work with clinical trials,"" she says. As technologies advance, Limaye adds, equitable access will be critical. While few can afford a sophisticated virtual reality headset yet, she points out, other solutions may be more widely accessible.",0
180,"New insight into grape seed extract as a therapeutic and preventative measure to fight obesity-induced kidney damage is presented in a new study. Grape seed and skin extract (GSSE) is known to contain powerful antioxidants. This study, published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, is the first to make a link between GSSEs and high-fat-diet-induced renal disease.

The authors examined the effect of GSSE processed from a grape cultivar ('Carignan') of Vitis vinifera from northern Tunisia on rats. Rats were fed a high-fat diet that induced a low-grade reno-lipotoxicity, that is, kidney damage associated with lipids. This was characterized by elevations in plasma urea and protein in the urine. The researchers found increased deposits of triglycerides (TG) (especially saturated fatty acids), increased signs of oxidative stress and depleted copper levels in the kidneys. There was also histological evidence of disturbance in the kidney structure. When the animals received GSSE at 500 mg/kg bw (which corresponds to 35g/day for a 70 kg human adult) along with the high-fat diet there was a partial reversal of the TG deposition as well as the histological damage. The authors suggest polyphenols including resveratrol are likely the components in GSSE responsible for the positive effects. Furthermore the GSSE prevented the oxidative stress and copper depletion.

""In our research, obesity-induced leaky kidney and proteinuria are shown to be prevented by GSSE, which suggests the use of GSSE as a preventive nutriceutical for high-risk patients,"" said co-author Kamel Charradi, a researcher with the Laboratory of Bioactive Substance at the Center of Biotechnology of Borj-Cedria (CBBC) in Tunisia. This research group has previously published work showing the benefits of GSSE in combating obesity, heart dysfunction, brain lipotoxicity and kidney cancer.

181,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Damage to DNA is a daily occurrence but one that human cells have evolved to manage. Now, in a new paper published in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Mayo researchers have determined how one DNA repair protein gets to the site of DNA damage. The authors say they hope this discovery research will help identify new therapies for ovarian cancer.

While the human genome is constantly damaged, cells have proteins that detect and repair the damage. One of those proteins is called 53BP1. It is involved in the repair of DNA when both strands break. In the publication, Georges Mer, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic structural biologist, and his team report on how 53BP1 relocates to chromosomes to do its job.

Dr. Mer explains that, in the absence of DNA damage, 53BP1 is inactive ─ blocked by a protein called ""TIRR."" Using a visualization technique called X-ray crystallography, the authors show that TIRR obstructs an area on 53BP1 that 53BP1 uses to bind chromosomes. But what shifts TIRR away from 53BP1, so the repair protein can work?

The authors theorized that a type of nucleic acid called RNA was responsible for this shift. To test their theory, they engineered a protein that would bind to the 53BP1 repair protein and the RNA molecules released when DNA is damaged. This effort, plus other work detailed in the paper, provides evidence that their idea was sound. The authors report that when DNA damage occurs, RNA molecules produced at that time can bind to TIRR, displacing it from 53BP1 and allowing 53BP1 to swing into action.

“Our study provides a proof-of-principle mechanism for how RNA molecules can trigger the localization of 53BP1 to DNA damage sites,” says Dr. Mer. “The TIRR/RNA pair can be seen as an off/on switch that blocks or triggers 53BP1 relocation to DNA damage sites.”

Also in the paper, the authors report that displacing TIRR increases sensitivity of cells in cell culture to olaparib, a drug used to treat patients with ovarian cancer.

""Unfortunately, over time cancer cells develop resistance to drugs in this category, called 'PARP inhibitors.' Our work provides a new target, TIRR, for developing therapeutics that would help specifically kill ovarian cancer cells,"" Dr. Mer says.

Collaborators on this work include the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford in the U.K. In addition to Dr. Mer, other Mayo Clinic authors are Maria Victoria Botuyan, Ph.D., Gaofeng Cui, Ph.D., James R.

187,"Researchers from CeMM Research Center of Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Medical University of Vienna and Stanford University School of Medicine, have found that a module of the immune system, which is best known for causing allergic reactions, plays a key role in acquiring host defense against infections triggered by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This ""allergy module,"" constituted by mast cells and Immunoglobulin E, can grant protection and increased resistance against secondary bacterial infections in the body. These findings indicate a beneficial function for allergic immune responses and are now published in the journal Immunity.

Allergy is one of the most common diseases in Europe, it is estimated that more than 150 million Europeans suffer from recurring allergies and by 2025 this could have increased to half of the entire European population.* Allergic patients initially undergo a process of ""sensitization,"" meaning that their immune system develops a specific class of antibodies, so called Immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), which can recognize external proteins, referred to as allergens. IgEs bind and interact with cells that express a specific receptor called FcεR1. There are only a few cell types in the body that express the FcεR1 receptor and probably the most important ones are mast cells, a type of immune cell found in most tissues throughout the body.

When re-exposed to the allergen, mast cells (with IgE bound to their FcεR1 receptors) immediately react by rapidly releasing different mediators (e.g. histamine, proteases or cytokines) that cause the classic allergic symptoms. These symptoms depend on the tissue where the contact with the allergen happens and can range from sneezing/wheezing (respiratory tract) to diarrhea and abdominal pain (gastrointestinal tract) or itching (skin). Systemic exposure to allergens can activate a large number of mast cells from different organs at the same time, causing anaphylaxis, a serious and life-threatening allergic reaction.

Despite decades of research and detailed knowledge of the critical role of IgEs and mast cells in allergies, the physiological, beneficial function of this ""allergy module"" is still not completely understood. In 2006, Stephen J. Galli, senior co-author of this study, and his laboratory at Stanford University revealed the importance of mast cells for innate resistance against venoms of certain snakes and the honeybee (Science. 2006 Jul 28;313(5786):526-30. DOI: 10.1126/science.1128877). Subsequent work from the Galli laboratory showed the critical role of the ""allergy module"" in acquired host defense against high doses of venom (Immunity. 2013 Nov 14;39(5):963-75. doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2013.10.005): this finding (to which Philipp Starkl, first author of the current study, contributed importantly) represented the first clear experimental evidence supporting the ""Toxin Hypothesis"" postulated by Margie Profet in 1991. This hypothesis proposed a beneficial function for allergic reactions against noxious substances (Q Rev Biol. 1991 Mar;66(1):23-62. doi: 10.1086/417049).

Following up on this discovery, Philipp Starkl, Senior Postdoctoral fellow at the Medical University of Vienna and CeMM, together with Sylvia Knapp, Professor at the Medical University of Vienna and CeMM PI, and Stephen J. Galli, Professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, and colleagues, set out to investigate whether this phenomenon could be relevant in defense against other toxin-producing organisms, in particular, pathogenic bacteria. The authors selected the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus as pathogen model due to its enormous clinical relevance and broad repertoire of toxins. This bacterium is a prototypic antibiotics-resistant pathogen and is also associated with the development of allergic immune responses in diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. For their research, they used different experimental S. aureus infection models in combination with genetic approaches and in vitro mast cell models to reveal the functions of selected components of IgE effector mechanisms.

The scientists found that mice with a mild S. aureus skin infection develop an adaptive immune response and specific IgEs antibodies against bacterial components. This immune response grants these mice an increased resistance when they are confronted with a severe secondary lung or skin and soft tissue infection. However, mice that are lacking functional IgE effector mechanisms or mast cells are unable to build such protection. These findings indicate that the ""allergic"" immune response against bacteria is not pathological, but instead protective. Hence, defense against toxin-producing pathogenic bacteria might be an important biological function of the ""allergy module.""

This study is an important collaboration initiated by Philipp Starkl at the laboratory of Stephen J. Galli at Stanford University together with other colleagues and then continued at the laboratory of Sylvia Knapp at CeMM and the Medical University of Vienna. This exciting discovery not only advances the general understanding of the immune system and most notably allergic immune responses, but it could also explain why the body has maintained the ""allergy module"" throughout evolution. Despite their dangerous contributions to allergic diseases, IgEs and mast cells can exert beneficial functions that the immune system can capitalize on to protect the body against venoms and infections with toxin-producing bacteria, such as S. aureus.",0

190,"Oct. 20, 2022 – Clarissa Ghazi gets lye relaxers, which contain the chemical sodium hydroxide, applied to her hair two to three times a year. A recent study that made headlines over a potential link between hair straighteners and uterine cancer is not going to make her stop. “This study is not enough to cause me to say I'll stay away from this because [the researchers] don’t prove that using relaxers causes cancer,” Ghazi says. Indeed, primary care doctors are unlikely to address the increased risk of uterine cancer in women who frequently use hair straighteners that the study reported. Among frequent users of hair straighteners -- meaning those who used them more than four times a year -- the researchers found that women were 2.55 times more likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer than those who never used these products. In the recently published paper on this research, the authors say that they found an 80% higher adjusted risk of uterine cancer among women who had ever “straightened,” “relaxed,” or used “hair pressing products” in the 12 months before enrolling in their study. This finding is “real, but small,” says internist Douglas S. Paauw, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. Paauw is among several primary care doctors interviewed for this story who expressed little concern about the implications of this research for their patients. “Since we have hundreds of things we are supposed to discuss at our 20-minute clinic visits, this would not make the cut,” Paauw says. While it’s good to be able to answer questions a patient might ask about this new research, the study does not prove anything, he says. Alan Nelson, MD, an internist-endocrinologist and former special advisor to the CEO of the American College of Physicians, says while the study is well done, the number of actual cases of uterine cancer found were small. One of the reasons he would not recommend discussing the study with patients is that the brands of hair products used to straighten hair in the study were not identified.

Alexandra White, PhD, lead author of the study, said participants were simply asked, “In the past 12 months, how frequently have you or someone else straightened or relaxed your hair, or used hair pressing products?” The terms “straightened,” “relaxed,” and “hair pressing products” were not defined, and “some women may have interpreted the term ‘pressing products’ to mean non-chemical products” such as flat irons, says White, who is also head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences’ Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group, in an email. Dermatologist Crystal Aguh, MD, associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, tweeted the following advice in light of the new findings: “The overall risk of uterine cancer is quite low so it's important to remember that. For now, if you want to change your routine, there's no downside to decreasing your frequency of hair straightening to every 12 weeks or more, as that may lessen your risk.” She also noted that “styles like relaxer, silk pressing and keratin treatments should only be done by a professional, as this will decrease the likelihood of hair damage and scalp irritation.” “I also encourage women to look for hair products free of parabens and phthalates (which are generically listed as ""fragrance"") on products to minimize exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals.” Ghazi says she decided to stop using keratin straighteners years ago after she learned they are made with several added ingredients. That includes the chemical formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, according to the American Cancer Society. “People have been relaxing their hair for a very long time, and I feel more comfortable using [a relaxer] to straighten my hair than any of the others out there,” Ghazi says. Janaki Ram, who has had her hair chemically straightened several times, says the findings have not made her worried that straightening will cause her to get uterine cancer specifically, but that they are a reminder that the chemicals in these products could harm her in some other way. She says the new study findings, her knowledge of the damage straightening causes to hair, and the lengthy amount of time receiving a keratin treatment takes will lead her to reduce the frequency with which she gets her hair straightened.

“Going forward, I will have this done once a year instead of twice a year,” she says. White, the author of the study, says in an interview that the takeaway for consumers is that women who reported frequent use of hair straighteners/relaxers and pressing products were over twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to women who reported no use of these products in the previous year. “However, uterine cancer is relatively rare, so these increases in risks are small,” she says. “Less frequent use of these products was not as strongly associated with risk, suggesting that decreasing use may be an option to reduce harmful exposure. Black women were the most frequent users of these products and therefore these findings are more relevant for Black women.” “We estimated that 1.64% of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70; but for frequent users, that risk goes up to 4.05%,” White says in a statement. “One of the original aims of the study was to better understand the environmental and genetic causes of breast cancer, but we are also interested in studying ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and many other cancers and chronic diseases,” White says in an interview.",0

• Researchers report that the immunotherapy drug Opdivo was effective against an advanced form of skin cancer in a clinical trial involving older adults.
• They said the drug boosted the immune system response against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
• Experts say immunotherapy is showing promise in treating a variety of cancers.

The immunotherapy drug, nivolumab (Opdivo), can boost the body’s immune response against advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

That’s the conclusion of a published today in Cancer, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

In it, researchers said that people with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma could benefit from the nivolumab. They said the phase 2 clinical trial showed robust anti-tumor activity with relatively minor side effects over a sustained period.

For the study, 24 participants received 3mg/kg of nivolumab intravenously every two weeks until they experienced cancer progression, developed unacceptable toxicity, or received 12 months of treatment. Participants had a median age of 74.

The results of the trial reported that 14 participants benefitted from the treatment and one person discontinued the therapy because of toxicity.

“This is the first study to investigate nivolumab in this patient population and it provides further evidence supporting the use of immune checkpoint blockers as standard therapies in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,” wrote Dr. Rodrigo R. Munhoz, a lead study author and an oncologist at the Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Brazil.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two other immunotherapy drugs for skin cancer – cemiplimab (Libtayo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda).

“Around 30 to 50 percent of the patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma respond to the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1 based on currently available data across different studies,” said Dr. Guilherme Rabinowits, a medical oncologist with Baptist Health Miami Cancer Institute in Florida.

“Patients without a history of immunosuppression, autoimmune disorders, solid organ, or a hematological transplant were not included in the clinical trials that led to the approval of immunotherapy, and data is still evolving on the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy on these patient populations,” Rabinowits told Healthline.

“Additionally, many patients do not respond to therapy. Careful discussion of potential risks and benefits of immunotherapy must be done with each patient before treatment initiation,” he added.",0
198,"UC Davis researchers have found that combining a Western-style high-fat diet with antibiotic use significantly increases the risk of developing pre-inflammatory bowel disease (pre-IBD). The study, published July 14 in Cell Host and Microbe, suggests that this combination shuts down the energy factories (mitochondria) in cells of the colon lining, leading to gut inflammation.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 11% of people worldwide. It is characterized by recurring episodes of abdominal pain, bloating and changes in bowel habits. IBS patients with mucosal inflammation and changes in the gut's microbial composition are considered pre-IBD.

The study included 43 healthy adults and 49 adult patients diagnosed with IBS. The researchers measured fecal calprotectin, a biomarker for intestinal inflammation, of participants. Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin indicated a pre-IBD condition. The study identified 19 patients with IBS as pre-IBD.

The researchers found that all participants who consumed high-fat diet and used antibiotics were at 8.6 times higher risk for having pre-IBD than those on low-fat diet and no recent history of antibiotic use. Participants with the highest fat consumption were about 2.8 times more likely to have pre-IBD than those with the lowest fat intake. A history of recent antibiotic usage alone was associated with 3.9 times higher likelihood of having pre-IBD.

""Our study found that a history of antibiotics in individuals consuming a high-fat diet was associated with the greatest risk for pre-IBD,"" said Andreas Bäumler, professor of medical microbiology and immunology and lead author on the study. ""Until now, we didn't appreciate how different environmental risk factors can synergize to drive the disease.""

Using mouse models, the study also tested the effect of high-fat diet and antibiotics use on the cells in the intestinal lining. It found that high-fat diet and antibiotics cooperate to disrupt the work of the cell's mitochondria, shutting its ability to burn oxygen. This disruption causes reduction in cell's oxygen consumption and leads to oxygen leakage into the gut.

The body's beneficial bacteria thrive in environments lacking oxygen such as the large intestine. Higher oxygen levels in the gut promote bacterial imbalances and inflammation. With the disruption in the gut environment, a vicious cycle of replacing the good bacteria with potentially harmful proinflammatory microbes that are more oxygen tolerant begins. This in turn leads to mucosal inflammation linked to pre-IBD conditions.

The study also identified 5-aminosalicylate (mesalazine), a drug that restarts the energy factories in the intestinal lining, as a potential treatment for pre-IBD.

""The best approach to a healthy gut is to get rid of the preferred sustenance of harmful microbes,"" Lee said. ""Our study emphasized the importance of avoiding high fat food and abuse of antibiotics to avoid gut inflammation.""

200,"The words that researchers use to describe their results can be harnessed to discover potential new treatments for Parkinson's disease, according to a new study publishing March 2 in the open access journal PLOS Biology by Angus McQuibban of the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues. The study employed an artificial intelligence (AI) system to identify an existing anti-cholesterol drug that has the ability to promote disposal of mitochondria, energy-making components of the cell which are damaged in the disease.

The full pathogenic pathway leading to Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, but one clear contributor is mitochondrial dysfunction and the inability to dispose of defective mitochondria, a process called mitophagy. At least five genes implicated in PD are linked to impaired mitophagy, either directly or indirectly, and so the authors sought compounds that could enhance the mitophagy process.

Several such compounds have been identified, but most of them also cause harm to cells, ruling them out as drug candidates. That led the authors to ask whether the literature describing these compounds might lead them to other compounds, ones not previously linked to mitophagy enhancement but which are described with terms that also appear in papers that discuss the known enhancers.

Identifying patterns of such ""semantic similarity"" is one of the core skills of IBM Watson for Drug Discovery, an AI program run on a supercomputer that analyzes the published literature for patterns of key words, phrases, and juxtapositions. The team used the program to develop a semantic ""fingerprint"" of bona fide mitophagy enhancers, and then looked for similar fingerprints in the literature on a set of over three thousand candidates from a drug database.

The top 79 candidates were screened in cell culture against a mitochondrial poison. The three top candidates from that assay were then tested on several other mitophagy assays, which identified probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, as the compound with the best combination of effectiveness and likely safety. Probucol was also found to improve motor function, survival, and neuron loss in two different animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD is primarily a movement disorder).

Probucol's effect on mitophagy required the formation and action of lipid droplets, transient cell structures that help maintain mitochondrial integrity during stress, and that accumulate abnormally in Parkinson's disease. Probucol is known to target ABCA1, a protein involved in lipid transport, and reduction in levels of ABCA1 reduced probucol's ability to promote mitophagy, suggesting that ABCA1 is a likely mediator of the role of lipid droplets in mitophagy.

""Our study showcased a dual in silico/cell-based screening methodology that identified known and new mechanisms leading to mitophagy enhancement,"" McQuibban said. ""Given the linkage between lipid droplet accumulation and ABCA1, it seems likely that probucol enhances mitophagy through mobilization of lipid droplets. Targeting this mechanism may be advantageous.""

McQuibban adds, ""In our study we used the AI-platform IBM Watson to efficiently identify currently approved drugs that could potentially be re-purposed as therapies for Parkinson's disease.""",0
201,"The various manifestations of head and neck carcinomas rank sixth in frequency worldwide and are fatal for about half a million people every year. In a quarter of cases, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, currently, is not always treatable. A research team led by Lorenz Kadletz-Wanke from MedUni Vienna's Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery has now discovered a new therapeutic option in the context of a study.

In the course of their investigations, the researchers were able to identify a protein that can be used to predict above-average survival of patients with HPV-positive head and neck carcinoma and to achieve progress in treatment. Specifically, this involves the Creb-binding protein (CBP), which controls various cellular programs and plays a role in carcinogenesis, among other things. As the study shows, CBP is much more active in HPV-induced head and neck tumours.

The most common triggers of head and neck tumours continue to be alcohol consumption and smoking. That said, human papillomavirus infections have increasingly been identified as the cause of HNSCC in recent years. Patients with HPV-positive head and neck tumours have so far been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This standard method acts systemically, i.e. on the whole body, is often accompanied by serious side effects such as hair loss, nausea and anemia, and not all patients respond to it. In the search for targeted treatments, the interdisciplinary research group studied the tissue of patients with HPV-positive HNSCC tumours histologically and in preclinical models. In the process, they not only discovered the protein CBP as a prognostic marker for above-average patient survival but also found that HPV-positive HNSCC cell models in particular can be effectively treated with a CBP inhibitor.

CBP inhibitors are drugs currently in development and may be available within the next few years. ""For patients with HPV-positive head and neck carcinoma, treatment with CBP inhibitors has the advantage that it can be targeted, rather than affecting the whole body. It is also better tolerated than conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy and this would significantly improve the quality of life of those affected,"" says study leader Lorenz Kadletz-Wanke, summarising the key finding of the research, which was conducted at MedUni Vienna's Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery in collaboration with Lukas Kenner (MedUni Vienna's Department of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Animal Pathology at Vetmeduni Vienna) and Stefan Stoiber (MedUni Vienna's Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy).",0

203,"The Human Genome Project is awarded the Thai 2017 Prince Mahidol Award for the field of medicine

The Human Genome Project has been awarded the 2017 Prince Mahidol Award for ground-breaking advances in the field of medicine. The award will be received on behalf of the project by Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the institute responsible for leading NIH’s effort in the project.

The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, was an international, collaborative research program aimed at the complete mapping and sequencing of the human genome. Its overarching goal was to provide researchers with fundamental information about the human genome and powerful tools for understanding the genetic factors in human disease, paving the way for new strategies for disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

“I am honored to be accepting this award on behalf of the thousands of dedicated scientists around the world who helped to make the Human Genome Project a remarkable success,” said Dr. Green who, before becoming the director of NHGRI, was a “start-to-finish” researcher in the Human Genome Project. “The resulting human genome sequence has provided a foundation on which researchers and clinicians now tackle increasingly complex problems, transforming the study of human biology and disease. Particularly gratifying has been the ability to begin using genomics to improve approaches for diagnosing and treating human disease, ushering in the era of genomic medicine.”

The Thai royal family is awarding its two annual prizes in Bangkok, Thailand, in late January 2018 – given in recognition of advances in public health and medicine – through the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation under the Royal Patronage. This foundation was established in 1992 to honor the late Prince Mahidol of Songkla, the Royal Father of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand and the Royal Grandfather of the present King. Prince Mahidol is celebrated worldwide as the father of modern medicine and public health in Thailand.

In addition to the award given in the field of medicine, the 2017 winners in the field of public health are scientists who worked towards improving the vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae type b, also known as Hib, the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among U.S. children under the age of 5. The winners of the award are Rachel Schneerson, M.D., and John Robbins, M.D., who headed a research team while they were scientists at the Eunice Kennedy Shiver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also part of NIH; Porter Anderson, Ph.D., from Harvard University and the University of Rochester in New York; and Mathuram Santosham, M.D., from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.

“We are profoundly grateful to the country of Thailand and its leaders for recognizing that advances in medicine and public health are important to society and thus worthy of recognition,” said Dr. Green. “Honoring the Human Genome Project and the development of an Hib vaccine with the Prince Mahidol Award signifies Thailand’s appreciation of, and commitment to, advancing human health.”

NHGRI is devoted to advancing health through genome research. The institute led NIH's contribution to the Human Genome Project, which was successfully completed in 2003 ahead of schedule and under budget. Building on the foundation laid by the sequencing of the human genome, NHGRI's work now encompasses a broad range of research aimed at expanding understanding of human biology and improving human health. In addition, a critical part of NHGRI's mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications of genome research.

204,"Dengue is the most widespread mosquito-borne disease in the world, and to date, there are no medical treatments for people suffering from this disease. The virus causes symptoms ranging from high fevers to severe bleeding and shock, can be life-threatening, and presents an enormous burden on health systems.

In Chaos, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Spain, Portugal, and Colombia developed a model the virus. In 2009, researchers discovered mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia bacteria lessen the chances for the dengue virus to impact humans.

Mosquitoes do not acquire Wolbachia bacteria in their natural environment, however. This bacterium must be introduced in vitro in mosquitoes' eggs, which are later released in areas affected by dengue transmission. Mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia naturally take over the local mosquito population.

The researchers use real data on human and vector activity in a framework that can be analyzed from a mathematical point of view, allowing them to re-create and understand the epidemiological situation. In this way, they can identify those geographical areas with the greatest vulnerability, creating a ranking of areas that prioritizes those where Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes can have the strongest and most beneficial impact on the spread of the dengue virus.

""One might think that the most populated areas are those in which Wolbachia release would be most beneficial. However, this is not always true,"" said co-author Jesus Gomez-Gardenes, from Universidad del Valle in Colombia.

The authors found once they immunize the most vulnerable geographical area, the ranking of the remaining areas is affected, giving rise to a new scenario that tells them where they should concentrate resources in the second instance and beyond.

The findings from this research will be beneficial to many groups, such as the World Mosquito Program, which is currently releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to protect the global community from diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika.

In these kinds of initiatives, the information about the most vulnerable areas within cities or regions proved the researchers' model could complement field studies to find targets that maximize the benefit for the whole community.

""Data-driven models have also proven useful to tackle the evolution and mitigation of other diseases such as COVID-19,"" said Gomez-Gardenes. ""Hopefully, the framework developed for dengue can be further generalized for tackling the control of other vector-borne diseases.""",0

214,"Philadelphia, PA) – Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have discovered that a molecule found in liver cells is an important link in explaining the relationship among diet, lipid levels in blood, and atherosclerosis. The research team surmises that drugs targeted at the liver may one day help lower elevated lipids and battle cardiovascular disease. Mitchell Lazar, MD, PhD, Director of the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism at Penn, and colleagues report their findings in the May 2005 issue of Cell Metabolism.

The high-cholesterol, high-fat so-called “Western diet” has accelerated an epidemic of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. And, understanding interactions between genes and the reality of what most people eat are increasingly recognized as critical for effective treatment.

Molecules found in the nucleus of liver cells called LXRs (for Liver X Receptors) have emerged in the last few years as crucial regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. (Click on thumbnail to view full-size image). “The conventional wisdom–borne out of drug-development studies done before this paper–was that LXRs are good in terms of decreasing atherosclerosis and bad in terms of increased triglycerides,” explains Lazar. Indeed, although LXR-based experimental drugs, which dramatically increase LXR activity throughout the body, reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, they also lead to high levels of triglycerides.

Surmising that a targeted approach might work better, the researchers used transgenic mice engineered to have an excess of LXR in their liver only, which gave the mice high levels of cholesterol and an increased risk of heart disease. They found that LXR, which senses fat in the liver, could adjust the consequences of eating a high-fat Western diet.

The team found that the increased liver LXR worsened levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in mice fed a normal, low-fat diet. However, surprisingly, when the same transgenic mice with increased LXR were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet, similar in composition to a standard Western diet, their blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels actually improved. Furthermore, the mice were protected from the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that normally results from this diet. However, the beneficial effect of the increased LXR levels was lost when mice were treated with the experimental drug.

The researchers concluded that increased expression of LXR in the liver is beneficial in a body full of natural molecules that bind to the LXR receptor, which are generated by the Western diet, but not when on a low-fat, healthy diet. However, this benefit is lost when a potent drug is added to the system. “The reason is that a different set of target genes is turned on by this synthetic molecule, as opposed to the natural molecule,” says Lazar. “We’re saying, maybe what we need are drugs that mimic the natural ligand rather than a sledgehammer like the potent pharmaceutical drugs that too powerfully activate LXRs throughout the body.” The hope is that these will decrease cholesterol without increasing triglycerides.

One of the main questions facing the study of complex metabolic diseases is, if two people eat a high-fat diet, why does one person’s cholesterol go up but the other’s does not. “If we find natural variations in people in the amount of LXR in their livers, this may help explain this conundrum of the difference in susceptibility to high cholesterol and heart disease, depending on diet,” says Lazar. “The answer is genetics. Our work suggests that one of the new genetic factors to pay attention to is the amount of LXR in the liver.”

The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and a Bristol Myers Squibb Freedom to Discover Award in Metabolic Research. Study co-authors are Michael Lehrke, Corinna Lebherz, Segan Millington, Hong-Ping Guan, John Millar, Daniel J. Rader, and James M. Wilson, all from Penn.",0

Beginning this week, many patients in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area who otherwise would need to be hospitalized will be able to receive in-person and virtual care through Mayo Clinic's advanced care at home platform.

Under 24/7 direction of Mayo Clinic physicians, advanced care at home provides services such as skilled nursing, medications and infusions, as well as laboratory, imaging and rehabilitation services from nurses, paramedics and support team members. The model of care, launched by Mayo Clinic Platform and operated by Mayo Clinic's Center for Digital Health, provides a secure and seamless experience at home, combining technology and clinical expertise to ensure that the needs of the patient come first.

Mayo Clinic introduced advanced care at home in the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Jacksonville, Florida, areas in July 2020. ""Mayo Clinic's advanced care at home model has shown its value and has been well-received by patients in Wisconsin and Florida,"" says Chad Nelson, M.D., chair of the Division of Hospital Internal Medicine in Arizona. ""Whether the patient is receiving care at Mayo Clinic Hospital or at home with our advanced care at home model, we deliver patient-centered care that meets each person's unique needs."" Dr. Nelson is medical director for advanced care at home in Arizona.

Mayo Clinic is partnering with Medically Home, a Boston-based technology-enabled services company, to offer advanced care at home in Arizona, as it has in Florida and Wisconsin. In May, Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente announced strategic investments in Medically Home Group to expand access to this unique model of care and encourage providers to adopt it.

""Providing medical care at home is not a new thing – 150 years ago, Dr. William W. Mayo was making house calls and providing at-home care, for example – but with advanced technology and the ability to create a virtual hospital at home, with around-the-clock supervision, we can provide individualized care for our patients in the comfort of their homes,"" says Michael Maniaci, M.D., chair of the Division of Hospital Internal Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Florida. ""We're pleased to offer the convenience and Mayo Clinic expertise available through advanced care at home to patients in the Phoenix area."" Dr. Maniaci is the enterprise physician leader for advanced care at home at Mayo Clinic.

Medically Home enables health care providers to offer high-acuity care that is typically provided in traditional hospital settings safely in a patient's home. Its integrated technology platform and network of in-home services allow care to be directed around the clock by Mayo Clinic physicians and providers, with real-time remote clinical monitoring and video access for patients and their care teams.

Another factor in the growth of Mayo Clinic's advanced care at home model has been greater regulatory flexibility accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill passed by the Arizona Legislature to expand telehealth coverage. The legislation established a pilot program administered by the Arizona Department of Health Services to allow health systems to provide hospital at-home services, such as Mayo Clinic's advanced care at home model of care.

Advanced care at home provides a network of 18 rapid-response support services, a clinical command center and a care response team to provide seamless hospital-level care at home.

""We are delighted to partner with Mayo Clinic to enable the expansion of this important capability as they continue to be a leader in the decentralization of high-acuity care for serious or complex patients across the country,"" says Rami Karjian, CEO of Medically Home. ""We are excited that Mayo Clinic patients in Arizona now will be able to experience the improvement in satisfaction and outcomes that comes with this expansion. We applaud the Arizona governor, legislature, and Department of Health Services for not only supporting this important program during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also ensuring it will be available to Arizonans for many years past the pandemic.""

VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem, but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine. This way, VAERS can provide CDC and FDA with valuable information that additional work and evaluation is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern.

223,"A new study reveals that approximately 1 in 5 individuals may experience mental health symptoms up to six months after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), suggesting the importance of follow-up care for these patients. Scientists also identified factors that may increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or major depressive disorder following mild mTBI or concussion through analysis of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study cohort. The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. The findings were published in JAMA Psychiatry.

“Mental health disorders after concussion have been studied primarily in military populations, and not much is known about these outcomes in civilians,” said Patrick Bellgowan, Ph.D., NINDS program director. “These results may help guide follow-up care and suggest that doctors may need to pay particular attention to the mental state of patients many months after injury.”

In the study, Murray B. Stein, M.D., M.P.H., professor at the University of California San Diego, and his colleagues investigated mental health outcomes in 1,155 people who had experienced a mild TBI and were treated in the emergency department. At three, six, and 12 months after injury, study participants completed various questionnaires related to PTSD and major depressive disorder. For a comparison group, the researchers also surveyed individuals who had experienced orthopedic traumatic injuries, such as broken legs, but did not have head injury.

The results showed that at three and six months following injury, people who had experienced mTBI were more likely than orthopedic trauma patients to report symptoms of PTSD and/or major depressive disorder. For example, three months after injury, 20 percent of mTBI patients reported mental health symptoms compared to 8.7 percent of orthopedic trauma patients. At six months after injury, mental health symptoms were reported by 21.2 percent of people who had experienced head injury and 12.1 percent of orthopedic trauma patients.

Dr. Stein and his team also used the data to determine risk factors for PTSD and major depressive disorder after mTBI. The findings revealed that lower levels of education, self-identifying as African-American, and having a history of mental illness increased risk. In addition, if the head injury was caused by an assault or other violent attack, that increased the risk of developing PTSD, but not major depressive disorder. However, risk of mental health symptoms was not associated with other injury-related occurrences such as duration of loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia.

“Contrary to common assumptions, mild head injuries can cause long-term effects. These findings suggest that follow-up care after head injury, even for mild cases, is crucial, especially for patients showing risk factors for PTSD or depression,” said Dr. Stein.

This study is part of the NIH-funded TRACK-TBI initiative, which is a large, long-term study of patients treated in the emergency department for mTBI. The goal of the study is to improve understanding of the effects of concussions by establishing a comprehensive database of clinical measures including brain images, blood samples, and outcome data for 3,000 individuals, which may help identify biomarkers of TBI, risk factors for various outcomes, and improve our ability to identify and prevent adverse outcomes of head injury. To date, more than 2,700 individuals have enrolled in TRACK-TBI.

A recent study coming out of TRACK-TBI suggested that many TBI patients were not receiving recommended follow-up care.

“TRACK-TBI is overturning many of our long-held beliefs around mTBI, particularly in what happens with patients after they leave the emergency department. We are seeing more evidence about the need to monitor these individuals for many months after their injury to help them achieve the best recovery possible,” said Geoff Manley, M.D., professor at the University of California San Francisco, senior author of the current study and principal investigator of TRACK-TBI.

Future research studies will help identify mental health conditions, other than PTSD and major depressive disorder, that may arise following mTBI. In addition, more research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms that lead from mTBI to mental health problems and other adverse outcomes, such as neurological and cognitive difficulties.

228,"Actor Matthew McConaughey has promoted the effectiveness of the hair treatment Regenix for two decades. 

Alejandro Cegarra/Bloomberg via Getty Images
• Actor Matthew McConaughey has promoted his use of Regenix for hair growth for more than two decades.
• The company says Regenix utilizes vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts to build a customized hair growth product for customers.
• Some experts, however, say there’s no solid evidence that Regenix works as well as the company says it does.
• They also note that hair growth products should only be used by people with thinning hair and not people who are experiencing baldness or other more serious hair growth issues. Besides being a highly successful actor, Matthew McConaughey makes a living as a celebrity spokesperson, from Lincoln cars to Wild Turkey whiskey to beef, being the new face of telling people, “It’s what’s for dinner.” But one of McConaughey’s longest endorsements — Regenix — is making headlines because he attributes the hair regrowing system with giving his locks new life, something he reportedly opines on in his new memoir. As far back as 2001 during an appearance on “The Late Show” when David Letterman was still the host, McConaughey said he was able to regrow his hair, using his trademark Texas twang to sound out “Re-gen-ix.” More recently, Regenix’s CEO Bill Edwards told celebrity news site TMZ that McConaughey had been a customer since 1999 and his endorsement helped the company transition to a fully mail-order service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither Edwards nor McConaughey said whether that endorsement is paid, but Edwards told TMZ that neither McConaughey nor his friends need to pay for their treatments. Edwards said in a 2020 blog entry on Medium that he would always be grateful for McConaughey’s “straightforward honesty about using Regenix” because their other celebrity clients, whose privacy he keeps, aren’t so forward. McConaughey — who won a best actor Oscar in 2014 for his role in “Dallas Buyers Club” portraying a person trying to obtain lifesaving experimental medication during the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic — recently told the LAD Bible he’s still talking about Regenix because a Beverly Hills, California, doctor claims to have given him hair plugs, a report he said isn’t true.

According to its website, Regenix uses “natural biopharmaceuticals — vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts from citrus and chamomile to tea tree oil and Aragon” and the personalized formulations are “drug-free, chemical-free, which means no side effects.” “The ingredients are naturally derived,” Regenix’s FAQ page says. “We have thousands of potential combinations, but the formula is tailored to you because no two scalps are alike.” Here’s how Regenix works: Potential customers send in a few hair samples and answer a survey. Regenix then creates a tailored regimen of drug-free shampoos, conditioners, and other topical solutions, telling customers they could see results in as little as 8 months.

Much like traditional herbal and nutritional supplements, Regenix isn’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With that in mind, is there any proof that Regenix is as effective as something like Propecia or other more scrutinized hair replacement methods? Despite its website saying Regenix is “rooted in science” and stating it’s helped more than half a million people with “hair and scalp issues,” the company offers no proof of how it works, if it does, or even what ingredients, specifically, are in the tailored treatments. In addition, Medical News Today reported last fall that there’s no solid evidence to support this particular treatment actually works. Dr. Ken L. Williams Jr., a surgeon and founder of Orange County Hair Restoration in California, said he respects McConaughey for his acting talents, “but he is not a medical doctor.” Regenix, Williams said, uses marketing practices that feed off of people’s emotional responses to hair loss. He said Regenix doesn’t use physician-dispensed medication or oversight in its treatment plan and provides “no accurate diagnosis.” “This treatment is not FDA-approved and currently lacks research or proven medicinal applications,” Williams told Healthline. “It consists of topical products such as a shampoo, conditioner, an unrecognized, poorly described or understood ‘deep follicle cleanser.’” Williams also said Regenix uses saw palmetto, which “has no proven application for hair loss” and the “hair analysis kit” has “no practical or clinical application in the diagnosis of hair loss disorders.” Williams said people experiencing hair loss need to be properly examined and diagnosed by a hair restoration surgeon or dermatologist and rely on proven treatments, such as Minoxidil or Rogaine, Propecia, or Finasteride, laser light therapy, or regenerative procedures, such as platelet rich plasma. Nonetheless, Dr. Jae Pak, a Los Angeles, California-based hair restoration specialist, said that some research shows that lavender and biotin can stimulate the hair follicles, so treatments such as Regenix could have the potential to help people restore their hair. “It’s not a far cry to say their product provides real results,” Pak told Healthline. “Most mega-celebrities like Matthew McConaughey are not willing to put their name behind a product unless it is something they truly believe in.”",0

230,"June 3, 2022 -- A California woman who pretended to have cancer and received more than $100,000 in charitable donations from hundreds of people has been sentenced to 5 years in prison.

Amanda Christine Riley pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud for soliciting donations from people through various social media sites to help pay for cancer treatments that she never received or needed, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

In total, the government identified 349 individuals and entities who made contributions totaling $105,513. Riley was sentenced to 60 months in prison on May 3.

Riley is hardly the first person to fake a cancer diagnosis for money. In fact, the phenomenon of faking illness online now occurs so often that researchers have given it a name: ""Munchausen by Internet."" However, few appear to be penalized with prison time.

In this case, the scam began in 2012, when Riley falsely claimed to have been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a blog to document her imaginary condition and ""aggressively"" solicit donations to cover her supposed medical expenses, the DOJ said.",0
231,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects 'plasma cells', a type of immune cell found in the bone marrow. This cancer can weaken the immune system, cause kidney damage, and weaken bones, which may lead to fractures. Average survival rates have improved considerably thanks to new treatment options. These include lenalidomide and pomalidomide, drugs which are often successful in forcing the cancer into remission. In nearly all cases, however, the cancer will become increasingly less susceptible to these drugs, meaning it develops drug resistance. When cancer growth eventually resumes despite treatment, the patient's prognosis is poor.

Using latest improvements for a method known as proteomics, an interdisciplinary team of researchers in Berlin was able to decode a previously unknown mechanism which can cause this type of relapse. ""We were able to show that production of CDK6, a cell division-promoting cell cycle regulator, is particularly high once the cancer has become resistant to treatment,"" explains one of the study's two co-leads, Prof. Dr. Jan Krönke of the Department of Hematology, Oncology and Cancer Immunology on Campus Benjamin Franklin. ""Based on our data, we believe that CDK6 inhibition could represent a new treatment approach in relapsed multiple myeloma.""

Despite extensive DNA sequencing studies, treatment resistance in multiple myeloma has only rarely been linked to changes at the genetic level, such as gene mutations or gene deletions. ""This suggests that the changes taking place within the cancer cell which would explain this relapse must take place at a different level,"" says the study's second co-lead, Dr. Philipp Mertins, an MDC researcher who heads the Proteomics Platform at both the MDC and the BIH. He continues: ""The cancer cells' growth potential may also be subject to various means of control at the protein level. Here, we observed this type of effect in relation to the protein CDK6."" The researchers employed cutting-edge mass spectrometry technology in order to establish whether changes at the protein level are responsible for the cancer becoming resistant to treatment. Using both pre- and post-relapse samples from patients with multiple myeloma, the researchers were able to quantify more than 6,000 different proteins.

Comparing cancer cells collected before and after relapse, the researchers found that a range of proteins were present at either higher or lower concentrations post-relapse. Using statistical and bioninformatics analyses, the researchers were able to trace the majority of these effects back to a single protein: cyclin-dependent kinase 6, or CDK6, an enzyme which controls the cell's entry into the cell division phase of the cell cycle.

As a first step, the researchers used cell cultures to demonstrate that CDK6 plays a key role in the development of treatment resistance in multiple myeloma. ""When we artificially increased the amount of CDK6 present inside cultured myeloma cells, they lost their susceptibility to the drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide,"" explains the study's first author, Dora Ng, a researcher at the Department of Hematology, Oncology and Cancer Immunology on Campus Benjamin Franklin. She adds: ""However, when we also added a CDK6 inhibitor, the drugs became effective again and the cancer cells died. This shows that CDK6 inhibition enables at least a partial reversal of the myeloma cells' treatment resistance.""

The researchers were then able to confirm this effect in an animal model, where the combination of pomalidomide with a CDK6 inhibitor significantly improved the odds of survival. ""These data suggest that patients with treatment-resistant multiple myeloma may also benefit from the addition of CDK6 inhibitors,"" says Prof. Krönke, a researcher at the German Cancer Consortium's (DKTK) translational research center in Berlin, who is being funded via the DFG's Emmy Noether Program. ""Further studies will be needed in order to test this hypothesis. One advantage is that some CDK6 inhibitors have already been authorized for use in the treatment of breast cancer.""

The study's second first author, Dr. Evelyn Ramberger, was responsible for performing the project's protein analyses. A postdoc at Charité and the MDC/BIH Proteomics Platform, she is convinced that the technology holds enormous benefits for the field of cancer research: ""We want to continue pursuing this new approach of using modern, comprehensive protein analyses to study cancer tissues -- both in multiple myeloma and other cancers. We hope this will unveil further treatment targets and biomarkers for use in personalized cancer medicine,"" she says.",0
232,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Colorectal cancer outcomes may improve by genetically altering an immune-regulatory protein in cancer cells, making the cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy. That's according to new Mayo Clinic research.

The findings, published this month in Oncogene, indicate that increasing the expression of the PD-L1 protein in colorectal cancer cells can improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.

""These findings, if verified by subsequent research, suggest that the level of tumor cell PD-L1 may be important in drug sensitivity and suggest that enhancing PD-L1 expression may be a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes in this malignancy,"" says Frank Sinicrope, M.D., a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist and gastroenterologist. Dr. Sinicrope is co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Mayo Clinic and corresponding author of the study.

PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein that interacts with another protein, PD-1, to negatively affect cell functions and enable tumor cells to evade the body's immune system. Research has shown that interrupting the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction can enhance attacks on anti-tumor immunity.

However, the Mayo Clinic study describes another function of PD-L1: its effect on proteins that regulate tumor cell death. Deleting the PD-L1 gene suppressed two proteins that are associated with increased chemotherapy-induced cell death. In contrast, restoring PD-L1 expression reversed the suppression of these proteins.

""We sought to determine the relevance of our findings for PD-L1 in patients with colorectal cancer,"" Dr. Sinicrope says. ""To do so, we utilized the Cancer Genome Atlas database of the National Cancer Institute to examine the association of PD-L1 expression with the survival of patients with colon cancer.""

The study found that increased tumor cell PD-L1 expression was associated with better survival among patients expected to have received chemotherapy, which is the standard of care for patients with stage 3 and stage 4 cancers, according to Dr. Sinicrope.

""This suggests a broader role for PD-L1 as a possible predictive biomarker for how patients will respond to cancer treatment, though more research is needed to address this issue,"" he says.

The study also found that the BRAF oncogene, a gene that can transform a cell into a cancer cell, can regulate the expression of PD-L1. When the BRAF oncogene is mutated, it can increase PD-L1 expression in colorectal cancer cells, according to the study.

""Current therapies targeting PD-L1 are mainly focused on blocking or disrupting its function in tumor cells,"" says Haidong Dong, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic tumor immunologist and co-author of the study. ""This work suggests that enhancement of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells may promote the efficacy of chemotherapy, at least in colon cancer. It is an idea-changing discovery that, if validated in clinical trials, would bring more benefit to patients with colon cancer that is resistant to current chemotherapy.""

The study, conducted by researchers at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Mayo Clinic in Florida, was supported in part by a grant from the National Cancer Institute. Co-author Daofu Feng, M.D., was supported by the Scientific Research Training Program for Young Talents of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in China. Co-author Lei Sun was supported by Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in Guangzhou, China.

249,"Researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine are looking for ways to heal wounds by using a healing protein that is active in fetuses, but largely inactive in adults and absent in diabetic adults.

""We already know from previous studies at other institutions that if a fetus is wounded, it can regenerate the tissue, or repair it to be like new,"" said Chandan K. Sen, PhD, associate vice president of military and applied research, the J. Stanley Battersby chair and distinguished professor of surgery and director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering at Indiana University School of Medicine. ""But after birth, such regenerative wound healing ability is lost. Healing in adults is relatively inefficient often associated with undesirable scar formation.""

In the study, published recently in Molecular Therapy, the team focused on a protein called nonselenocysteine-containing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, or NPGPx. NPGPx is active in fetal tissue but becomes mostly inactive in the skin after birth.

""Nature essentially hides this fetal regenerative repair pathway in the adult body,"" Sen said. ""We spotted its absence, and then activated it to improve healing of diabetic wounds.""

Researchers used tissue nanotransfection technology developed by faculty at the ICRME to deliver the NPGPx gene to the wound site. Diabetic wounds, which are complicated skin injuries in people with diabetes, are particularly difficult to treat and often lead to amputations or other complications because of how easily they can become infected.

""This is an exciting new approach to harness fetal repair mechanisms to close diabetic wounds in adults,"" Sen said. ""The study results show that while NPGPx has been known to be abundant in the fetal skin, but not after birth, it can be reactivated in the skin after an injury. We look forward to continued study aiming to achieve a more complete regenerative repair by improving our understanding of how NPGPx functions.""

In addition to Sen, study authors from IU include Subhadip Ghatak, PhD, Savita Khanna, PhD, Sashwati Roy, PhD, Mohamed El Masry, MD, PhD, Anu Sharma, PhD, Ravichand Palakurti, PhD, Yi Xuan, PhD, and Mervin Yoder, MD.

252,"Understanding of how neuronal activity modulates brain function is a key first step towards creating more effective drugs to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse, epilepsy, and others.

To both manipulate and understand this basic feature of neuronal biology, the lab of Bryan L. Roth, MD, PhD, the Michael Hooker Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology at the UNC School of Medicine, created a chemogenetic technology called DREADD -- designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs -- in the mid-2000s. Even though this technology is used ubiquitously in the neurosciences, why the technology was so efficient was unknown.

Now, as reported in the journal Nature, the Roth lab led by postdoctoral researcher Shicheng Zhang, PhD, used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the detailed, high resolution structures of four DREADDs bound to three drug-like but inert compounds.

This work, made possible through the UNC CryoEM Core Facility, reveals key details of DREADDs that should accelerate the structure-guided discovery of next-generation chemogenetic tools.

""Although DREADDs are widely used, the precise molecular basis for why they are so useful has been obscure until now,"" Zhang said. ""We think these structures will help scientists around the world, including here at UNC-Chapel Hill, investigate the development of more effective and safer therapeutics for a host of neuropsychiatric conditions.""

To study how brain cells function, scientists need to target specific neural circuits -- a network of interconnected cells that constantly send and receive electrical and chemical signals through receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors, which are the intended targets of many therapeutics. This, though, is no easy task, which is the main reason why many drugs strike several kinds of receptors or activate specific receptors in unintended ways. The result might be a beneficial therapeutic effect, but also side effects.

One way to make more sense of neuron biology is to use chemogenetic technologies. That's when scientists design receptor proteins that react only to a pharmacologically inert drug-like compound called a ligand, which will not cause a biochemical reaction in the body. Then, experimentally, scientists put that designed receptor into a specific type of neuron. When neurons start expressing the receptor, scientists add the ligand to activate or inhibit the neurons.

This is how scientists can study which receptors do what, and how they do it. When Roth's lab created DREADDs 15 years ago, scientists quickly adopted the useful technology. This is because researchers would express DREADDs in specific brain cells and then administer a drug-like compound to either activate or inhibit cells of living animals. Since 2007, DREADDs have been used world-wide by large numbers of scientists to identify brain cells which regulate perception, emotion, cognition, memory, sleep, and nearly every other known biological function mediated by the brain cells.

""Yet, we never fully understood why the drug-like compounds bound so specifically to these evolved designer receptors we had created,"" Roth said. ""In large measure, that's because we engineered the receptors before we elucidated their structures.""

For this Nature study, the Roth lab used cryogenic microscopy to determine the detailed chemical structure of the DREADDs hM3Dq-miniGq complex (which activates neurons) and the hM4Di-miniGo complex (which inhibits neurons) bound to the drug-like compound deschloroclozapine; the DREADD hM3Dq-miniGq complex bound to clozapine-N-oxide; and the DREADD hM3R-miniGq complex bound to iperoxo.

""This study provides precious and highly detailed molecular insights into the mechanisms responsible for the distinctive utility of DREADDs,"" Roth said.

258,"University Hospitals and Cleveland Clinic Partner to Provide Drive-Through COVID-19 Testing Drive-Through Screening for People with Doctor’s Orders to be Held at W.O. Walker Building in University Circle

Update on March 22, 2020:

 Drive-through testing hours at W.O. Walker Building have changed to 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week.

 Cleveland Clinic patients are now being screened at W.O. Walker Building and UH patients at UH Landerbrook Health Center. Cleveland Clinic is prioritizing high-risk patients for testing, which includes those who are age 61 and older. For patients 60 and under who already have a Cleveland Clinic physician’s order, we are asking they not report to the W.O. Walker testing facility until they are contacted by Cleveland Clinic with further instructions.

Published on March 13, 2020:

 Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals (UH) have partnered to provide drive-through COVID-19 testing for patients with an electronic doctor’s order from UH or Cleveland Clinic. The testing will begin at 11 a.m. on Saturday, March 14 for Cleveland Clinic patients and on Monday for UH patients. The testing site will be open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week.

The on-site testing will be located in the garage of the jointly-owned W. O. Walker Building in University Circle, 10524 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland. This collaboration propels the capability for rapid testing results to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in Northeast Ohio.

“The entire health care community is coming together by responding with tremendous unity, everyone is looking at us to do what is right, and we will,” said Tom Mihaljevic, M.D., President and CEO, Cleveland Clinic. “We are working together to optimize our preparations by standing together as a team to meet the demands of our patients, our families and our communities.”

“We are fortunate to live in an area where the health care institutions have a history of coming together for the greater good of the community,” said Thomas F. Zenty, III, CEO of University Hospitals. “Most recently we showcased this cooperation with our collective response to the region’s opioid epidemic and now we are joining forces again to ensure our neighbors receive necessary and timely care to address the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Patients without an electronic doctor’s order will not be offered testing at this location. To obtain a medical screening to determine testing necessity, people with symptoms should start with a virtual visit using Cleveland Clinic’s Express Care Online or call their UH or Cleveland Clinic primary care physician.

Upon arrival to the drive-through location, patients will stay in their car and present their doctor’s order. They will remain in their car as a sample is collected.

Samples collected from this location will be sent to UH and Cleveland Clinic laboratories. Performing testing on-site at local hospitals ensures faster results than sending the samples to the state or outside lab. Results are anticipated to be available within a day. Patients will be tested regardless of their ability to pay; no copays will be charged for the test.

Cleveland Clinic and UH are testing in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. As this situation changes, our procedures will continue to evolve.

Please continue to visit Cleveland Clinic’s website and UH’s website for updates on this rapidly evolving situation.",0

265,"Jan. 11, 2023 – As vice principal of Pennsville Middle School in New Jersey, Adam J. Slusher knows he’s not always going to be Mr. Popularity. Part of a vice principal’s job includes scheduling, enforcing policy, and discipline, so Slusher – who holds a doctorate in education from Wilmington University in Delaware – sometimes has to send emails or make phone calls that address unpleasant topics or unpopular new policies. But there was a much different reaction this past July, after Slusher sent a message to the homes of Pennsville’s 450 students spanning grades 6 to 8. The email blast announced a new cellphone policy for the school. Starting in September, as Slusher explained in the message – which also went out to the school’s 60 faculty and staff members – the use of cellphones by Pennsville students would be prohibited during school hours for any reason. Phones, he emphasized, “are to be turned OFF” and stowed away in backpacks or handbags, not carried or tucked into back pockets. The announcement of the new Away for the Day policy, which was decided upon by Slusher and Pennsville Principal Carolyn Carels, provoked a response different from those to his announcements on, say, test dates, emergency procedures, or new detention policies. “It was one of the most popular emails I’ve ever sent,” chuckled Slusher, who has been an educator for 17 years. “We’ve gotten so many thanks from teachers for this."" Ditto with the staff, who in conversations with Slusher and Carels had reported on the rampant use of phones in the cafeteria and hallways – confirming what both of them had seen. “They were telling us, ‘You’ve got to do something about the phones’” Slusher recalls. “They were delighted that a clear policy was now going to be in place."" The overwhelming majority of Pennsville parents have also supported the new policy, especially, when presented with some of the sobering evidence about the extent of phone use among this population. One study Slusher cited in his email showed that the average middle school child is spending between 6 and 9 hours a day on screens.

“That’s like a full-time job,” he says. The heavy cellphone use by kids – in school, out of school, anywhere and everywhere – was part of what prompted internal medicine doctor and filmmaker Delaney Ruston, MD, to create the “Away for the Day” initiative, which Pennsville has adopted. She and collaborator Lisa Tabb were driven to do ""Away for the Day"" while working on Screenagers, their award-winning 2016 film examining the impact of social media, videos, and screen time on youngsters and their families that also offered tips for better navigating the digital world. “Over 3 years of making the film, I was visiting schools all over the country,” Ruston says. “By the end, I was seeing devices all over the place, even in elementary schools. When I’d ask a student in the hall, ‘What’s the policy?’ they would shrug and say ‘I don’t know.’ When I got the same reaction from teachers – who in many cases were left to decide on their own, so that they had to be the bad guys – I realized there was a problem here."" The result was what Ruston and Tabb describe on their website as a “movement,” designed to provide tools to parents, teachers, and administrators to help them make policies that put phones away during the school day. As even a casual glance in the homeroom of every high school or college lecture hall will confirm, phone use is high in teenagers and young adults. But Ruston and Tabb decided to focus on middle schools. “That’s the age where we know schools are facing the most challenges,” Ruston says. “This is also the age when social centrality becomes a major focus for youth. Thus, the pull to be on social media games, where their peers are, is incredibly enticing.” Indeed: A recent study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found that middle schoolers who compulsively check social networks on their phones appear to have changes in areas of the brain linked to reward and punishment. It was in middle schools, she concluded, “where effective policies on cellphones are most needed.”

As part of their research into the issue, she and Tabb did a survey using email contacts collected by Ruston’s company, MyDoc Productions, during the making of the film, along with subscribers to her blog. A total of 1,200 parents – each of whom had at least one child in middle school at the time – were surveyed. The researchers found an interesting disconnect: 82% of the parents surveyed did not want their kids using phones in school. Yet 55% of middle schools allowed students to carry phones during the school day. That survey was done in 2017. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of cellphones by kids, both in school and at home, has risen dramatically. A literature review of 46 studies, published in JAMA Pediatrics in November, found that average screen time among children and adolescents has increased by 52% – or 84 minutes a day – during the pandemic. That trend has given many schools, including Pennsville, the drive to adopt an Away for the Day-type policy. As part of the program, Ruston’s website provides ammunition against the kinds of pushback they might expect to get. One of the most common is the idea that banning cellphone use among middle school children is a misguided, anti-technology measure. “We’re not at all anti-tech,” Ruston asserts. Away for the Day, she explains, advocates the use of learning technologies in school that are monitored and supervised by teachers. “The majority of students have access to learning devices in the school,” she says. “These have different kinds of blockers, making it harder for their kid to respond to their friend on TikTok when they’re supposed to be using technology for learning.” Ruston estimates that about 10,000 middle schools are now using various pieces of the Away for the Day campaign, which includes videos, posters, fact sheets, and other materials. Other schools have adopted similar measures in the same spirit. Predictable and Calm? Not So Much When Katherine Holden was named principal of Oregon’s Talent Middle School last year, one of the first things she wanted to do was create some structure for the routines of students (and parents) who were frazzled after 2 years of remote learning, staggered schedules, and mask mandates.

“Predictable and calm,” she says, with a laugh. “I use those words every day.” Achieving both is hard enough in a middle school without a pandemic – not to mention an epidemic of cellphone use. (Talent also endured a massive fire in 2020 that left many families homeless.) For this school year, Holden is using a new and clearly articulated policy: “Devices are put away from the first bell to the last bell,” she says. “We want them to have a focus on other things. We want them to be socializing, interacting with their peers face-to-face, thinking about getting to class. We want them making eye contact, asking questions. Learning how to make a friend face-to-face. Those are important developmental social skills they should be practicing.” Instead of scrolling through photos on Instagram, watching trending videos on TikTok, or texting their friends. Like Slusher, she announced the new cellphone policy last summer, in a letter sent home to parents along with the list of school supplies their children would need. “Students are welcome to use their cell phones and personal devices before entering the building prior to 8:30 a.m. and after exiting the school building at 3:10 p.m.,” she wrote. “However, during the school day students'cell phones and personal devices need to be off and out of sight."" “I think parents generally understand the need for this,” Holden says. “They’ve watched their children getting distracted at home by these devices, so they have a sense of how a cellphone adds a layer of challenge to learning. And parents are aware of the unkind behavior that often happens online.” As for the kids themselves? Safe to say the excitement that Slusher’s email got from Pennsville faculty, staff, and parents didn’t extend to students. “They don’t like it all, to be honest,” he says. “But they understand it’s for their benefit. When we sold it to them at our beginning-of-the-year meeting, we presented our rationale. From the kids I speak to, I think the majority understand why we’re doing it.”",0

278,"Can a very common allergy medicine improve survival among patients suffering from the serious skin cancer, malignant melanoma? A new study from Lund University in Sweden indicates that this may be the case.

""Previous studies have shown that the same antihistamines have survival benefits in breast cancer. Now we see the same thing concerning malignant melanoma. However, more research is required to confirm the results,"" emphasises Professor Håkan Olsson. He is one of the researchers behind the study, which was recently published in the research journal, Allergy.

In the study, the researchers examined the use of six antihistamines in patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma; desloratadine, cetirizine, loratadine, clemastine, ebastine and fexofenadine.

They have matched information from three large registers (the prescribed drug register, cancer register and cause of death register) for everyone in Sweden between 2006 and 2014 who received their first diagnosis of skin cancer, a total of 24 562 individuals. Of these individuals, 1 253 were antihistamine users. Most used desloratadine (395) cetirizine (324), loratadine (251) or clemastine (192). The other antihistamines were used by considerably fewer individuals. The follow-up of individuals was carried out on 31 December 2018.

""We observed improved survival among those who used desloratadine and to a certain extent also loratadine, particularly in the age group 65 and older, when we compared with those who had not used antihistamines. The use of the other antihistamines showed no significant survival effect. The use of desloratadine and loratadine also seemed to reduce the risk of getting a new malignant melanoma,"" says Håkan Olsson.

""The finding is interesting for a future drug against melanoma and may also help in advanced stages of the disease. In addition, the medicines have virtually no side effects.""

The research team is now planning animal experiments and randomised studies in order to understand the mechanisms behind the effect, the appropriate dose and optimum treatment period.

""We are collaborating with researchers in Barcelona and Stockholm. In Lund, we are underway with studies in both animal and human subjects, in which doses of antihistamines will be compared with the patients who do not take antihistamines, in order to measure the treatment effect,"" concludes Håkan Olsson.",0
279,"People with hypertriglyceridemia often are told to change their diet and lose weight. But a high-fat diet isn't necessarily the cause for everyone with the condition.

UCLA researchers have discovered a subset of people with hypertriglyceridemia whose bodies produce autoantibodies -- immune-response molecules that attack their own proteins -- causing high levels of triglycerides in the blood.

Hypertriglyceridemia, which can increase risk of both cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis, is often caused by or exacerbated by uncontrolled diabetes or obesity. High plasma triglyceride levels can also be caused by mutations in a variety of genes that regulate triglyceride metabolism. However, despite decades of research and a growing understanding of triglyceride metabolism, most cases of hypertriglyceridemia are poorly understood.

This newly discovered syndrome, dubbed the ""GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome,"" represents an important advance in understanding hypertriglyceridemia, said Dr. Stephen Young, UCLA cardiologist and molecular biologist, who led the study along with his colleagues Anne Beigneux and Loren Fong. All three are professors of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

""It's important to recognize this new syndrome because it is life threatening and potentially treatable,"" Young said. The study is published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Triglycerides in the bloodstream are broken down by an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, known as LPL, inside capillaries -- the body's smallest blood vessels. In 2010, Young, Beigneux and Fong discovered that another protein, GPIHBP1, binds to LPL and moves it into capillaries. Without GPIHBP1, LPL is stranded in the spaces between tissues, where it is useless for digesting the triglycerides in the bloodstream. The UCLA team went on to show that some people with hypertriglyceridemia have mutations in GPIHBP1 that keep it from binding to LPL, while others have mutations in LPL that keep it from binding to GPIHBP1. Both types of mutations prevent LPL from reaching the capillaries.

In their new research, Young, Beigneux, Fong and Katsuyuki Nakajima, a professor at Gunma University in Japan, found a group of people with hypertriglyceridemia whose GPIHBP1 can't transport lipoprotein lipase into capillaries. But in these cases, they didn't have genetic mutations; instead, they have autoantibodies against GPIHBP1 that prevent GPIHBP1 from binding LPL.

The scientists identified six people with autoantibodies against GPIHBP1. Four of those six had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder known to cause the body to develop autoantibodies against a variety of proteins. One of the six people with GPIHBP1 autoantibodies became pregnant. The autoantibodies against GPIHBP1 crossed the placenta and entered the baby's circulation; consequently, the newborn infant had severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fortunately, the infant's triglyceride levels gradually returned to normal with the disappearance of the mother's autoantibodies.

More research will be needed to define the frequency of the GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome and how to treat it, but it seems likely that immunosuppressive drugs could help reduce autoantibodies and lowering plasma triglyceride levels, Young said.

""The researchers have not only discovered a new disease, but their findings have suggested that the disease is treatable,"" said Dr. Michelle Olive, deputy chief, atherothrombosis and coronary artery disease branch of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, funder of the study. ""These findings are the result of years of NHLBI-funded studies of the molecular mechanisms of action of GPIHBP1 and are an excellent example of how basic science can lead to scientific advances with direct clinical implications.""

Added Young: ""GPIHBP1 autoantibodies need to be considered in any new case of severe hypertriglyceridemia.""",0

286,"Biomedical experts believe that half of heart failure patients likely have low levels of the thyroid hormone T3 in their cardiac tissue. While heart failure symptoms are commonly attributed to cardiovascular conditions like coronary artery disease and high blood pressure, a growing number of studies suggest that low cardiac T3 may significantly contribute to a patient's symptoms and underlying heart dysfunction. Now, researchers at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM) and FuWai Heart Hospital (Beijing, China) have developed a new use for a common blood test, which could provide a potentially life-saving treatment for heart failure.

Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot keep up with its workload, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen legs, and rapid heartbeat. In recent years, scientists have actively researched the connection between thyroid hormones and cardiac function, with clinical studies suggesting that borderline-low thyroid hormone levels may increase risk of death in heart failure patients, and animal studies indicating that restored cardiac thyroid levels can dramatically improve heart function.

The symptoms of low cardiac T3 are also virtually indistinguishable from other conditions that lead to heart failure, suggesting that a significant number of underlying heart dysfunction and heart failure symptoms may actually be caused by a treatable T3 hormone imbalance. Despite this treatability, clinicians are hesitant to prescribe T3 to heart patients, as too much of the hormone could accidentally trigger irregular heartbeat. In addition, no method has yet been identified to titrate, or continually measure and adjust, for the dosage of T3 needed to safely restore the heart's thyroid hormone function.

Now, as seen in Frontiers, an existing biomarker called brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may provide the much-needed solution. In medicine, biomarkers are biological molecules found in patient's blood, fluid, or tissue sample that can indicate whether a disease or condition is present. They can also be used to see how well the body responds to treatments. During heart failure, the heart will secrete higher levels of the biomarker BNP into blood, a key indication that the heart disease is worsening.

""I have been rather obsessed with the need for a serum biomarker for cardiac tissue T3 levels for many years,"" says Martin Gerdes, Ph.D., chair and professor of biomedical sciences at NYITCOM, who was one of the study's researchers. ""It dawned on me that the clinical literature showed a very consistent inverse relationship between serum T3 and BNP levels.""

The researchers hypothesized that by analyzing a patient's BNP levels in response to added T3, clinicians could titrate for just the right dosage required. Using rat models of heart failure caused by low T3 and heart attack, the researchers tested their theory, examining changes in BNP, cardiac function, and heart failure genes after T3 treatment. For the first time, they discovered through a simple blood test, not an extensive, invasive procedure, that T3 could be adjusted to safely restore cardiac hormone balance. In addition, because heart patients routinely undergo BNP and thyroid hormone testing, these widely used biomarkers could be easily monitored from blood tests.

""The results were remarkable, suggesting that serum BNP levels can be used to titrate the volume of T3 required,"" says Gerdes. ""When T3 treatment led to a reduction in serum BNP levels, this was associated with improved cardiac function and reversal of these heart failure genes.""

Gerdes and the team are hopeful that future investigations will confirm BNP's powerful new purpose in the very near future. ""The beauty of this biomarker is that it is already in widespread use, so efficacy could be shown quickly,"" he notes.",0

288,"Why do human mothers have a much harder time giving birth compared to our evolutionary cousins, the chimpanzees and macaques?

The differences are a big head and wide shoulders. But it has made all the difference for safer births.

""The question is actually two-fold, "" says study author Naoki Morimoto of Kyoto University. ""What also makes childbirth difficult for women is the relatively narrow pelvis.""

Morimoto's team discovered two central aspects of the female human skeletal anatomy that deserve attention when discussing the evolution of childbirth.

The first comes with its own set of points: initially, the growth of human shoulders slows down just before birth and speeds up thereafter; next, this phenomenon alleviates the problem of shoulder dystocia, where the shoulders interfere with safe passage of the fetus through the birth canal.

""It is important to note that the second point reconciles the incompatibility of wide shoulders with the narrow birth canal. The shoulders show an 'intelligent' modification in fetal development,"" notes lead author PhD candidate Mikaze Kawada.

What makes a human skeletal makeup 'human' in terms of the head and shoulders is size proportionality to the pelvis. Our largely developed brains have resulted in large heads, and our wide shoulders explain bipedal stability and an ability to throw objects far.

On the other hand, the need to make walking more efficient reduced the size of the pelvis as our ancestors treaded farther and more frequently.

Morimoto and his team used computed tomography to obtain cross-sectional representations of the clavicle in humans, chimpanzees, and Japanese macaques from fetal to adult samples.

The team then looked at different shoulder-width to birth-risk correlations between humans and the two other primates. Chimpanzees have proportionally large shoulders and yet, like macaques, fewer shoulder-related birth complications. Since chimpanzees move about less frequently on two feet, their pelvis -- and therefore their birth canal -- is larger than that of their human counterparts.

""We surmise that the wide shoulders, relative to the pelvis of our ancestors, emerged simultaneously with the narrower pelvis as we became fully bipedal,"" says Morimoto, ""but before the brain evolved to today's size.""

Morimoto concludes, ""This study motivates us to further examine the extent to which obstetric and metabolic constraints in our ancestors have influenced human ontogeny in relation to evolutionary adaptations.""",0

294,"A new study has revealed that the human brain's tiniest blood vessels can activate genes known to trigger spinal motor neurons, prompting the neurons to grow during early development. The findings could provide insights into how amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders may develop.

To make the discovery, investigators successfully re-created living tissues of the blood vessels and the spinal motor neurons -- which control muscles -- outside the body to show how they interact.

""Until now, people thought these blood vessels just delivered nutrients and oxygen, removed waste and adjusted blood flow. We showed that beyond plumbing, they are genetically communicating with the neurons,"" said Samuel Sances, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute. He is the first author of the study, published in the journal Stem Cell Reports.

When a human embryo is about four weeks old, Sances explained, new blood vessels begin to surround a primitive column of cells that eventually will become the spinal cord. Driven by developmental genes, some of these cells turn into spinal motor neurons. The study showed the cells of the brain's smallest blood vessels, known as capillaries, are capable of activating these genes, which can spur spinal motor neurons to grow and mature.

Besides providing insights into human biology, the study opened a new pathway to unraveling the mysteries of disorders such as ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, Sances said. ALS is a progressive, fatal disorder that kills motor neurons. There is no known cure. More than 6,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disorder each year, according to the ALS Association.

""What may go wrong in the spinal neurons that causes the motor neurons to die?"" Sances asked. ""If we can model an individual ALS patient's tissues, we may be able to answer that question and one day rescue ALS patients' neurons through new therapies.""

The study's findings were made possible by a unique pairing of stem cell science with Organs-on-Chips technology, which re-creates human biology in micro-engineered environments.

Cedars-Sinai investigators first took samples of skin cells from adults and genetically reprogramed them into induced pluripotent stem cells, which can create any type of cell -- in this case, spinal motor neurons and the lining of the brain's capillaries. The team placed these cells in the tiny channels of Organ-Chips, which are made of flexible polymer and are about the size of AA batteries. In the chips, nurtured by special fluids, the cells of the two different tissues thrived and interacted with each other.

""This study told us something important about how our neurons develop,"" said Clive Svendsen, PhD, professor of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, director of the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and senior author of the study. As a next step, he added, investigators are developing plans to use chip technology to compare the vessel-neuron interactions in ALS patients against those of individuals without ALS.

The research is part of the new Patient-on-a-Chip program, a collaboration between Cedars-Sinai and Emulate Inc. in Boston to help predict which disease treatments would be most effective based on a patient's genetic makeup and disease variant. Emulate produces the Organ-Chips used in the program. Geraldine A. Hamilton, PhD, Emulate's president and chief scientific officer, is a co-author of the spinal motor neuron study.

In February, investigators from the two organizations announced they had used an Intestine-Chip to model a human intestinal lining.

297,"Treating cancer with combinations of drugs can be more effective than using a single drug. However, figuring out the optimal combination of drugs, and making sure that all of the drugs reach the right place, can be challenging.

To help address those challenges, MIT chemists have designed a bottlebrush-shaped nanoparticle that can be loaded with multiple drugs, in ratios that can be easily controlled. Using these particles, the researchers were able to calculate and then deliver the optimal ratio of three cancer drugs used to treat multiple myeloma.

""There's a lot of interest in finding synergistic combination therapies for cancer, meaning that they leverage some underlying mechanism of the cancer cell that allows them to kill more effectively, but oftentimes we don't know what that right ratio will be,"" says Jeremiah Johnson, an MIT professor of chemistry and one of the senior authors of the study.

In a study of mice, the researchers showed that nanoparticles carrying three drugs in the synergistic ratio they identified shrank tumors much more than when the three drugs were given at the same ratio but untethered to a particle. This nanoparticle platform could potentially be deployed to deliver drug combinations against a variety of cancers, the researchers say.

Irene Ghobrial, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and P. Peter Ghoroghchian, president of Ceptur Therapeutics and a former MIT Koch Institute Clinical Investigator, are also senior authors of the paper, which appears today in Nature Nanotechnology. Alexandre Detappe, an assistant professor at the Strasbourg Europe Cancer Institute, and Hung Nguyen PhD '19 are the paper's lead authors.

Using nanoparticles to deliver cancer drugs allows the drugs to accumulate at the tumor site and reduces toxic side effects because the particles protect the drugs from being released prematurely. However, only a handful of nanoparticle drug formulations have received FDA approval to treat cancer, and only one of these particles carries more than one drug.

For several years, Johnson's lab has been working on polymer nanoparticles designed to carry multiple drugs. In the new study, the research team focused on a bottlebrush-shaped particle. To make the particles, drug molecules are inactivated by binding to polymer building blocks and then mixed together in a specific ratio for polymerization. This forms chains that extend from a central backbone, giving the molecule a bottlebrush-like structure with inactivated drugs -- prodrugs -- along the bottlebrush backbone. Cleavage of the linker that holds the drug to the backbone release the active agent.

""If we want to make a bottlebrush that has two drugs or three drugs or any number of drugs in it, we simply need to synthesize those different drug conjugated monomers, mix them together, and polymerize them. The resulting bottlebrushes have exactly the same size and shape as the bottlebrush that only has one drug, but now they have a distribution of two, three, or however many drugs you want within them,"" Johnson says.

In this study, the researchers first tested particles carrying just one drug: bortezomib, which is used to treat multiple myeloma, a cancer that affects a type of B cells known as plasma cells. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, a type of drug that prevents cancer cells from breaking down the excess proteins they produce. Accumulation of these proteins eventually causes the tumor cells to die.

When bortezomib is given on its own, the drug tends accumulate in red blood cells, which have high proteasome concentrations. However, when the researchers gave their bottlebrush prodrug version of the drug to mice, they found that the particles accumulated primarily in plasma cells because the bottlebrush structure protects the drug from being released right away, allowing it to circulate long enough to reach its target.

Using the bottlebrush particles, the researchers were also able to analyze many different drug combinations to evaluate which were the most effective.

Currently, researchers test potential drug combinations by exposing cancer cells in a lab dish to different concentrations of multiple drugs, but those results often don't translate to patients because each drug is distributed and absorbed differently inside the human body.

""If you inject three drugs into the body, the likelihood that the correct ratio of those drugs will arrive at the cancer cell at the same time can be very low. The drugs have different properties that cause them to go to different places, and that hinders the translation of these identified synergistic drug ratios quite immensely,"" Johnson says.

However, delivering all three drugs together in one particle could potentially overcome that obstacle and make it easier to deliver synergistic ratios. Because of the ease of creating bottlebrush particles with varying concentrations of drugs, the researchers were able to compare particles carrying different ratios of bortezomib and two other drugs used to treat multiple myeloma: an immunostimulatory drug called pomalidomide, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug.

Exposing these particles to cancer cells in a lab dish revealed combinations that were synergistic, but these combinations were different from the synergistic ratios that had been identified using drugs not bound to the bottlebrush.

""What that tells us is that whenever you are trying to develop a synergistic drug combination that you ultimately plan to administer in a nanoparticle, you should measure synergy in the context of the nanoparticle,"" Johnson says. ""If you measure it for the drugs alone, and then try to make a nanoparticle with that ratio, you can't guarantee it will be as effective.""

In tests in two mouse models of multiple myeloma, the researchers found that three-drug bottlebrushes with a synergistic ratio significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the free drugs given at the same ratio and to mixtures of three different single-drug bottlebrushes. They also discovered that their bortezomib-only bottlebrushes were very effective at slowing tumor growth when given in higher doses. Although it is approved for blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, bortezomib has never been approved for solid tumors due to its limited therapeutic window and bioavailability.

""We were happy to see that the bortezomib bottlebrush prodrug on its own was an excellent drug, displaying improved efficacy and safety compared to bortezomib, and that has led us to pursue trying to bring this molecule to the clinic as a next-generation proteasome inhibitor,"" Johnson says. ""It has completely different properties than bortezomib and gives you the ability to have a wider therapeutic index to treat cancers that bortezomib has not been used in before.""

Johnson, Nguyen, and Yivan Jiang PhD '19 have founded a company called Window Therapeutics, which is working on further developing these particles for testing in clinical trials. The company also hopes to explore other drug combinations that could be used against other types of cancer.

Johnson's lab is also working on using these particles to deliver therapeutic antibodies along with drugs, as well as combining them with larger particles that could deliver messenger RNA along with drug molecules. ""The versatility of this platform gives us endless opportunities to create new combinations,"" he says.",0

302,"Every meal you sit-down-to makes an impression, with foods filed away as something delicious to be sought out again, or to be avoided in disgust if we associate the flavor with gut malaise.

How this decision is made turns out to be so fundamental to our wellbeing -- determining what foods to seek and avoid -- that the signals are coordinated within the most primitive parts of our brains, the brain stem or hindbrain. This brain region also helps us decide when we are ""full"" and should stop eating.

To date, scientists interested in how and why people gain weight and the diseases that can result from overeating and obesity have focused on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, following discoveries of two intertwined systems that play important roles in controlling energy balance, the leptin and melanocortin systems.

A paper in the journal Nature Metabolism looks outside this brain region and reviews the various brain pathways that meet in the brain stem to control feeding behavior, using a technique that offers an unbiased look at the neurons involved.

""Everything the hypothalamus does ends up converging in the brainstem. The brain stem is super important in the control of feeding because it takes all sorts of information from your gut, including whether the stomach is distended and whether nutrients have been ingested, and integrates this with information from the hypothalamus about nutritional needs before passing it all on to the rhythmic pattern generators that control food intake,"" said Martin Myers, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., professor of internal medicine and Molecular & Integrative Physiology and director of the Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute.

The recent review builds on recent findings in mice from the Myers lab that revealed the existence of two different food intake-suppressing brain stem circuits- one that causes nausea and disgust, and one that does not, as well as from collaborations with colleague Tune Pers, Ph.D., of the University of Copenhagen. Pers and his group used single cell mapping of brain cells within the dorsal vagal complex, a region in the brain stem that mediates a host of unconscious processes, including feelings of satiety (or sickness) after eating.

The new review paper, from first author Wenwen Cheng, Ph.D., Myers, Pers, and their colleagues, integrates these findings with other recent discoveries to build a new model of brainstem neuronal circuits and how they control food intake and nausea.

""Taking all of this information together allows us to predict which set of neurons control this or that function,"" said Myers.

He notes that many of these cell populations are targets for new and effective anti-obesity drugs -- for example, a class of drugs for diabetes called GLP1 receptor agonists that can lower blood sugar and help you eat less.

""There is a population of GLP1 neurons in the brain stem which, if you turn them on, will stop food intake but cause violent illness, but there may be another population of neurons that stops eating without making you feel badly.""

Having a detailed map of these neurons and understanding the effects of modifying these cell targets, Myers explains, can assist in making drugs with fewer negative side effects.",0
303,"An investigational HIV vaccine regimen tested among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people was safe but did not provide protection against HIV acquisition, an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has determined. The HPX3002/HVTN 706, or ""Mosaico,"" Phase 3 clinical trial began in 2019 and involved 3,900 volunteers ages 18 to 60 years in Europe, North America and South America. Based on the DSMB's recommendation, the study will be discontinued. Participants are being notified of the findings, and further analyses of the study data are planned.

Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, sponsored the Mosaico study with funding support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The trial was conducted by the NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Network, based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command provided additional study support.

The experimental vaccine regimen was developed by Janssen. It was based on ""mosaic"" immunogens -- vaccine components featuring elements of multiple HIV subtypes -- with the goal of inducing immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains. The investigational vaccine regimen consisted of four injections over a year of Ad26.Mos4.HIV. This vaccine candidate uses a common-cold virus (adenovirus serotype 26, or Ad26) to deliver the mosaic immunogens. The final two vaccinations were accompanied by a bivalent (two-component) HIV envelope protein formulation, combining clade C gp140 and mosaic gp140 envelope proteins, adjuvanted by aluminum phosphate to boost immune responses. All study vaccinations were completed in October 2022.

In its scheduled data review, the DSMB determined there were no safety issues with the experimental vaccine regimen. However, the number of HIV infections were equivalent between the vaccine and placebo arms of the study. During the clinical trial, all participants were offered comprehensive HIV prevention tools, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Study staff ensured that participants who acquired HIV during the trial were promptly referred for medical care and treatment.

The Mosaico findings track with developments in the Phase 2b ""Imbokodo"" (HPX2008/HVTN 705) clinical trial, which was testing a similar HIV vaccine regimen in young women in sub-Saharan Africa.

308,"Multi-step screening process leads to molecule that may protect brain cells.

In the fight against brain damage caused by stroke, researchers have turned to an unlikely source of inspiration: hibernating ground squirrels.

While the animals’ brains experience dramatically reduced blood flow during hibernation, just like human patients after a certain type of stroke, the squirrels emerge from their extended naps suffering no ill effects. Now, a team of NIH-funded scientists has identified a potential drug that could grant the same resilience to the brains of ischemic stroke patients by mimicking the cellular changes that protect the brains of those animals. The study was published in The FASEB Journal, the official journal of the Foundation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

“For decades scientists have been searching for an effective brain-protecting stroke therapy to no avail. If the compound identified in this study successfully reduces tissue death and improves recovery in further experiments, it could lead to new approaches for preserving brain cells after an ischemic stroke,” said Francesca Bosetti, Ph.D., Pharm.D., program director at the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

An ischemic stroke occurs when a clot cuts off blood flow to part of the brain, depriving those cells of oxygen and nutrients like the blood sugar glucose that they need to survive. Nearly 800,000 Americans experience a stroke every year and 87 percent of those are ischemic strokes.

Currently, the only way to minimize stroke-induced cell death is to remove the clot as soon as possible. A treatment to help brain cells survive a stroke-induced lack of oxygen and glucose could dramatically improve patient outcomes, but no such neuroprotective agents for stroke patients exist.

Recently, researchers led by John Hallenbeck, M.D., an NINDS senior investigator and co-senior author of the study, found that a cellular process called SUMOylation goes into overdrive in a certain species of ground squirrel during hibernation. Dr. Hallenbeck suspected this was how the animals’ brains survived the reduced blood flow caused by hibernation, and subsequent experiments in cells and mice confirmed his suspicions.

“If we could only turn on the process hibernators appear to use to protect their brains, we could help protect the brain during a stroke and ultimately help people recover,” said Joshua Bernstock, a graduate student in Dr. Hallenbeck’s lab and the study’s first author.

SUMOylation occurs when an enzyme attaches a molecular tag called a Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) to a protein, altering its activity and location in the cell. Other enzymes called SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) can then detach those tags, thereby decreasing SUMOylation. In the current study, Bernstock and his colleagues teamed up with researchers from the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to examine whether any of over 4,000 molecules from the NCATS small molecule collections could boost SUMOylation by blocking a SENP called SENP2, which would theoretically protect cells from a shortage of life-sustaining substances.

The researchers first used an automated process to examine whether the compounds prevented SENP2 from severing the connection between a tiny metal bead and an artificial SUMO protein created in the lab of Wei Yang, Ph.D., the study’s other senior author and an associate professor at Duke University in Durham, NC. This system, along with computer modeling and further tests performed both in and outside of cells, whittled the thousands of candidate molecules down to eight that could bind to SENP2 in cells and were non-toxic. Two of those – ebselen and 6-thioguanine – were then found to both boost SUMOylation in rat cells and keep them alive in the absence of oxygen and glucose.

A final experiment showed that ebselen boosted SUMOylation in the brains of healthy mice more than a control injection. 6-thioguanine was not tested because it is a chemotherapy drug with side effects that make it unsuitable as a potential stroke treatment. The researchers now plan to test whether ebselen can protect the brains of animal models of stroke.

Because SUMOylation affects a variety of molecules, Bernstock believes his group’s approach could inspire similar attempts to treat neurological conditions by targeting pathways with wide-ranging effects. He also hopes it will prompt others to look to natural models, as he and Dr. Hallenbeck did with the ground squirrel.

“As a physician-scientist, I really like to work on projects that have clear relevance for patients,” Bernstock said. “I always want outcomes that can lend themselves to new therapeutics for people who are in need.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Programs of the NINDS and NCATS, NINDS grant NS099590, the NIH-OxCam Fellowship, and the American Heart Association.

314,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the personal and social importance as well as the challenges of estimating risks. New research from the University of California San Diego sheds light on how people perceive risks, finding that detailed knowledge of probabilities can make risks seem less risky.

For example, if people are informed that 27% of the population carries at least one copy of a gene that can cause Alzheimer's Disease, they may worry they have that gene. However, if you specify that this occurs because 25% have one copy of the gene and 2% have two copies of the gene, the subjective perception of risk becomes less urgent. Yet, it is still true that 27% of people carry a gene that could lead to Alzheimer.

""There's something about learning those individual probabilities that shifts the way you think about the risk and causes you to actually reduce your estimate it will occur,"" said Uma R. Karmarkar, study co-author and assistant professor of marketing and innovation at UC San Diego's Rady School of Management and School of Global Policy and Strategy.

The robust results, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, are based on findings that were replicated in more than a dozen different experiments with more than 1,500 participants living across the U.S.

In one experiment, 390 subjects who participated in the study via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform were assigned into three groups. All groups were provided with the information that ""every single person has a 58% chance of getting a flea bite that causes a newly discovered bacterial infection."" Then, two groups were given more specific information. One group saw that the bites could come from various types of fleas and this caused them to think a flea bite was more likely. A different group saw the various types of fleas, and the probability of a bite from each type-receiving the explicit probability information led them to perceive the initial warning as less likely to happen.

""Giving all those independent reasons with their probabilities may seem like it would enhance a recognition of how important an event is, but can actually diminish the overall risk,"" Karmarkar said. ""When this happens, the 'unlikelihood effect' comes into play. One thing that this means is that providing specific information on probabilities can help alleviate fear of negative outcomes.""

While the study focused on health risks, the authors also tested the theory using potential positive outcomes, such as winning a lottery. Alongside the overall probability of hitting the jackpot, some subjects received supplementary information, such as ""if I pull a colored ball from this urn, you'll win 50 dollars."" This additional information made subjects perceive themselves as less likely to win. In positive scenarios, the ""unlikelihood effect"" still holds.

Karmakar notes that how institutions and policymakers provide information about health risks has become increasingly crucial.

""When communicating about risks, it's important to be mindful of the goals of providing such information and what behaviors it is intended to drive,"" she said. ""This research can help policymakers refine their messaging to make sure their communications are impactful.""

322,"First lady Jill Biden is among the White House officials involved in the expanded Cancer Moonshot program. Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty Images
• The coordinator of the White House’s new Cancer Moonshot initiative tells Healthline the program has bold new goals and strategies.
• Its chief targets are to accelerate cancer research and improve earlier cancer detection.
• The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense are among the many agencies participating. Six years ago, then-Vice President Joe Biden launched the initiative with the mission of improving the rate of progress against cancer in the United States. During the program’s launch, Biden announced several goals, including accelerating scientific discovery, improving the sharing of data, and working on earlier cancer detection. Six years later, on February 2, 2022, President Joe Biden announced plans for an even bigger, broader Cancer Moonshot program that promises to “end cancer as we know it.” “We will re-establish White House leadership with a White House Cancer Moonshot coordinator in the Executive Office of the President, to demonstrate the President and First Lady’s personal commitment to making progress and to leverage the whole-of-government approach and national response that the challenge of cancer demands,” Biden said. That new White House Moonshot Coordinator, Danielle Carnival, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and former chief executive officer of the I AM ALS non-profit organization, spoke with Healthline this week to help explain where the new Cancer Moonshot is headed and what it means for everyone. “The reignited Cancer Moonshot is focused on forging new partnerships, interagency programs, and collaborations, both public and private,” said Carnival, who’s been with the program since its inception. “The president has set bold new goals and, to achieve them, we need to come at this disease in every way we can. We need all hands on deck,” she said.

The most ambitious new goal is to decrease the cancer death rate by 50 percent in the next 25 years, said Carnival. A new Cancer Cabinet will be convened by the White House, she noted, that brings together departments and agencies and non-profits and more to address cancer on multiple fronts. These include the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also include the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Domestic Policy Council, Gender Policy Council, Office of the First Lady, Office of the Vice President, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Public Engagement. “The formation of the Cancer Cabinet was key,” Carnival said. “This time around, the Cancer Moonshot is an even bigger umbrella. This time it is all about innovation and reaching more people.” And that, Carnival noted, includes many under-served populations, from people of color to native Americans and others.

The big-picture goals of the Cancer Moonshot haven’t really changed, but they have expanded and progressed. For example, when Biden introduced the Cancer Moonshot in 2016, one of his personal priorities was something called liquid biopsies, which at the time was a technology few people outside the lab knew about. Biden believed in the technology because it was a noninvasive blood test that even in early trials was detecting cancer in its early stages. “In the 2016 speech, then-Vice President Biden painted the picture of where we are headed,” Carnival said. “He was focused on early detection of cancer from liquid biopsies. And now, six years later, the President remains just as excited about the potential of that technology, which has already begun to make a difference.” Most everyone agrees that this technology, which in some cases is already being used in the clinic, has enormous potential. “The president is hopeful about the promise of early detection using these tests. The National Cancer Institute has announced that they are providing a platform for clinical trials,” Carnival said. “There will be rigorous research on this. And we need to make sure that the healthcare system, including primary care physicians, are involved,” she added.

Another vital contributor to the reignited Moonshot is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “We agree that VA drives research, we know that it is the largest health system in the country, and we are using that resource,” Carnival said. The agency, which has 171 medical centers and 1,112 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity, represents an opportunity to help move cancer science forward and help veterans heal, Carnival said. Denis McDonough, Secretary of the VA, said in a conversation during a Cancer Moonshot: Goals Forum last week that the VA has embraced precision medicine and is all in with the reignited Cancer Moonshot. He said he strongly supports further partnerships and getting the VA even more involved in clinical trials. The VA, McDonough said, is pursuing a multi-center approach as they build more trials to test these cancer detection technologies. “We have amazing longitudinal data that allows us to play a critical role in these clinical trials,” he said.",0
323,"Adding immunotherapy to standard anti-rejection medication could change the lives of thousands of kidney transplant patients with incurable cancer, as new research shows it can reduce this risk of organ rejection and eliminate cancer in a quarter of patients.

Conducted by researchers at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and the University of South Australia, the world-first study showed that a dual combination of transplant anti-rejection drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors* not only reduced organ rejection rates to 12 per cent (from 40-50 per cent) but also eradicated cancer cells in 25 per cent of patients.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that block proteins called checkpoints. These checkpoints help keep immune responses from being too strong but can also keep T-cells from killing cancer cells. When these checkpoints are blocked, the T-cells can kill cancer cells more effectively.

UniSA researcher and renal specialist at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Associate Professor Rob Carroll, says these findings are a gamechanger for kidney transplant patients with incurable cancer.

""Cancer is a leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients with the rate of cancer being three-times higher in this group, than in the general population,"" Assoc Prof Carroll says.

""The terrible irony is that the immunosuppressants that patients must always take to stop their immune systems attacking their transplants, are also the medicines that stops the immune system getting rid of pre-cancer cells.

""To correct this imbalance, our study tested the efficacy of maintaining baseline anti-rejection drugs (to protect the transplant) and adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (to attack the cancer).

""The patients responded well with lower rates of organ rejection to 12 per cent, compared to previous reports and eliminating cancers cells in 25 per cent of patients.

332,"A newly published paper in The Lancet shows that an experimental vaccine against Marburg virus (MARV) was safe and induced an immune response in a small, first-in-human clinical trial. The vaccine, developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, could someday be an important tool to respond to Marburg virus outbreaks.

This first-in-human, Phase 1 study tested an experimental MARV vaccine candidate, known as cAd3-Marburg, which was developed at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC). This vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee adenovirus called cAd3, which can no longer replicate or infect cells, and displays a glycoprotein found on the surface of MARV to induce immune responses against the virus. The cAd3 vaccine platform demonstrated a good safety profile in prior clinical trials when used in investigational Ebola virus and Sudan virus vaccines developed by the VRC.

MARV, a filovirus in the same family as Ebola virus, causes a rapidly progressive febrile illness that leads to shock and death in a large proportion of infected individuals. Many scientists think that MARV disease outbreaks in humans begin by when the virus makes the jump from its primary animal host, which is likely to be certain chronically infected bats in sub-Saharan Africa. The symptoms of MARV disease are akin to those seen with Ebola virus disease and can include fever, headache, chills, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. As the disease progresses, patients may suffer from multiple organ dysfunction, delirium, and significant bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or other sites that may result in death. No approved vaccines or specific therapies are available for MARV disease, aside from supportive care. While some experimental vaccines have previously been tested, none have proven to be both highly effective and to provide durable protection. In areas of Africa where a vaccine for Marburg is most needed, a single-dose vaccine that could protect recipients over a long period of time would be a crucial part of quelling outbreaks.

In this study, 40 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Clinical Trials Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. They received a single dose of either a low dose of the vaccine (1x1010 particle units) or a higher dose (1x1011 particle units). For safety, the volunteers were enrolled in a dose-escalation plan. Three participants received the lower dose. Then, when they did not exhibit severe adverse reactions after the first seven days, the trial proceeded to enroll the remaining 17 volunteers. The same procedure was also used for the higher dose group. Volunteers were monitored for adverse reactions to the investigational vaccine and evaluated at regular intervals for 48 weeks to track their immune responses.

The trial's safety results were encouraging: There were no serious adverse events, and the experimental vaccine was well-tolerated. One participant in the higher dose group developed a fever following vaccination, but it resolved by the following day. In addition, the investigational vaccine appeared to induce strong, long-lasting immunity to the MARV glycoprotein: 95% of participants in the trial exhibited a robust antibody response after vaccination, and 70% maintained that response for more than 48 weeks.

Plans are in place to conduct further trials of the cAd3-Marburg vaccine in Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and the United States. If additional data supports the promising results seen in the Phase 1 trial, the cAd3-Marburg virus vaccine could someday be used in emergency responses to MARV outbreaks.",0

337,"Changes in DNA can lead to the development and progression of cancer. DNA serves as a template for an intermediary molecule called RNA that, in turn, codes for proteins that control all cellular processes. Most cancer research and available anticancer drugs focus on the impact of DNA and protein alterations that contribute to cancer; however, it is now understood that RNA molecules can also both positively and negatively impact the development of cancer. In a new article published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, Moffitt Cancer Center researchers describe how RNA molecules promote the development of melanoma metastasis by impacting anti-tumor microRNA.

MicroRNA (miRNA) molecules are small segments of nonprotein coding RNA that can silence other protein-coding RNA molecules and regulate the production of proteins. When the activity of miRNA molecules is perturbed, diseases such as cancer can develop. Recently, it has been shown that this regulation also works in the opposite direction, where protein coding RNAs act as ""sponges"" to bind to miRNA molecules and block their function. RNAs affecting the function of miRNAs are called competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and are thought to play an important role in cancer development independent of their protein-coding activity.

The existence of ceRNA has been known since approximately 2010, but its impact on cancer development is not well understood. Since DNA copy number alterations impact cancer, Moffitt researchers wanted to determine whether these DNA alterations can drive cancer development through ceRNAs.

The team analyzed chromosome alterations and discovered that gains in chromosome segment 1q were very common among a panel of metastatic melanoma cases. A more in-depth analysis revealed that three key genes called CEP170, NUCKS1andZC3H11A present on chromosome 1q are amplified in metastatic melanoma cases and associated with disease progression.

Given the potential clinical implications of these alterations, the researchers wanted to understand the molecular contributions of CEP170, NUCKS1andZC3H11Ato melanoma development. They performed a series of laboratory experiments and discovered that the RNA sequences of CEP170, NUCKS1andZC3H11A promote cell growth, migration and invasion in melanoma cell lines, and stimulated metastasis growth in mouse models of melanoma, independent of their protein-coding activity. Mechanistically, the researchers discovered that the RNA sequences of the three genes act as ceRNAs that sponge miRNA molecules that function to inhibit tumor growth and development. Therefore, by ""soaking up"" the miRNA molecules and their blocking antitumor activity, the ceRNA molecules drive tumor growth and metastasis. Importantly, the researchers discovered that copy number alterations of CEP170, NUCKS1andZC3H11A were present in other tumor types, including breast, colon, liver and lung cancer, suggesting that these alterations may be important for other cancer types as well.

These results will likely change the widely held view that the key to cancer primarily relies on the structure and function of proteins and opens avenues for new investigations into a biological area that is only beginning to be studied.

""Our study challenges the notion that somatic copy number alterations promote cancer predominantly through their encoded proteins and establishes ceRNAs as potent drivers underlying the oncogenicity of somatic copy number alterations,"" said Florian Karreth, Ph.D., study author and assistant member of the Molecular Oncology Department.

June 8, 2020 -- The World Health Organization has changed its stance on wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.People over 60 and people with underlying medical conditions should wear a medical-grade mask when they're in public and cannot socially distance, the WHO said. The general public should wear a three-layer fabric mask in those situations.
The WHO also updated their advice for medical workers, saying all of them should always wear a medical mask while in clinical areas, not just people working with COVID-19 patients.
The organization had previously said there wasn't enough medical evidence to support members of the public wearing a mask, unless they were sick or around people with the coronavirus. The widespread wearing of masks might lead to a mask shortage for medical workers and create a false sense of security in the public, WHO officials had said.""

339,"Everyone breathes in Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria from time to time, but most people don't get sick. These bacteria, cousins of the deadly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, tend to live out their harmless little lives in food, soil, water, or dust.

Then there's the rare person who gets very, very sick.

MAC is an ""opportunistic"" pathogen, explains Cecilia Lindestam Arlehamn, Ph.D., Research Assistant Professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI). Some people do have risk factors -- such as cystic fibrosis and structural lung diseases, for example -- that make them likely to develop symptoms after MAC exposure. The problem is that no one knows exactly why these factors make such a difference.

Now Lindestam Arlehamn's laboratory has uncovered an immune cell defect tied to the risk of developing MAC disease. As her team reports in Frontiers in Immunology, people who show MAC infection symptoms have fewer specialized Th1* (Th1 ""star"") cells, which robs them of the ability to mount an effective immune response to the bacteria.

""We think these people have this cellular defect going into MAC exposure,"" explains Lindestam Arlehamn, who worked closely on the study with collaborators at the University of Washington.

This research may be a step toward uncovering biomarkers to predict risk of progressive lung disease and responses to treatment in MAC disease patients.

In 2020, Lindestam Arlehamn received funding through a Tullie and Rickey Families SPARK Award to investigate how T cells fight the disease. The hope was that by analyzing T cells from people previously infected with MAC, she could identify key targets, or epitopes, where MAC-infected cells are vulnerable to immune system attacks.

T cells are normally critical for fighting infections, yet to everyone's surprise, Lindestam Arlehamn's work revealed that the human body has a very limited T cell response to MAC infection, and she wasn't able to uncover MAC-specific epitopes.

It's pretty unusual for a T cell response to a pathogen to be so limited. It was like the MAC-infected study volunteers had barely any ""immune memory"" of getting the disease. Instead, Lindestam Arlehamn's SPARK project highlighted an unexpected cellular defect that could explain why some people get sick while others don't. ""This was also very interesting,"" says Lindestam Arlehamn.

When Lindestam Arlehamn looked at global gene expression (which genes are ""switched on"") in response to MAC infection, she spotted a stark difference in blood samples from people previously infected with MAC and healthy controls.

People who had MAC appeared to have a immunologic defect that leads to low numbers of special ""helper"" immune cells called Th1* cells in the body. Th1* cells normally help alert the body's pathogen-fighting cells to danger.

Lindestam Arlehamn and her colleagues were among the first to show that Th1* cells are particularly critical for fighting a Mycobacterium attack, either from MAC or Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Their work is the first to suggest that this Th1* defect can lead to increased disease susceptibility. They think it's likely that without enough Th1* cells, some key immune cells never get the message that MAC is trying to invade. This means MAC-susceptible people may have both an over-performing innate immune response (with certain cells driving inflammation early in the disease process) and an under-performing adaptive immune response (a lack of activated T cells to actually stop the disease).

For some people, this lack of an immune defense is too much to bear. For people with cystic fibrosis, for example, thick mucus in the lungs may interfere with the ability of T cells to patrol the tissue and detect MAC. A lack of Th1* cells could then be a double-blow -- adding immune system dysfunction to an already weak defense in the lungs. ""That could partially explain it,"" says Lindestam Arlehamn.

Lindestam Arlehamn now wants to confirm whether the defect leading to fewer Th1* cells is present in people prior to MAC exposure. She plans to look at samples taken from people earlier in the disease progression to see if a lack of Th1* is a feature for them as well. She'd also like to study samples from people who were exposed to the same sources of MAC in the environment.

""If you live together with someone with MAC disease, it's likely that you are exposed too,"" she says. We want to see if we can define specific T cell responses in those individuals and look for the differences between those who get sick and those who don't.""

This work could help researchers get to the bottom of exactly how MAC goes from harmless to highly pathogenic.

346,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Researchers at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine have devised an immunotherapy technique that combines chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, or CAR-T cell therapy, with a cancer-killing virus to more effectively target and treat solid cancer tumors.

The combination approach, published in Science Translational Medicine, involves loading CAR-T cells, which are engineered to look for antigens on cancer cells, with an oncolytic virus. Oncolytic viruses are naturally occurring viruses that can infect and break down cancer cells. They either naturally replicate well in cancer cells or can be engineered to selectively target cancer cells.

The study suggests CAR-T cells can deliver the oncolytic virus to the tumor. Then the virus can infiltrate tumor cells, replicate to bust the cells open, and stimulate a potent immune response.

""This approach allows the tumor to be killed by the virus as well as by the CAR-T cells,"" explains Richard Vile, Ph.D., co-leader of the Gene and Virus Therapy Program within Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation Professor. ""In addition, when the virus is delivered, it turns the tumor into a very inflammatory environment, which the patient's own immune system then sees and starts to attack.""

The therapeutic strategy addresses two major challenges that make solid tumors difficult to treat with CAR-T cell therapy alone. First, the oncolytic virus can break down the molecular shield that some solid tumors use to avoid an immune system attack. Second, the virus can invade into the core of the cancer cells — a near-impossible feat for immune cells alone, which often lose their power in the attempt.

The researchers also found that the combination approach provided an immune memory phenotype against the tumor.

""By putting the virus onto the CAR-T, we activate them against both the virus and the tumor, and they acquire immunological memory,"" Dr. Vile says. ""This allows us to give a boost with the virus at a later time point, which in turn makes the CAR-T cells wake up again and undergo additional rounds of killing the tumor.""

Using mouse models, Dr. Vile and his team delivered the dual therapy intravenously to treat pediatric and adult high-grade glioma, as well as melanoma in the skin. They found that the combination therapy led to high cure rates in tumors in multiple sites without causing significant toxicity. They also found it resulted in apparent protection in the cured mice against tumor recurrence.

""Clinically, delivering the therapy systemically is a potential advantage because you could possibly treat patients with metastatic disease without having to inject each tumor,"" Dr. Vile explains.

Next, Dr. Vile emphasizes it will be important to be cautious about how well studies in animal models of cancer will translate into patient care.

""Nonetheless, we are hopeful that we will be able to take this strategy into clinical trials within a year or two,"" Dr. Vile says. ""By doing such trials at Mayo Clinic, it will be possible to see if we can add a further level of efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy to the treatment of solid tumors of different types.""

352,"Cancer that splits and develops in new organs around the body becomes significantly more difficult to fight. Now, researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have shown that these metastatic cancers, that spread from the original, adapt their metabolism to the tissue in which they grow. The discovery represents a breakthrough for the understanding of metastatic cancer and is an important piece of the puzzle in the search for more effective treatments.

Metabolism in the human body can be likened to its internal engine. It is a prerequisite for our cells to grow and receive energy. Therefore, it is also an important target for cancer treatments, where the focus is on stopping the progress of cancer cells.

In a new study, which was recently presented in the scientific journal PNAS, researchers in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Chalmers have examined how metabolism works in cancer cells that have spread via metastases -- also called secondary tumors -- to new organs. The study gave the researchers new insights into how the metastases adapt to their new environment.

""Obviously, the local environment affects the cancer cells more than previously known. The metastatic tumours should show the same metabolic properties no matter where in the body they are located, but we discovered that the cancer cells largely adapted their metabolism to the new tissue in order to continue to develop and grow. This is important knowledge, which shows that we cannot consider the metastases as their original tumors,"" says Fariba Roshanzamir, PhD in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Chalmers and the study's lead author.

Fariba Roshanzamir works in Professor Jens Nielsen's research group at Chalmers and has, together with Swedish and international colleagues, been able to establish the groundbreaking results. The study focused primarily on so-called triple-negative breast cancer -- a severe breast cancer that is difficult to treat with drugs -- but the conclusions can, according to the researchers, be applied to all types of metastatic cancer. This opens new doors to develop more effective treatments.

""If we manage to shut down the metabolism in a tumour, it will stop working and this study provides important keys to better understand what to target. Selecting metabolic inhibitors that specifically target the metastases in the organs to which the tumour has spread, rather than treating them as their original tumours, is of great importance to be able to find good strategies for treatments in the future,"" she says.

New view of the properties of metastases

Today, the spread of cancer to new organs is one of the leading causes of death in cancer patients. Jens Nielsen, Professor of Systems and Synthetic Biology at Chalmers University of Technology and one of the study's authors, hopes that it will lead to a new view of the properties and behavior of metastases.

""This is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of metastatic cancer and an important step on the way to more individualised drugs,"" he says.",0

357,"The number of cases of tick-borne illnesses (TBIs) reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than doubled over the past two decades in the United States. An expert panel has developed a set of clinical practice guidelines that recommends low-risk interventions, employable with minimal resources, to help reduce the number of TBIs. The guidelines, issued by the Wilderness Medical Society, appear in Wilderness & Environmental Medicine, published by Elsevier.

Although Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States, the incidence of other TBIs, including anaplasmosis, spotted fever rickettsiosis, babesiosis, tularemia, alpha-gal syndrome, and Powassan virus, continues to rise as well. Lyme disease accounted for nearly 70% of cases of TBI reported in 2019, anaplasmosis 16%, and spotted fever rickettsiosis 10%. Experts believe that formal reporting probably underestimates the disease burden.

""TBI is influenced by the environment, geography, climate, ecology, and animal and human behavior,"" explained lead author Benjamin M. Ho, MD, Southern Wisconsin Emergency Associates, Janesville, WI, USA. ""It cannot be completely avoided given the interactions between humans and the environment. However, the overall burden of disease related to TBIs can be reduced with certain behavioral and medical adaptations.""

The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of TBI. The guidelines include a brief review of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, prevention, and management of TBIs in the United States, with a primary focus on interventions that are appropriate for resource-limited settings. Their recommendations are largely consistent with those presented by the CDC and other practice guidelines, but they specifically highlight concepts most relevant to providers who encounter ticks in backcountry, austere, and limited-resource settings.
• Light-colored clothing may not reduce the risk of tick bites but makes it easier to identify ticks on clothes during tick checks.
• N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is an effective tick repellent. It can be used in children over the age of two months.
• The efficacy of picaridin compares favorably to DEET. It may have a superior safety profile when compared to DEET.
• Permethrin-treated clothing may further reduce the risk of TBI when used in combination with a skin-based tick repellent such as DEET or picaridin.
• Avoid essential oils, citriodiol, nootkatone, and IR3535 as a first line repellent as they have either a lower repellent efficacy or significantly shorter duration of action.
• Evidence supporting tick checks is contradictory but may help prevent TBI when combined with showering or bathing within two hours of returning from tick habitat.
• Washing clothes at temperatures over 54°C/130°F and drying clothing in high heat for ten minutes kills ticks and may reduce the risk of TBIs.
• When feasible, avoid areas with high grass or leaf litter. When in tick habitat, walk in the middle of trails to reduce the chance of contact with ticks.
• Mechanical removal by pulling upward, or perpendicular to skin with forceps, directly on an embedded tick, is the best currently available method. Commercial devices may also work, but there is no evidence suggesting they are superior. Pulling embedded ticks with straight, steady pressure is preferred over a twisting movement.
• Chemical strategies that involve exposing attached ticks to petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, isopropyl alcohol, gasoline, or methylated spirits are ineffective and not recommended.
• There is no evidence that using local or systemic medications such as locally infiltrated anesthetics or systemic ivermectin is effective in removing or exterminating attached ticks.
• Remove ticks as soon as possible. To meaningfully reduce the risk of Lyme disease, ticks should be removed within 36 hours.
• A single dose of 200 mg doxycycline orally is recommended after a high-risk tick bite to reduce the risk of Lyme disease if given within 72 hours.
• Outside of high-risk Lyme disease exposures, prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated.
• Individuals who develop systemic or high-risk symptoms (fever, generalized rash, arthralgias, cranial nerve palsy, dyspnea, or syncope) related to a suspected TBI should be evacuated to a higher level of medical care.
• Individuals who develop symptoms suggestive of Lyme carditis such as dyspnea, dizziness, or syncope should receive a screening ECG as soon as possible and would benefit from a thorough cardiovascular evaluation in an appropriate clinical setting.
• Although no vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis is currently available in the United States, vaccines such as Encepur appear to be efficacious for inducing seroconversion against tick-borne encephalitis.
• Educational programs should be encouraged as these can change behavior and lower rates of TBI.

""With a changing climate that continues to influence the epidemiology of TBI, promotion and strict adherence to simple prevention measures is important,"" commented Dr. Ho. ""Despite the limitations of the existing literature, these guidelines provide a starting point for front-line providers to mitigate the transmission and reduce the disease burden of TBIs through education and low-risk interventions.""",0
358,"In a recent article, Kessler Foundation scientists advocated for the incorporation of virtual reality (VR) technology in cognitive rehabilitation research in multiple sclerosis (MS). They presented a conceptual framework supporting VR as an adjuvant to traditional cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training for MS, theorizing that VR could strengthen the effects of traditional rehabilitative therapies by increasing sensory input and promoting multisensory integration and processing.

MS and exercise researchers Carly L.A. Wender, PhD, John DeLuca, PhD, and Brian M. Sandroff, PhD, authored the review, ""Developing the rationale for including virtual reality in cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training approaches for managing cognitive dysfunction in MS,"" which was published open access on April 3, 2022 by NeuroSci as part of the Special Issue Cognitive Impairment and Neuropsychiatric Dysfunctions in Multiple Sclerosis.

Current pharmacological therapies for MS are not effective for cognitive dysfunction, a common consequence of MS that affects the daily lives of many individuals. This lack of efficacy underscores the need to consider other approaches to managing these disabling cognitive deficits.

The inclusion of VR technology in rehabilitation research and care for MS has the potential not only to improve cognition but to facilitate the transfer of those cognitive gains to improvements in everyday function, according to Brian Sandroff, PhD, senior research scientist in the Center for Neuropsychology and Neuroscience Research at Kessler Foundation. ""With VR, we can substantially increase engagement and the volume of sensory input,"" he foresees. ""And by promoting multisensory integration and processing, VR can augment the effects of the two most promising nonpharmacological treatments -- cognitive rehabilitation and exercise.""

Virtual environments are flexible and varied, enabling investigators to control the range and progression of cognitive challenges, with the potential for greater adaptations and stronger intervention effects. VR also allows for the incorporation of cognitive rehabilitation strategies into exercise training sessions, which may support a more direct approach to improving specific cognitive domains through exercise prescriptions. The application of VR to stroke research has shown more improvement in motor outcomes compared with traditional therapy, as well as greater neural activation in the affected area of the brain, suggesting that greater gains may persist over time.

Dr. Sandroff emphasized the largely conceptual advantages for the use of VR to treat cognitive dysfunction in individuals with MS. ""More clinical research is needed to explore the efficacy of combining VR with cognitive rehabilitation and/or exercise training, and the impact on everyday functioning on individual with MS,"" Dr. Sandroff concluded. ""The conceptual framework we outline includes examples of ways immersive and interactive VR can be incorporated into MS clinical trials that will form the basis for larger randomized clinical trials.""",0

362,"We know that children with pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) also suffer from seasonal allergies. A new study being presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting in Houston shows that allergy shots (subcutaneous immunotherapy) can be effective in reducing PFAS symptoms for pediatric patients.

Pollen food allergy syndrome (also known as oral allergy syndrome) is caused by cross-reacting allergens found in both pollen and raw fruits, vegetables or some tree nuts. Symptoms usually include itchy mouth, scratchy throat or swelling of the lips, mouth, tongue and throat.

""We surveyed 20 pediatric patients between the ages of 9 and 18 receiving allergy shots as treatment for mugwort, timothy and orchard grass allergies,"" says allergist Alana Jones, DO, ACAAI member and co-author of the study. ""All 20 patients reported PFAS symptoms. Of the 20 surveyed, 11 (55 percent) described improvement or resolution of their symptoms. Four (20 percent) reported unchanged symptoms and five (25 percent) reported they hadn't tried to reintroduce foods they'd previously reacted to.""

PFAS typically does not appear in young children. It is more common in older children, teens and young adults who have been eating the fruits or vegetables in question for years without any problems. In addition, young children under the age of 3 do not usually develop hay fever until after they are toddlers. Hay fever is associated with reactions to the pollens that cross-react with the foods. Those with PFAS typically have allergy to either tree, weed, and/or grass pollens.

""Research has shown that adults who are receive allergy shots see improvement in PFAS symptoms, but the effect hasn't been widely shown in pediatric patients,"" says Dr. Jones. ""We think it's an important finding, especially for kids who are receiving allergy shots and also suffering from PFAS.""",0
363,"Approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis when cancer spreads and forms new tumors. The liver is considered the most vulnerable organ to metastatic cancer: the 5-year survival rate after surgery to remove liver metastases is as low as 30-50%, so developing treatments to prevent liver metastasis is urgently needed.

A group of researchers including graduate student Truong Huu Hoang and Professor Norifumi Kadawa from the Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, and Associate Professor Misako Matsubara from the Graduate School of Veterinary Science, has identified an alternative pathway for liver metastasis, showing that cancer cells invade via intracellular gap formation in endothelial cells, and clarified the molecular mechanism involved. The results of their research are expected to lead to the development of drugs to prevent and treat metastatic liver cancer.

Metastasizing cancer cells are known to change the microenvironment of liver cells in ways that promote metastasis, but the extent of these interactions has not been fully investigated. Cancer cells carried in the bloodstream come into contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which line the blood vessels of the liver to form a protective barrier. LSECs are responsible for the detoxification functions of the liver and have numerous small pores, through which the liquid components of blood and small particles -- but not cancer cells -- can enter the liver. LSECs are constantly exposed to toxic substances carried by the blood that can disrupt these small pores under stressful conditions; this causes larger intracellular gaps to form in the LSECs, weakening the protective barrier. This led the research group to consider that the LSECs' intracellular gaps may be involved in liver metastasis.

The research group created a mouse model of liver metastasis -- by injecting cancer cells into the spleen -- and performed omics analysis to observe changes in the LSECs. They found that when cancer cells moved from the spleen to the liver, they induced the LSECs to produce multiple proteins. The expression of one of these proteins -- matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) -- in LSECs caused the intracellular gaps to form.

Furthermore, using electron microscopy and 3D tomography reconstruction, the researchers showed that cancer cells extended their projections directly into the intracellular gaps of LSECs, allowing them to infiltrate the liver tissue. They found a positive correlation between the number of intracellular gaps in the LSECs and the number of new metastatic liver tumors that formed in the mice. However, new tumors could be prevented from forming by treating the mice with a MMP9 inhibitor, suggesting that MMP9 is a promising therapeutic target to prevent liver metastasis.

Professor Matsubara concluded, ""In this study, we discovered a new phenomenon related to metastasis: cancer cells induce LSEC intracellular gap formation and infiltrate the liver through those gaps. With these results we are continuing our research to develop new treatments for liver metastasis, targeting intracellular gap formation in LSECs.""",0
365,"Scientists could be a step closer to providing more precise pollen forecasts to the 25% of the UK population who live with either asthma or hay fever.

This follows the first results of a major three-year project to analyse airborne grass pollen.

The first year's findings, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, have shown that it is not just the overall 'load' of grass pollen in the air that could cause those particularly bad days for asthma and hay fever sufferers. Days which see increased asthma attacks or intense hay fever could be related to the release of pollen from particular grass species.

Current pollen 'counts' and forecasts assess the whole load of pollen in the air, and, while scientists can distinguish between the pollen created by individual tree and weed species, it has proven virtually impossible for the current forecast methods to visually identify different grass pollens.

Step forward metabarcoding, a technique which enables scientists to automatically identify any fragments of material caught in a sample of air, water or soil, by recognising and matching its unique DNA 'barcode'.

For the first time, grass pollens collected over the course of one allergy season have been analysed using this high-tech method. This has enabled the team to start investigating links between certain pollen types and those days on which plant allergy sufferers and people with asthma are most affected.

Prof Simon Creer, of Bangor University, who is leading the research explains:

""I'm a hay fever sufferer myself, and I know that on some days, despite a high pollen forecast, I can be less affected than on other days when the forecast appears to be lower. This led me and others to wonder whether it's the high load of pollen alone that causes the problem, or whether the different grass pollens cause different levels of reaction.""

Dr Georgina Brennan, from Bangor University who analysed the aerial pollen ""environmental DNA"" with Dr Caitlin Potter from the University of Aberystwyth and the National Botanic Garden Wales, added:

""Bringing a range of specialists together has enabled us to find initial answers. Our task is now to develop a clearer picture of where the pollen comes from, how it moves through the air and how different types of pollen can be linked to allergies.""

Dr Ben Wheeler of University of Exeter said: ""We are now investigating datasets on hospital admissions and GP prescriptions for certain pharmaceutical products to identify correlations between healthcare data and increases in particular grass pollens. With these new insights into pollen characterization, we are focusing on future implications for pollen warnings and self-care strategies.""

Dr Rachel McInnes from the UK Met Office added: ""Leading on from this new environment DNA research, we are currently developing maps of where these species of allergenic grasses are located in the UK. When combined with aerial modelling approaches being developed with Prof. Carsten Skjøth at the University of Worcester, the approaches could be used to improve our pollen forecast in the future.""",0

371,"Researchers at Yale have identified a possible treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disease for which there is currently no cure or treatment, by targeting an enzyme that had been considered ""undruggable."" The finding appears in the Aug. 25 edition of Science Signaling.

DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease that leads to progressive weakness and eventual loss of the skeletal and heart muscles. It occurs in 16 of 100,000 male births in the U.S. People with the disease exhibit clumsiness and weakness in early childhood and typically need wheelchairs by the time they reach their teens. The average life expectancy is 26.

While earlier research had revealed the crucial role played by an enzyme called MKP5 in the development of DMD, making it a promising target for possible treatment, scientists for decades had been unable to disrupt this family of enzymes, known as protein tyrosine phosphatases, at the enzymes' ""active"" site where chemical reactions occur.

In the new study, Anton Bennett, the Dorys McConnell Duberg Professor of Pharmacology and professor of comparative medicine, and his team screened over 162,000 compounds. They identified one molecular compound that blocked the enzyme's activity by binding to a previously undiscovered allosteric site -- a spot near the enzyme's active site.

""There have been many attempts to design inhibitors for this family of enzymes, but those compounds have failed to produce the right properties,"" Bennett said. ""Until now, the family of enzymes has been considered 'undruggable.'""

By targeting the allosteric site of MKP5 instead, he said, ""We discovered an excellent starting point for drug development that circumvented the earlier problems.""

The researchers tested their compound in muscle cells and found that it successfully inhibited MKP5 activity, suggesting a promising new therapeutic strategy for treating DMD.

The research was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant through the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, as well as by the Blavatnik Fund for Innovation at Yale, which annually presents awards to support the most promising life science discoveries from Yale faculty.

Bennett said that the Blavatnik funding, which is administered by the Yale Office of Cooperative Research, was critical in moving the research forward. ""It resulted in a license with a major pharmaceutical company,"" he said, ""and we hope they will rapidly move forward with the development of the new treatment.""

The finding has implications well beyond muscular dystrophy, he added. The researchers have demonstrated that the MKP5 enzyme is broadly implicated in fibrosis, or the buildup of scar tissue, a condition that contributes to nearly one-third of natural deaths worldwide.

""Fibrosis is involved in the end-stage death of many tissues, including liver, lung, and muscle,"" Bennett said. ""We believe this enzyme could be a target more broadly for fibrotic tissue disease.""

374,"Patients with vitamin D deficiency who received vitamin D supplements had a reduced need for pain relief and lower levels of fatigue in palliative cancer treatment, a randomized and placebo-controlled study by researchers at Karolinska Institutet shows. The study is published in the scientific journal Cancers.

Among patients with cancer in the palliative phase, vitamin D deficiency is common. Previous studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D in the blood may be associated with pain, sensitivity to infection, fatigue, depression, and lower self-rated quality of life.

A previous smaller study, which was not randomized or placebo-controlled, suggested that vitamin D supplementation could reduce opioid doses, reduce antibiotic use, and improve the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer.

244 cancer patients with palliative cancer, enrolled in ASIH, (advanced medical home care), took part in the current study in Stockholm during the years 2017-2020.

All study participants had a vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study. They received either 12 weeks of treatment with vitamin D at a relatively high dose (4000 IE/day) or a placebo.

The researchers then measured the change in opioid doses (as a measurement of pain) at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the start of the study.

""The results showed that vitamin D treatment was well tolerated and that the vitamin D-treated patients had a significantly slower increase in opioid doses than the placebo group during the study period. In addition, they experienced less cancer-related fatigue compared to the placebo group,"" says Linda Björkhem-Bergman, senior physician at Stockholms Sjukhem and associate professor at the Department of Neurobiology, Healthcare Sciences, and Society, Karolinska Institutet.

On the other hand, there was no difference between the groups in terms of self-rated quality of life or antibiotic use.

""The effects were quite small, but statistically significant and may have clinical significance for patients with vitamin D deficiency who have cancer in the palliative phase. This is the first time it has been shown that vitamin D treatment for palliative cancer patients can have an effect on both opioid-sensitive pain and fatigue,"" says first author of the study Maria Helde Frankling, senior physician at ASIH and postdoc at the Department of Neurobiology, Healthcare Science and Society, Karolinska Institutet.

The study is one of the largest drug studies conducted within ASIH in Sweden. One weakness of the study is the large drop-out rate. Only 150 out of 244 patients were able to complete the 12-week study because many patients died of their cancer during the study.

The study was funded by Region Stockholm (ALF), the Swedish Cancer Society, Stockholms Sjukhems Foundation and was carried out with the support of ASIH Stockholm Södra and ASIH Stockholm Norr.",0

377,"Treatment of severe infections caused by pathogenic bacteria relies on 'last resort' antibiotics, but rising resistance by 'superbugs' to most clinically approved drugs leaves patients exposed to possible fatalities.

Flinders University researchers are focusing on how bacterial cells adapt and resist antimicrobial medications -- with a new article focusing on a hospital strain of Acinetobacter baumannii and its cellular response to important antibiotic colistin.

The World Health Organization names antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development with a growing number of infections -- including pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and salmonellosis -- becoming harder to treat as antibiotics used to treat them become less effective.

""Around the world, there are fewer and fewer new antibiotics being identified and produced for medical use -- and this is compounded by the ever-increasing antibiotic resistance seen in bacterial strains causing infections,"" says Flinders microbial researcher Dr Sarah Giles.

""If we can understand the bacterial mechanisms, such as this, we can potentially apply new therapies to treat patients -- particularly those with multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections.""

As part of a NHMRC-Flinders University Research Scholarship study, Dr Giles and other authors noted that the A. baumannii bacterial strain had a two-part signal system which altered its potential response to antibiotic treatment.

This 'two-component signal transduction' observed involves a response regulator protein in the StkR/S system acting as a repressor and when genetically removed hundreds of transcriptional changes are seen.

Some of these changes affect the bacterial cell's outer membrane composition leading to colistin resistance.

""Colistin is known as a 'last resort' antibiotic and therefore identifying and understanding the mechanisms contributing to bacterial antibiotic-resistant is critical,"" says senior researcher Professor Melissa Brown.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and even death.",0
378,"A new analysis suggests that teens prefer mint and mango as their vaping flavors of choice for e-cigarettes. Previous research showed that teens were attracted to nicotine vaping by the candy and fruit-flavored products offered by manufacturers. Products and trends are quickly evolving, and estimates of the specific e-cigarette flavors teens use are lacking; therefore, scientists wanted to find out which flavors are now preferred by teens. The report, published in JAMA, was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products. NIDA and NCI are parts of the National Institutes of Health.

The study focused on JUUL products, the most widely used brand, which is available in multiple flavors. Data were from the 2019 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, which annually surveys eighth, 10th, and 12th grade students in U.S. schools. A randomly-selected third of MTF respondents were asked, “Which JUUL flavor do you use most often?”

The 2019 data suggests that among both 12th and 10th graders, mint and mango ranked first and second (at about 47% and 24% for seniors; 44% and 27% for 10th graders). Among eighth graders, mango was most popular at 34%, followed by mint at 29%. In all grades, fruit flavoring was ranked third, followed by “Other.” Menthol was among the least popular (less than 2.3% for eighth graders; less than 3% for 10th graders and less than 6% for seniors).

The overall 2019 Monitoring the Future vaping data released last month showed a significant increase in past month vaping of nicotine in each of the three grade levels since last year. Additional findings from the 2019 Monitoring the Future Survey, documenting the use of and attitudes about marijuana, alcohol and other drugs, will be released in December.

382,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― Homelessness has become a social crisis and public health problem around the world, affecting people of all ages. Most homeless people are at a disadvantage with few resources, and may or may not have adequate health insurance. Mental illness and substance abuse are common issues in the homeless community. People living on the streets have a high likelihood of developing heart disease. Yet they have little ability to take care of their health.

A new study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings examined in-hospital outcomes and 30-day readmission rates of 3,937 homeless patients from more than 1.5 million people admitted for a heart attack. Researchers used two years of data (2015–2016) from the National Readmission Database. The findings show that homeless patients often receive less treatment and are more likely to end up readmitted to the hospital within a month.

""The differences in patterns of care and clinical outcomes between homeless and nonhomeless patients are likely a reflection of the differences in risk profile at baseline,"" says Mohamad Alkhouli, M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and senior author of the study.

Compared to those with stable housing, homeless patients admitted with a heart attack tended to be male, about 10 years younger, and had fewer traditional risk factors for heart disease. Homeless patients in the study had a higher incidence of congestive heart failure, anemia, chronic kidney disease, and liver and lung diseases. Anxiety, depression, substance abuse and HIV infections were substantially higher for this group, as well.

Looking at matched outcomes for each group, homeless patients received less treatment in the hospital, as shown through a lower rate of angiography and revascularization. The in-hospital mortality rate and median cost of hospitalization were similar for the homeless versus patients who were not homeless.

Other differences emerged when comparing length of stay and readmission. Homeless patients were in the hospital longer. Yet they were more likely to leave against medical advice and be discharged to an intermediate care facility. They were also more likely to be readmitted. The 30-day readmission rates differed significantly, with 22.5% of homeless patients readmitted, compared to only 10% of patients who were not homeless. Cardiovascular causes were the most common reasons for readmission in both groups. However, 18% of homeless patients were readmitted for psychiatric causes, compared to 2% of patients who were not homeless.

""Addressing cardiovascular disease in the growing population of the homeless comes with a unique set of challenges,"" says Dr. Alkhouli. ""The high burden of psychiatric illness among the homeless emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to address both the clinical and social needs of these patients.""

384,"Gold nanotubes -- tiny hollow cylinders one thousandth the width of a human hair -- could be used to treat mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, according to a team of researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Leeds.

In a study published today in journal Small, the researchers demonstrate that once inside the cancer cells, the nanotubes absorb light, causing them to heat up, thereby killing the cells.

More than 2,600 people are diagnosed in the UK each year with mesothelioma, a malignant form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. Although the use of asbestos is outlawed in the UK now, the country has the world's highest levels of mesothelioma because it imported vast amounts of asbestos in the post-war years. The global usage of asbestos remains high, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which means mesothelioma will become a global problem.

""Mesothelioma is one of the 'hard-to-treat' cancers, and the best we can offer people with existing treatments is a few months of extra survival,"" said Dr Arsalan Azad from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research at the University of Cambridge. ""There's an important unmet need for new, effective treatments.""

In 2018, the University of Cambridge was awarded £10million from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to help develop engineering solutions, including nanotech, to find ways to address hard-to-treat cancers.

In a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and University of Leeds, researchers have developed a form of gold nanotubes whose physical properties are 'tunable' -- in other words, the team can tailor the wall thickness, microstructure, composition, and ability to absorb particular wavelengths of light.

The researchers added the nanotubes to mesothelioma cells cultured in the lab and found that they were absorbed by the cells, residing close to the nucleus, where the cell's DNA lies. When the team targeted the cells with a laser, the nanotubes absorbed the light and heated up, killing the mesothelioma cell.

Professor Stefan Marciniak, also from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, added: ""The mesothelioma cells 'eat' the nanotubes, leaving them susceptible when we shine light on them. Laser light is able to penetrate deep into tissue without causing damage to surrounding tissue. It then gets absorbed by the nanotubes, which heat up and, we hope in the future, could be used to cause localised cancer-cell killing.""

The team will be developing the work further to ensure the nanotubes are targeted to cancer cells with less effect on normal tissue.

The nanotubes are made in a two-step process. First, solid silver nanorods are created of the desired diameter. Gold is then deposited from solution onto the surface of the silver. As the gold builds-up at the surface, the silver dissolves from the inside to leave a hollow nanotube.

The approach advanced by the Leeds team allows these nanotubes to be developed at room temperature, which should make their manufacture at scale more feasible.

Professor Stephen Evans from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leeds said: ""Having control over the size and shape of the nanotubes allows us to tune them to absorb light where the tissue is transparent and will allow them to be used for both the imaging and treatment of cancers. The next stage will be to load these nanotubes with medicines for enhanced therapies.""",0

386,"Results from a Michigan Medicine study reveal that targeting a protein found in the skin may reduce the severity of psoriasis.

Interferons play a major role in activating the body's response to viral threats, but they have also been detected in the lesions of many psoriasis patients at abnormal levels. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes overproduction of skin cells and impacts nearly 30 million people in the world.

Using a model that mimics psoriasis in mice, researchers found that changing the levels of interferon kappa, a protein made by skin cells, altered the severity of inflammation and production of cell signaling molecules, called cytokines, that induce inflammation characteristic of psoriasis. Investigators found more psoriasis-like inflammation when more interferon kappa was present, while decreasing interferon kappa levels reduced disease.

The findings, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, suggest using therapies to modulate interferon states may limit inflammation in psoriasis patients.

""We've known that psoriatic inflammation is marked by interferon-related gene expression, but how interferons alter the severity of the disease has not been clear,"" said J. Michelle Kahlenberg, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of rheumatology at Michigan Medicine and senior author of the paper. ""Understanding how interferon kappa may modulate psoriasis brings us one step closer to optimizing our treatments.""

The research team induced psoriasis in mouse models, splitting them into groups with interferon kappa at low, normal or elevated levels. The overexpressed protein alone didn't induce the disease, but it primed the skin for the inflammatory response that followed.

""This work shows how the context of the skin environment can shape inflammatory responses."" said Mehrnaz Gharaee-Kermani, DVM, M.P.H., Ph.D., lead author of the study and a senior research lab specialist at Michigan Medicine. ""It will be exciting to see how this can be applied in clinic.""

The research team is conducting further studies to understand the role of interferon kappa in psoriasis patients through their Taubman Institute-sponsored study at Michigan Medicine and in partnership with Johann E. Gudhonsson, M.D., Ph.D., receiving funding through the National Psoriasis Foundation. Several treatments are used against the disease, but there is no cure.

A few current psoriasis drugs inhibit interferons, but many that are more specific are still in the trial phase. Coupled with the study's findings, personalized medicine will be paramount as physicians attempt to treat this disease, Kahlenberg said.

""Until now, treatments have been tested by studying a drug in hundreds of patients, lumping the average of them all together and targeting the average of those patients,"" Kahlenberg said. ""As any patient who has been on these medications will tell you, this trial-and-error approach wastes patient time and money trying to get control of the disease. Understanding a patient's background level of interferon might help us target things within that person to make their disease better faster and stay in remission.""",0
387,"New study links severe sleep apnea to higher blood glucose levels in African Americans

Suggests that targeting sleep may help prevent diabetes and improve treatment.

African Americans with severe sleep apnea and other adverse sleep patterns are much more likely to have high blood glucose levels — a risk factor for diabetes — than those without these patterns, according to a new study funded in part by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The findings suggest that better sleep habits may lead to better blood glucose control and prove beneficial for type 2 diabetes prevention and diabetes management in African Americans, who are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes than other groups. They also point to the importance of screening for sleep apnea to help fight the potential for uncontrolled blood sugar in this high-risk group, the researchers said.



 Previous studies have linked disturbed sleep patterns, including sleep apnea, to increased blood glucose levels in white and Asian populations. But this new study is one of the few to use objective measurements to link these disturbed sleep patterns to increased blood glucose levels in black men and women, the researchers said. Their findings appear online on April 28 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.



 “The study underscores the importance of developing interventions to promote regular sleep schedules, particularly in those with diabetes,” said Yuichiro Yano, M.D., Ph.D., the lead study author and a researcher in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at Duke University. “It also reaffirms the need to improve the screening and diagnosis of sleep apnea, both in African Americans and other groups.”

Michael Twery, Ph.D., director of the NHLBI’s National Center on Sleep Disorders Research, added that the study highlights important associations between untreated sleep apnea and poorly-regulated blood sugar. “It also adds to growing evidence that protecting our sleep, like diet and exercise, may help reduce the risk of diabetes and the related risk of cardiovascular disease.”



 For the study, the researchers evaluated sleep patterns while concurrently measuring blood glucose markers among 789 black men and women who were enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, the largest study of cardiovascular disease in African-Americans. Most of the participants—74%—were women, 25% had type 2 diabetes, 20% were taking diabetes medication, and about 57% had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea but were not receiving treatment for their condition, Yano said. Their mean age was 63 years.



 Participants completed at-home sleep apnea tests, and each used a wrist actigraph watch, a tool that measures wakefulness and sleep, for seven days. The test calculated sleep duration (short vs long), sleep efficiency, night-to-night variability in sleep duration, and sleep fragmentation (multiple disruptions during sleep). The researchers obtained several measures of glucose metabolism, including fasting blood glucose concentration, HbA1c levels, and insulin resistance.



 The researchers focused on four main groups: regular sleepers (no sleep apnea), those with mild sleep apnea, moderate sleep apnea, and severe sleep apnea. During the course of the study, they found that those with the severe sleep apnea had 14% higher fasting blood glucose levels compared to those without sleep apnea. Severe sleep apnea was also associated with higher HbA1c levels, Yano said.



 In addition to studying sleep apnea, the researchers found that participants who experienced other types of disturbed sleep—including sleep fragmentation and sleep duration variability—were also more likely to have increased measures of blood glucose. The associations between disturbed sleep and high blood glucose levels were stronger in participants with diabetes compared to those without diabetes, the researchers said. In those without diabetes, disturbed sleep was also associated with increased insulin resistance.

Yano and his team also found that associations of sleep apnea and high blood glucose levels were stronger among black men than black women. Black men with severe sleep apnea had 10% higher fasting blood glucose levels than black women with severe sleep apnea in the study.

The researchers noted interventions that treat sleep apnea might help improve blood glucose management, including the use of continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) machines — devices that deliver air through a mask to keep the airway open when worn during sleep — and the encouragement of better sleep patterns in blacks, particularly in those with diabetes. But further studies will be needed to determine if such interventions will be effective, Yano said.

389,"A mechanism for how the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, evolves has been discovered at Umeå University, Sweden. The discovery concerns how proteins with a defect structure spread the deformation to other proteins, according to results in a new thesis. The discovery can open up for novel pharmaceutical developments in the future.

""We've been able to identify two different types of protein aggregates with different structures and propagation abilities. One type gave rise to a more aggressive disease progression, which shows that these aggregates are the driving force in the development of ALS,"" says Johan Bergh, doctoral student at the Department of Medical Biosciences at Umeå University, Sweden.

Together with the ALS group at Umeå University, Johan Bergh has developed a method of investigating protein aggregates formed in ALS. With this new method, it has then been possible to identify the particular protein aggregates that are driving in the emergence of ALS.

The protein that has been targeted is superoxid dismutas-1, SOD1. It has long been known that mutations in that protein can cause ALS. The goal of the research team was to investigate the way in which the protein contributes to the disease.

In several diseases afflicting the nervous system, such as in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, new studies show that some proteins assume an abberant structure. Misfolded proteins aggregate and provoke other proteins of the same kind to assume the same structure. In this way, the disease spreads step by step into the nervous system.

""Using the new method, we have shown and confirmed through animal models that the development of ALS follows the same principle as for other severe nervous disorders. Protein aggregates function as a template that healthy proteins stick to and cause the disease to spread,"" says Johan Bergh.

In animal models, agregates of the SOD1 protein from animals, as well as humans, have been shown to induce ALS disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which afflicts approximately 250 people annually in Sweden. Although the disease has been known for over 100 years, there is still only one medicine with a disease delaying effect available in Sweden.

""Through our new method, I hope that in the future, drugs will be developed specifically aimed at attacking these protein aggregates. Hopefully, research teams focusing on similar diseases will adopt the method. However, we are in an early phase, and developing drugs is a long-term process,"" says Johan Bergh.

391,"Experimental PfSPZ malaria vaccine provides durable protection against multiple strains in NIH clinical trial

An investigational malaria vaccine has protected a small number of healthy U.S. adults from infection with a malaria strain different from that contained in the vaccine, according to a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, sponsored and co-conducted the Phase 1 clinical trial.

Malaria is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, which inject immature malaria parasites called sporozoites into a person’s bloodstream. The parasites travel to the liver, where they mature, multiply and spread via the bloodstream throughout the body causing malaria symptoms including chills, fever, headache, nausea, sweating and fatigue. According to the World Health Organization, 214 million people were infected with malaria globally in 2015 and 438,000 people died, mostly young African children. The species Plasmodium falciparum is the most common cause of malaria morbidity and mortality in Africa. In the United States, travel-related malaria is a concern for international tourists, aid workers and military personnel worldwide.

The PfSPZ Vaccine used in this study was developed by Sanaria Inc., of Rockville, Maryland. The vaccine contains weakened P. falciparum sporozoites that do not cause infection but are able to generate a protective immune response against live malaria infection. Earlier research at the NIH Clinical Center with the PfSPZ Vaccine found it to be safe, well-tolerated and protective for more than a year when tested in healthy U.S. adults against a single Africa-derived malaria strain matched to the PfSPZ Vaccine.

“An effective malaria vaccine will need to protect people living in endemic areas against multiple strains of the mosquito-borne disease,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “These new findings showing cross-protection with the PfSPZ Vaccine suggest that it may be able to accomplish this goal.”

The study enrolled 31 healthy adults ages 18 to 45 years, and was led by Julie E. Ledgerwood, D.O. of NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC), and Kirsten E. Lyke, M.D. of the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development in Baltimore. Participants were assigned to receive three doses of the PfSPZ Vaccine at eight-week intervals by rapid intravenous injection.

Nineteen weeks after receiving the final dose of the test vaccine, participants who received the vaccine and a group of non-vaccinated volunteers were exposed in a controlled setting to bites from mosquitoes infected with the same strain of P. falciparum parasites (NF54, from Africa) that were used to manufacture PfSPZ Vaccine.

Nine of the 14 participants (64 percent) who received PfSPZ Vaccine demonstrated no evidence of malaria parasites; all six of the non-vaccinated participants who were challenged at the same time had malaria parasites in their blood.

Of the nine participants who showed no evidence of malaria, six participants were again exposed in a controlled setting to mosquito bites, this time from mosquitoes infected with a different strain of P. falciparum parasite, 33 weeks after the final immunization. In this group, 5 of the 6 participants (83 percent) were protected against malaria infection; none of the six participants who did not receive the vaccine and were challenged were protected. All participants who became infected with malaria immediately received medical treatment.

“Achieving durable protection against a malaria strain different from the vaccine strain, over eight months after vaccination, is an indication of this vaccine’s potential,” said Robert A. Seder, M.D., chief of the Cellular Immunology Section of NIAID's Vaccine Research Center and senior author of the PNAS paper. “If we can build on these findings with the PfSPZ Vaccine and induce higher efficacy, we may be on our way to a vaccine that could effectively protect people against a variety of malaria parasites where the disease is prevalent.”

The research team found that the PfSPZ Vaccine activated T cells, a key component of the body’s defenses against malaria, and induced antibody responses in all vaccine recipients. Vaccine-specific T-cell responses were comparable when measured against both of the malaria challenge strains, providing some insights into how the vaccine was mediating protection.

Ongoing research will determine whether protective efficacy can be improved by changes to the PfSPZ Vaccine dose and number of immunizations. Accordingly, a Phase 2 efficacy trial testing three different dosages in a three-dose vaccine regimen is now underway in 5-to 12-month-old infants in Western Kenya to assess safety and efficacy against natural infection.

Sanaria Inc., designed, manufactured, and provided PfSPZ Vaccine and the heterologous challenge mosquitoes. NIAID supported the development of the experimental vaccine through several Small Business Innovation Research grants: 5R44AI055229-11, 5R44AI058499-08, and 5R44AI058375-08.

399,"Viruses use the molecular repertoire of the host cell to replicate. Researchers from the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation2 at the University of Bonn, together with Japanese researchers, want to exploit this for the treatment of influenza. The team led by Prof. Hiroki Kato from the Institute of Cardiovascular Immunology at the University Hospital Bonn has identified a compound that inhibits the body's own methyltransferase MTr1, thereby limiting the replication of influenza viruses. The compound proved effective in lung tissue preparations and mouse studies and showed synergistic effects with already approved influenza drugs. The study is now published in the journal Science.

To replicate, viruses need a host cell. There they introduce their genetic information in the form of the nucleic acids DNA or RNA. These molecular blueprints are used in the host cell to produce new viruses. In order to distinguish foreign from its own nucleic acids, the cell uses a kind of labeling system. Own RNA, for example, is tagged with a molecular cap that identifies it as non-hazardous. This enables the immune system to react specifically to threats.

The molecular cap is a methylated nucleoside: A small molecule attached to the end of the RNA chain. Tagged in this way, the RNA does not trigger an immune response. However, if there is RNA in the cell that lacks the cap structure, it is recognized by the immune receptor RIG-I, and the immune system is alerted. To escape this, influenza viruses have developed a special mechanism. They steal the molecular cap from cellular RNA molecules and transfer it to their own RNA. This process is called cap-snatching.

The enzyme MTr1 provides cellular mRNA with a cap structure and thus functions as the cell's ""nucleic acid labeler."" The team led by Prof. Hiroki Kato of the Institute of Cardiovascular Immunology at the University Hospital Bonn has now been able to show how much influenza viruses depend on the function of the enzyme MTr1. ""While other viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, are able to cap their RNA molecules on their own, influenza viruses rely on stealing existing caps,"" says Yuta Tsukamoto, lead author of the paper. ""If the function of MTr1 is disrupted in the cell, there are no caps available to transfer to viral RNA."" The activity of MTr1 is thus essential for the replication of the influenza virus in the cell.

The researchers want to harness this dependence for the treatment of influenza infections. To this end, they searched for inhibitors that specifically inhibit MTr1. The team investigated how the substances in the infected tissue affect the amount of virus particles produced. The researchers tested this both in mouse models and in human lung tissue preparations. These so-called lung explants come from patients who have undergone lung surgery. ""Among thousands of candidates, we were able to identify a molecule that inhibits MTr1 in human lung explants and also in vivo in mice, curtailing influenza replication,"" reports Prof. Hiroki Kato, a member of the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation2 at the University of Bonn.

The inhibitor is a derivative of a natural product called trifluoromethyl tubercidin (TFMT), which is produced by bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. ""We hope this study will lead to the development of new treatments for influenza,"" says Prof. Hiroki Kato. In the present study, the researchers were already able to demonstrate that TFMT works together with approved drugs against influenza infections. It was even possible to show a clear synergistic effect with regard to the number of virus particles produced in the tissue.

In addition to the University of Bonn and the University Hospital Bonn, the study involved Hokkaido University (Japan), the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Tokyo (Japan), the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology Tokyo (Japan), the University of Tsukuba (Japan), Aarhus University (Denmark), Academia Sinica Taipei (Taiwan) as well as the Universities of Münster, Marburg and Freiburg, the Technical University of Munich and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).

405,"Error-prone DNA replication and repair may lead to mutations and cancer in individuals who inherit a mutant copy of the BRCA1 gene, according to a new study by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The discovery has potential implications for preventing the development of cancer in patients with these mutations.

The study, published Sept. 12 in Molecular Cell, provides new insights into why individuals who inherit a mutation in one copy of the BRCA1 gene often develop mutations in their remaining normal copy of the BRCA1 gene, setting the stage for tumors to develop. When these individuals' cells are under stress, replication of the normal BRCA1 gene stalls because of the highly repetitive DNA sequences in the gene that create physical barriers to machinery that copies DNA. To fix the stall, an error-prone DNA repair mechanism kicks in.

""We have identified some of the first steps in cancer development in people carrying inherited BRCA1 mutations,"" said the study's senior author Dr. Jeannine Gerhardt, assistant professor of stem cell biology in obstetrics and gynecology and the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.

The BRCA1 gene encodes an important DNA-repair protein, explained the study's lead author Dr. Madhura Deshpande, a research associate in the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Deshpande said that people who inherit one mutant and one normal copy produce about half as much of this DNA-repair protein as people with two normal copies.

To understand why the remaining functional BRCA1 gene copy often becomes mutated too, the team studied the DNA replication in human embryonic stem cells as well as human breast epithelial cells with one mutant copy of the BRCA1 gene. The human embryonic stem cells were generated in the Center for Reproductive Medicine by Dr. Nikica Zaninovic and Dr. Zev Rosenwaks. They exposed the cells to a chemical to mimic environmental stress on the cells. They discovered that as the DNA in these cells unzips into two strands to make a copy of the DNA for each new cell, the machinery that copies the DNA stalls at the BRCA1 gene because of the gene's repetitive DNA sequences. The team also demonstrated for what is believed to be the first time that the BRCA genes are fragile sites and are prone to breakage. Because the cells only have half as much of the BRCA1 protein available to repair the breaks, the cells turn to a more error-prone backup DNA repair mechanism called microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR), Dr. Deshpande explained.

The team also examined tumor cells from women with breast cancer linked to inherited BRCA1 mutations. They found mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, like deletions and insertions, likely caused by the faulty MMBIR process.

""We are currently interested in finding other additional error-prone repair mechanisms that might contribute to the genomic instability and mutagenesis in these cells,"" Dr. Deshpande said. Dr. Gerhardt said the team is simultaneously looking to identify the real-life environmental stressors that trigger replication problems and faulty DNA repair in BRCA1-linked breast cancers.

The team is also working to develop strategies to prevent the use of error-prone DNA repair mechanisms in women with inherited BRCA1 mutations. For example, they are testing the protective effects of dietary compounds that are linked to reduced breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers. If they are successful, they may be able to identify drugs or other interventions that could prevent cancer in women with inherited BRCA1 mutations and provide an alternative to the existing invasive preventive measures like pre-emptive mastectomy or ovary removal.

""I believe we can intervene and find compounds that will prevent patients with inherited BRCA1 mutations from accumulating mutations that lead to cancer,"" Dr. Gerhardt said.",0

410,"June 24, 2022 – Hours go by with you tossing and turning, with no hope of escape into comfy, restful sleep. Or worse, you’re exhausted with no chance of dozing off before the dreaded morning alarm. If this isn’t you, it may be someone very close to you, suggest the results of a new survey. A report published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) that featured more than 2,000 Americans found that almost 3 in 10 have insomnia, and more than half may be self-medicating. What’s more, 28% of the people in the study reported that insomnia worsened their lives and daily routines. The survey also found that nearly one-third of Americans reported new or worsening sleep problems since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While insomnia can lead to trouble falling or staying asleep, chronic insomnia may do more damage than bad sleep, commonly making anxiety, depression, and pain worse, according to an insomnia study published in the journal Medical Clinics of North America.

Dealing with insomnia and conditions that come with it could explain why 64% of Americans reported using sleep aids or medications to help ease their insomnia. More than one-fourth (27%) of people in the study regularly use melatonin, 23% use prescription medications, and 20% use marijuana orcannabidiol (also known as CBD) to fall or stay asleep. Meanwhile, nearly 4 in 10 (37%) of those who take sleep aids said they used the products more throughout the pandemic. Sleep aids like melatonin can work well with the right guidance, according to the Medical Clinics of North America study. But when researchers took a look at the different medications and supplements for insomnia, they found some cause for concern. Dietary sleep aids, including valerian, kava-kava, and skullcap, are unregulated and require more evidence to prove that they work. Even melatonin should not be used for chronic insomnia, according to the AASM clinical guidelines, which is advice for chronic insomnia treatment from experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology. According to the guidelines, these treatments could help the people in the study with insomnia and others with this condition:

417,"Sept. 9, 2022 -- A highly infectious form of the bird flu has been identified in a dolphin in Florida and a porpoise in Sweden, according to The New York Times. The virus has devastated bird populations in North America and Europe throughout the past year. However, this is the first time the virus has been detected in cetaceans, a group of marine mammals that includes dolphins, porpoises, and whales. “The key takeaway for us is that additional caution should be taken by those handling or encountering wild dolphins during rescue events or while performing necropsies,” Mike Walsh, a clinical associate professor at the University of Florida, said in a statement. Walsh led the animal rescue team and helped to perform the necropsy on a bottlenose dolphin that became trapped and died in a canal in Florida’s Dixie County in March. The team found that the young male dolphin was infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, or HPAIV, which had spread to its brain and lungs. The dolphin had the same strain that has been spread widely by birds this year. Researchers can’t say for sure whether the virus led to the dolphin’s death or how it became infected, but they suspect the dolphin interacted with a wild bird that died from the virus. “These animals are always curious about their environment and checking things out,” Walsh told the newspaper. “So if he came up on a sick, either dying or dead, bird, he might be very curious about it. He might mouth it.” Last week, Swedish veterinary officials announced that they found the same influenza strain in a stranded porpoise, which died in June. The virus was located in several of the animal’s organs, including the brain. The discovery of the virus in two different species on two different continents indicates that there have “almost certainly” been other cases, Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee, told the newspaper. “Our surveillance activities on a global scale are never sensitive enough to pick up the only two events of this kind,” Webby said.

Webby is now working with the Florida research team on follow-up studies. He said the virus has become so widespread in birds this year that researchers wouldn’t be surprised to see it show up in other species as well. “Unfortunately, I think this is maybe just sort of a sign of what’s to come should this virus not disappear,” he added. For now, the risk to humans remains low, according to the CDC. In the U.S., only one person has become infected with the current circulating strain. In April, a person in Colorado tested positive for the bird flu strain after having direct exposure to infected poultry. The person was isolated, treated with an antiviral drug, and recovered after only experiencing fatigue for a few days. At the same time, the virus still poses a risk to wildlife and could mutate to better infect mammals, the newspaper reported. The current strain, known as Eurasian H5N1, has infected tens of millions of domestic poultry in the U.S., as well as wild birds such as eagles, owls, and pelicans. In addition, other mammals have been infected this year after interacting with wild birds, including bobcats, foxes, skunks, and seals. So far, researchers haven’t found evidence that cetaceans are spreading the virus, Webby told the newspaper. They also haven’t seen any signs that the virus has picked up mutations associated with mammals. Given the two recent infections, though, they will begin to look for the virus more proactively. “Now everybody’s going to be on guard for this,” he said. “And that’ll help tell us how serious this really is for cetaceans on the coastlines.”",0

426,"A six-year study of nearly 100,000 women in Botswana has provided new evidence that relatively inexpensive daily diet supplementation of iron, folic acid and vitamin supplementation in pregnancy can reduce complications at birth. Researchers found that iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS), as well as iron and folic acid plus essential vitamins and trace minerals (multiple micronutrient supplementation, or MMS), are associated with significantly lower rates of babies born at low birthweight and other complications at birth, compared to iron or folic acid alone. For example, the rate of low-birthweight birth was under 10.5 percent for women supplementing their diets with multiple micronutrients, the lowest rate of any comparison group.

Published in Lancet Global Health, the study was led by Ellen Caniglia, ScD, an assistant professor of Epidemiology in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as investigators at the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The results represent a broad, real-world confirmation of earlier clinical trial results. The study, the largest ever of its kind, also included a substantial cohort of pregnant women with HIV, and found that IFAS and MMS appeared to have even larger benefits in this group.

""Our results support the current World Health Organization recommendation that pregnant women should take iron and folic acid supplementation daily, but also provide compelling evidence that multiple micronutrient supplementation has further advantages over IFAS,"" Caniglia said.

About 15 to 20 percent of children born every year around the world have low birthweight, defined as a weight less than 2.5 kg at birth. Commonly occurring with preterm birth, low birthweight is associated with significantly increased risks of childhood illnesses and death, and diseases later in life such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The highest rates of low-birthweight births occur in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

To help reduce the rate of babies born at low birthweight and related complications at birth, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends daily IFAS throughout pregnancy, in all settings, based on substantial clinical trial evidence. There is also clinical trial evidence that daily prenatal MMS, which includes iron and folic acid plus vitamins (A, C, D, E, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12) and minerals/metals (iodine, selenium, zinc, copper), may be superior to IFAS.

However, there has been a need for more evidence for MMS's benefits, especially with respect to IFAS, in real-world settings, and in high-risk women such as women with HIV. The new study provides proof that the approach can help.

Caniglia and colleagues examined supplement use and birth outcomes among 96,341 women who were seen between 2014 and 2020 in a group of government hospitals in Botswana. The sample patients studied represents a large proportion of all births in Botswana in the time period. Supplement initiation was relatively easy to track in the sample because the pills were prescribed and provided free of charge by the participating hospitals. The researchers analyzed how the rates of low-birthweight and other complications at birth, such as preterm or very preterm delivery, stillbirth, and neonatal death, varied according to the supplements each woman began taking during her pregnancy.

Women who initiated IFAS had clearly lower rates of most adverse birth outcomes, compared to women who took only iron or folic acid. Rates of low-birthweight births, for example, were 16.92 percent in the folic acid-only group and 12.70 percent in the iron-only group, but only 11.46 percent in the IFAS group.

Compared to IFAS, women who initiated MMS use saw significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, very preterm delivery, low birthweight, very low birthweight, and caesarean delivery. The rate of low-birthweight birth, for example, was 10.48 percent for women on MMS. Similarly, the rate of preterm birth was 12.68 percent for the women taking IFAS, and 11.63 percent for those taking MMS.

HIV infection is unusually prevalent in Botswana, and nearly a quarter of the pregnant women in the study were living with the virus. The analysis revealed that among these women, the differences in rates of adverse outcomes between MMS and IFAS, and between IFAS and folic acid or iron alone, were generally larger than those seen in HIV-negative women -- suggesting that supplementation has greater benefits for this population.

""We don't really know why this is -- possibly, pregnant women with HIV are more likely to be micronutrient deficient,"" Caniglia said.

The data suggested that women over 35 years old also seemed to derive greater benefit from IFAS or MMS, compared to younger women.

While the study illuminated the comparative benefits of prenatal supplements, it also highlighted the problem of supplement shortages or ""stock-outs."" Throughout the study period, IFAS was universally recommended by WHO for pregnant women, yet more than 43 percent of the women in the study received iron alone, folic acid alone, or no supplement at all, apparently due to these stock shortages.

""This highlights the need for new strategies to improve prenatal supplementation coverage among pregnant women,"" Caniglia said.

She and her colleagues plan to conduct further studies in Botswana, aimed at understanding barriers to the use of prenatal supplements and demonstrating the value of these supplements in improving birth outcomes.

430,"Despite new therapies, Multiple Myeloma (MM) remains incurable causing most patients to ultimately develop drug resistance and succumb to the disease. The pursuit of drugs that inhibit cell cycle regulators especially cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), has been an intense focus of research in cancer. A new study by researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has shown that targeting both CDK4 and ARK5, proteins responsible for maintaining energy balance within the cell, was extremely effective in causing cell death in myeloma. Their research, published in the March issue of the journal Cancer Research, identifies new targets for myeloma drug development.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal blood cancer accounting for over 10,000 deaths in the United States each year. Better understanding of the molecular basis of myeloma has led to a growing list of treatments for this challenging disease. Despite recent advances in new therapies, this disease remains incurable with a median survival of 7 to 8 years.

""Even in the era of great drug development, there is an urgent need an urgent need to develop drugs that are less toxic and achieve longer remissions for all patients,"" said Samir Parekh, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology, and Oncological Sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.

The team along with Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. USA developed a compound, ON123300 that included multi-targeted inhibitors ARK5 and CDK4. The researchers treated both primary myeloma cells and cells line with ARK5/CDK4 inhibitor ON123300 which resulted in tumor cell death, and halted cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo mouse models.

""ARK5 is critical for myeloma survival and this study suggests a novel function for ARK5 in bridging the mTOR and MYC pathways,"" said Deepak Perumal, PhD, lead author of the study and post-doctoral scientist, Hematology and Medical Oncology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Given that MYC is critically over expressed in myeloma, we sought to determine whether selective inhibition of ARK5 and CDK4 could be an effective way to target MYC-driven proliferation in myeloma.""

Researchers evaluated the effect of ARK5/CDK4 inhibitor ON123300 against myeloma cell lines and primary samples from patients with recurring myeloma. Myeloma cells were sensitive to ON123300 while normal peripheral blood cells were spared from the effects of the compound confirming a potent and specific anti-cancer effect of ON123300.

""Our study results show that ON123300 induces cell death and negatively regulates key oncogenic pathways in multiple myeloma cells,"" said Dr. Parekh. ""This is the first report showing potent cytotoxicity of CDK4/ARK5 inhibition in MM and provides the foundation for further clinical trials using CDK4/ARK5 inhibitors to improve outcomes for MM patients.""",0

• A new report states there are now 18 million cancer survivors in the United States, a record number.
• Experts say new treatments and better diagnostic tools that have been developed over the past two decades are major factors in the decline.
• They add that more can be done, particularly in making sure everyone has equal access to healthcare services. While cancer remains a deadly disease that is expected to take the lives of more than in the United States this year, there is some encouraging news to share in the cancer world. More Americans are surviving the disease than ever before, according to a new report from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). The AACR Cancer Progress Report 2022 reports that there are now 18 million cancer survivors in the United States, up from 3 million in 1971. And that number is expected to increase to 26 million by 2040. Cancer death rates in the United States have by 32 percent from 1991 to 2019 – a decrease has saved an estimated 3.5 million lives, according to the American Cancer Society. According to the AARC, “The U.S. cancer death rate is steadily declining, and more people than ever before are living longer and fuller lives after a cancer diagnosis.

In the past three years, the number of cancer survivors in the United States – defined as living people who have had a cancer diagnosis – increased by more than 1 million. “Basic research discoveries have driven the remarkable advances that we’ve seen in cancer medicine in recent years,” Dr. Lisa M. Coussens, the president of the AACR, said in a press statement. “Targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and other new therapeutic approaches being applied clinically all stem from fundamental discoveries in basic science,”’ she said, adding that investment in cancer science is essential to drive the next wave of discoveries and accelerate progress. Declines in smoking and significant improvements in early cancer detection are among the biggest reasons for these positive changes, according to the AACR. The report provides up-to-date cancer incidence, mortality, and survivorship statistics and discusses the latest research in cancer etiology, biology, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based early detection systems and liquid biopsies that are moving rapidly to the clinic. Dr. Peter Bach, the chief medical officer of Baltimore-based Delfi Diagnostics, a developer of liquid biopsy tests for early cancer detection, said of the new report, “These numbers continue to show the progress we’ve made with prevention and early detection. But there’s far more we can do.” Bach noted that remains the number one cancer killer, but the vast majority of people who are eligible for life-saving lung cancer screening don’t get it. “We believe that widely accessible blood cancer screening tests will lead to more people getting screened and continue these positive trends in the age-adjusted cancer death rate,” Bach told Healthline. New types of blood tests, he noted, are giving many people new hope that early detection of these cancers will lead to even better survival numbers.

The report also referenced President Joe Biden’s increased funding for cancer research as part of the administration’s reignited Cancer Moonshot initiative as a key to even higher survival numbers. Biden said this month that his goal is to cut cancer death rates in the United States by at least half in the next 25 years. “Cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together,” said Biden told CNN. The administration’s new report urges Congress to fully fund and support Biden’s goal to “end cancer as we know it.”

More can be done Dr. Gwen Nichols, the medical director of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, has spent her career trying to advance cures for cancer. She is pleased with the progress noted in the AACR report. However, there are two other important areas that she believes still need more attention: access and affordability. “If we never developed another new therapy or had any new assays, we could still make major improvements today just by making certain more people got the right therapy and could afford their treatment,” Nichols told Healthline. “New cancer treatments need to be available to more people. This will give more people access earlier, answer questions faster, and help cancer improvements be for all, not just for those fortunate enough to be connected to major cancer centers,” she added. Nichols said there also needs to be more trust in the clinical trial process and a broader group of participants. She also noted that understanding the biology of aging, the molecular predispositions, and the immunologic changes associated with aging can help us better understand and predict who is at risk. “If we understand the biology of the risk, we can then move backward to prevent the biologic changes that create that risk,” she explained.",0

438,"Replacing table salt with a reduced-sodium, added-potassium 'salt substitute' is cost-saving and prevents death and disease in people at high risk of having a stroke, according to new research.

Salt substitution has been shown to reduce stroke risk by 14 percent and the number of strokes and heart attacks combined by 13 percent, but this new analysis revealed that the costs saved as a result outweighed the cost of the intervention.

The results will be presented at the American Congress of Cardiology in Washington DC on April 3 by Professor Bruce Neal, Executive Director of The George Institute Australia, and published in Circulation.

Senior author Thomas Lung, Senior Research Fellow at The George Institute for Global Health said salt substitutes should now be considered as a key element of any salt reduction campaigns.

""Our research has already shown that salt substitutes reduce the risks of stroke, heart attack and premature death, but now we can say for the first time that they also reduce healthcare costs,"" he said.

""Salt substitution is a particularly low cost and effective intervention in countries where most of sodium in the diet comes from the salt added during home cooking, which can be easily substituted.""

Globally, excess salt consumption (more than five grams per day) is responsible for three million deaths each year. Four out of five of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and nearly half are among people younger than 70.

First published in August 2021, the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study demonstrated a reduced risk of stroke, heart attack and premature death among people living in rural China.

Researchers enrolled 21,000 adults with either a history of stroke or poorly controlled blood pressure from 600 villages in rural areas of five provinces -- Hebei, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shanxi and Shaanxi between April 2014 and January 2015.

Participants in intervention villages were provided enough salt substitute to cover all household cooking and food preservation requirements -- about 20g per person per day -- free-of-charge. Those in the other villages continued using regular salt.

During an average follow up of almost five years, more than 3,000 people had a stroke. For those using the salt substitute, researchers found that stroke risk was reduced by 14 percent.

In this new analysis they weighed up the costs associated with the salt substitute intervention and compared them with the cost savings resulting from the reduced number of hospitalisations due to strokes prevented and associated quality of life benefits gained.

They found salt substitution would be cost-saving at the lowest local market price of salt substitute and cost-effective up to an estimated 1.5 times the current highest market price and 10.3 times the price of a widely available salt substitute in China.

""We've shown that the use of salt substitute by patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease is a practical and cost-effective way of reducing cardiovascular risk,"" said study author Dr Maoyi Tian, Honorary Senior Fellow at The George Institute China.

""The extent to which a patient will benefit depends on how much of their dietary salt is replaced with salt substitute, and the cost-effectiveness will depend mainly on the price of the salt substitute,"" he added.

""Salt substitution is now the only salt reduction intervention with what we would call 'grade one evidence' demonstrating cost-saving protection against cardiovascular disease and should now be considered by all countries planning or implementing sodium reduction campaigns.""",0

445,"Dec. 2, 2022 – It's difficult to keep surfaces clean in public spaces, and so much of what we touch is covered in bacteria and other microbes that can make us sick. Handwashing is the best defense against the spread of illness, but what if the surfaces we are touching in public could be protected with a spray that eliminates illness-causing microorganisms? This is exactly what a team of immunologists and engineering and material scientists at the University of Michigan have developed. A new patent is in the works, based on the technology from their research, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Naval Research. Current ways to keep surfaces germ-free aren't thorough or long-lasting, especially in places that see a lot of foot traffic, like workplaces, schools, airports, and hospitals. Copper and zinc, for example, can take a long time to kill bacteria and cannot be used for all surfaces. Disinfectant cleaners kill microbes much more quickly – in a few minutes or less – but evaporate and leave the surface vulnerable to collecting new bacteria.

The experimental coating developed by the scientists is clear, so it can be sprayed or brushed onto any surface. It's also safe for people to touch since its antimicrobial ingredients come from tea tree and cinnamon oils, both used since ancient times to destroy germs. Another key ingredient, polyurethane, is a synthetic compound that ensures the coating stays tough and durable in high-use conditions. In testing, the coating not only destroyed SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – but it also killed E. coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and other troublesome pathogens that cause substantial illness worldwide. Despite evidence supporting the safety of the ingredients, the scientists did toxicity testing that confirmed the coating's safety and published their findings in the journal Matter. After the antimicrobial was subjected to repeated cleaning and other heavy use for months, it knocked out 99.9% of microbes when used on keyboards, cellphone screens, and even kitchen cutting boards that had been covered in raw chicken.

One application can last at least 6 months before a fresh coat is needed to ensure it remains effective. Though the current formula worked on the pathogens the team tested, the specific method used to create the coating allows scientists to switch out ingredients in the coating to target specific microbes. The technology has been licensed to Hygratek, a company founded by one of the scientists on the team. While this new option will not eliminate the importance of good hand hygiene, it certainly could reduce the likelihood of getting sick after touching treated surfaces.",0

456,"Nov. 11, 2022 – Artificial intelligence holds a lot of potential in medicine, helping doctors find skin cancer, flagging potential issues on a chest X-ray, and assisting in many other procedures. Screening for colorectal cancer during a colonoscopy is another prime example. A colonoscopy -- recommended for Americans at average cancer risk starting at age 45 -- won’t be much different for patients with the addition of artificial intelligence, or AI. But behind the scenes, AI could be making detection of any precancerous polyps or cancerous lesions more likely. “AI-enhanced colonoscopy effectively turbocharges the physician's ability to find even the most subtle precancerous polyps,” says Tyler M. Berzin, MD, a gastroenterologist at the Center for Advanced Endoscopy at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The technology is designed to flag anything the computer “sees” as suspicious, but it does not replace the training and expertise of a gastroenterologist. Even with AI, doctors remain at the patient’s side and perform the procedure. The doctor remains in full control, says Prateek Sharma, MD, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at University of Kansas School of Medicine in Kansas City, KS. “AI is assisting and alerting them to colon polyps -- the precancerous lesions in the colon -- so that the doctor can remove them.” Size, height, and numbers matter with polyps. Doctors generally remove or biopsy lesions 10 millimeters and larger. But there remains less consensus about the best approach to smaller polyps. “The clinical relevance of detecting and removing small (5 to 9 mm) or diminutive (less than 5 mm) adenomas is a subject of ongoing debate,” Berzin and co-authors wrote in a leading gastroenterology journal in May 2020. One of the potential disadvantages to using AI polyp tools, for example, is “the risk of removing a higher number of diminutive or hyperplastic polyps, which increases cost and risk, without any benefit to the patient,” Berzin says. “Trained gastroenterologists are experts at identifying and removing precancerous colon polyps,” Berzin says. “But a gastroenterologist working with an AI polyp detection tool has a big advantage because AI computer vision tools can simultaneously analyze every pixel of the endoscopy monitor and can do so without being distracted or fatigued for even a millisecond.”

The benefit for patients is “another pair of eyes looking for polyps and helping the doctor,” says Sharma, who is also chair of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force at the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. AI is based on computer instructions called algorithms that learn the difference between worrisome and benign colonoscopy images and videos. AI gets better over item in a process called machine learning. When an AI system spots a potential area of concern, the technology calls attention to it by framing it within a box on the screen. Some systems also sound an audible alarm. “We are seeing more interest in using these algorithms since they will standardize endoscopists' polyp detection and, therefore, reduce the number of colon cancers missed,” says Sravanthi Parasa, MD, a gastroenterologist at the Swedish Health Services in Seattle. “These products are slowly gaining traction. During colonoscopy scheduling, patients should ask if their endoscopist has access to augmented diagnostic tools,” she says. The technology is not accurate 100% of the time – there can be false positives where the system flags a bubble in the colon, for example, as potentially dangerous. That’s just one reason that doctors still have the final say on whether a polyp is suspicious or not. AI or no AI, “colonoscopy has long been our most effective tool for preventing colon cancer, detecting precancerous polyps earlier than any other screening method,” says Berzin, who is also an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. AI and machine learning already play a role in “smart” technologies (smartphones, smartwatches, and smart speakers), self-driving cars, and speech recognition software. But the use of AI in medicine is comparatively new. And like a lot of novel technologies, it’s also expensive. “The AI equipment needs to be purchased and is expensive,” Sharma says. “The cost of the algorithms currently can be prohibitive for some centers in the current health care landscape,” Parasa agrees. “The cost is likely to come down as more algorithms enter the GI market, as it is with other software solutions.”

Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Americans. It is also the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, the CDC reports. More than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 will die in 2022, according to National Cancer Institute figures. More research is needed to examine how humans and this technology interact, Berzin says. “The most interesting research in this space will not be about comparing ‘physician versus AI,’ but will be focused on understanding the nuances of ‘physician plus AI.’” In the U.S., there are at least three FDA-approved AI algorithms for polyp detection, and more are being developed, Parasa says. “In addition, other applications which are currently available on the European market might be available in the U.S. market in the near future, including polyp characterization.” “As the field matures, we will likely see more AI augmentation tools that will assist us in detecting and diagnosing GI conditions in real time,” she adds. “A suite of algorithms like this will definitely improve patient care and outcomes.” Even though AI is somewhat of a work in progress in medicine, Berzin expects the combination of doctor and AI technology “will translate into the highest possible protection from colon cancer in the long term.”",0

• A new study finds that you may get slightly more protein from meat than from plant-based alternatives
• While 33 percent more animal protein was absorbed after 2 hours, the difference was only 2 percent by 4 hours.
• Experts say plant-based eating can provide many health benefits. New research finds that the protein in meat alternatives made from wheat and soy may not be digested as well as protein from chicken breast. “We were not surprised,” Osvaldo H. Campanella, Professor, Carl E. Haas Endowed Chair in Food Industries, Department of Food Science and Technology at Ohio State University, told Healthline. “In fact, we were expecting that the amino acid profiles would be different after the digestion of chicken meat and plant-based meat if we consider the different protein make up of these two sources,” he continued. The study was published recently in the American Chemical Society’s (ACS) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

Plant-based meat substitutes are often made with plants containing high amounts of protein, which are dehydrated into a powder and mixed with seasoning. This mix is then heated, moistened and extruded into its final form. For this study, researchers created a model meat alternative made of soy and wheat gluten using the extrusion process. Cooked pieces of plant-based alternative and chicken meat were ground up and broken down with an enzyme that humans use to digest food using “in vitro” (artificial environment such as a petri dish) tests.

Nutrients not absorbed as well by human cells For the experiment, Campanella and the team grew a layer of the human cell line that mimics the lining of the human intestine in a dish that was divided into two chambers. Then they used enzymes from the stomach and small intestine to digest the meat alternative and cooked chicken breast before placing each digested food in the chamber of the dish containing the cell layer. In order to reach the second chamber of the dish, the digested food would need to first pass through the cell layer. Next, they measured the amount of peptides that passed through the layer of gut cells and into the second chamber. This helped them estimate how much protein may be absorbed in the gut. “Peptides found in our diet can be naturally available in the food we eat or come from larger proteins that are broken down into peptides and amino acids by the digestive enzymes in the body,” explained Rebecca Tran, MS, RDN, Clinical Dietitian, Torrance Memorial Medical Center. She added that peptides have many essential biological functions such as anti-inflammation, anti-hypertensive, anti-microbial, and antioxidant properties.

Overall the difference was slight The team looked at the results after 1, 2 and 4 hours, which is the amount of time is generally the longest it takes for food to move through the small intestine. They found at 2 hours about 8 percent of peptides of the chicken breast protein had moved through the gut cells compared to about 6 percent for the plant-based alternative. This means about 33% more protein moved through the gut cells. At 4 hours it was about 23 percent to about 21 percent respectively. “Our in vitro tests have shown that the profile of essential amino acids of meat analogs after digestion and absorption is slightly inferior than those from chicken,” said Campanella. “But still, the profile is suitable and can complement a balanced and healthy human diet,” he confirmed.

“In our work, we used a basic formulation including soybean and wheat proteins,” said Campanella. “However, proteins can be sourced from other legumes.” He said these include navy beans, kidney beans, lima beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas, and cereal proteins, among others, “that supply a variety of demonstrated nutritional benefits.” According to Campanella, his team is working on these potential alternatives to find optimized formulations and processing conditions. Their goal is “to achieve products with desirable organoleptic, nutritional properties as well as competitive price,” he said.

Tran said that although some plant-based meat alternatives can be highly processed and high in sodium and saturated fat, obtaining protein from whole, nutrient-dense plant foods such as legumes, nuts, vegetables, seeds, and grains has many long-term health benefits. “First, plant proteins are very high in fiber compared to many animal-based proteins,” she said. “The high fiber content can help with lowering cholesterol, reducing blood sugar, and reducing overall hunger.” She added that whole-plant proteins often contain less saturated fat and cholesterol than many animal proteins, which can lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

How healthy are currently available plant-based meat alternatives? According to Tran, while plant-based meat alternatives have become an increasingly popular health and environmental trend, there are many misconceptions about the nutritional value of these “meatless meats.” “In fact, a majority of these plant-based meat alternatives brands have drawn in customers by advertising their products as tasting nearly identical to animal-based proteins,” she said. “While also being high in protein and low in saturated fat and cholesterol.” However, she explained that for these meat alternatives to taste similar to animal products, “binders” are often used to hold plant proteins together and mimic the texture of meat. These include xanthan gum, carrageenan, methylcellulose, food isolates, and extracts that are added to the product. Tran cautioned that these additives make the food much less healthful than other meat alternatives that are made with whole plant-based foods such as beans, rice, mushrooms, and vegetables. “Also, many of these processed meat alternatives can be high in sodium, and some are made with oils such as coconut oil or palm oil, which are high in saturated fat,” she said. Tran emphasized the importance of reading food labels of these products to decide if the plant-based meat is a healthful choice or should be consumed in moderation.",0

459,"Improvements in pain, physical function and work productivity largely endure for at least seven years after bariatric surgery, despite some backsliding from the high levels of improvement seen in the years immediately following surgery, University of Pittsburgh epidemiologists report today in JAMA Network Open.

The findings -- which show that improvements persist even with participants aging over the course of the study -- can help inform physicians, health insurance providers and patients, many of whom undergo surgery to alleviate joint pain and improve mobility.

""Adults with severe obesity are much more likely to experience significant joint pain and limits to their physical abilities,"" said Wendy C. King, Ph.D., associate professor of epidemiology in Pitt's School of Public Health. ""Obesity leads to an earlier need for knee and hip replacement. However, adults with severe obesity may be denied joint surgery until they lose weight. And, if physical limitations and pain interfere with job performance, losing weight could be necessary to maintain employment.""

For seven years, King and her colleagues followed 1,491 adults who, between 2006 and 2009, received either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, the two most common and effective surgical treatments for severe obesity. At the time of surgery, the study participants were a median age of 47 years, and 80% were female.

The participants were enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-funded Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2), a prospective, cohort study of U.S. patients undergoing weight-loss surgery.

The new research builds on a previous study by King and her colleagues finding that, in the three years following bariatric surgery, 50% to 70% of study participants reported clinically important improvements in pain levels, physical function and usual walking speed.

""At the time, that research provided the largest and longest-running evaluation of changes in pain and physical function after modern-day bariatric procedures,"" King said. ""Our new study more than doubles that timespan, giving patients and doctors a better understanding of the likelihood that bariatric surgery will yield lasting results.""

In their updated analysis, the researchers found that at seven years post-surgery, 43% of participants had clinically important improvements in pain, 64% in physical function and 50% in 400-meter walk time, all down between 7 to 11 percentage points from the three-year assessment.

Among participants with symptoms indicative of osteoarthrosis before receiving bariatric surgery, at seven years post-surgery, 65% reported improvements in hip pain, while 72% reported improvements in knee function, both down from 77% at three years post-surgery.

The small to moderate declines in pain and physical function improvements are not surprising, considering the participants also aged over the course of the study to a median of 54 years, King said. Previous research shows that some aspects of physical function, such as balance and strength, start to decline when people enter their 50s, and others, such as walking speed and aerobic endurance, typically decline in the sixth decade of life.

""On average, participants experienced durable improvements in walking speed, fitness and almost all metrics of pain,"" King said.

In addition, participants reported that pain and health status interfered less with their ability to work post-surgery, with 43% of participants reporting impaired work due to health seven years post-surgery, down from 63% pre-surgery.

""Combined, our study provides great news about the lasting effects of bariatric surgery,"" King said. ""But clinicians should look at patients as individuals and consider their complete health history, goals and motivations for weight loss when providing presurgical counseling on potential results.""

Additional authors of this research are Amanda S. Hinerman, Ph.D., and Gretchen E. White, Ph.D., both of Pitt.

462,"It's well known that obesity is linked to the development of numerous diseases in humans. Heart disease, diabetes, and other ailments are extremely common in obese individuals. However, it's not fully clear how body organs specifically deteriorate and lose functionality from chronic obesity. In a recent article published in Nature, a group of researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) used mouse model experiments to examine how a high-fat diet or genetically induced obesity can affect hair thinning and loss. The authors found that obesity can lead to depletion of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) through the induction of certain inflammatory signals, blocking hair follicle regeneration and ultimately resulting in loss of hair follicles.

Normally, HFSCs self-renew every hair follicle cycle. This is part of the process that allows our hair to continuously grow back. As humans age, HFSCs fail to replenish themselves leading to fewer HFSCs and therefore hair thinning. Although overweight people has higher risk of androgenic alopecia, whether obesity accelerates hair thinning, how and the molecular mechanisms have been largely unknown. The TMDU group aimed to address those qeustions and identified some of the mechanisms.

""High-fat diet feeding accelerates hair thinning by depleting HFSCs that replenish mature cells that grow hair, especially in old mice. "" says lead author of the study Hironobu Morinaga. ""We compared the gene expression in HFSCs between HFD-fed mice and standard diet-fed mice and traced the fate of those HFSCs after their activation. ""We found that those HFSCs in HFD-fed obesed mice change their fate into the skin surface corneocytes or sebocytes that secrete sebum upon their activation. Those mice show faster hair loss and smaller hair follicles along with depletion of HFSCs.""

""Even with HFD feeding in four consecutive days, HFSCs shows increased oxidative stress and the signs of epidermal differentiation.""

""The gene expression in HFSCs from the high-fat-fed mice indicated the activation of inflammatory cytokine signaling within HFSCs"" describes Emi K. Nishimura, senior author. ""The inflammatory signals in HFSCs strikingly repress Sonic hedgehog signaling that plays crucial role in hair follicle regeneration in HFSCs.

The researchers confirmed the activation of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in this process can rescue the depletion of HFSCs. ""This could prevent the hair loss brought on by the high-fat diet. ""said Nishimura.

This study provides interesting new insights into the specific cellular fate changes and tissue dysfunction that can occur following a high-fat diet or genetically induced obesity and may open the door for future prevention and treatment of hair thinning as well as for understanding of obesity-related diseases.",0
465,"To date, there have been few recommendations to guide physicians about when to offer men genetic consultation for prostate cancer risk. Now, an international and inter-specialty panel of experts convened at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at Thomas Jefferson University have developed a comprehensive set of recommendations. This consensus statement, published December 13th in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, will help physicians and stakeholders make sense of a rapidly evolving field of practice.

""There is increasing recognition that some prostate cancers can be inherited. Genetic testing could provide men and their families with information about cancer risk, inform screening, and guide better treatment planning and options,"" said lead author Veda N. Giri, MD, Director of Cancer Risk Assessment and Clinical Cancer Genetics in the Department of Medical Oncology and member of the Prostate Cancer Program at the SKCC.

Research has shown that a subset of prostate cancers, about 10-15 percent of all prostate cancer, are inherited and that at least some of the genes that confer the inherited risk are known and testable. However, clinical practice including referrals, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and genetically-informed management needs to encompass research advances and increasingly available commercial genetic tests. The goal of the consensus statement was to provide a comprehensive and balanced clinical approach to genetic referrals and testing relevant to clinical cancer genetics specialists, genetic counselors, urologists, oncologists, and primary care providers to provide men with an opportunity to make an informed decision regarding genetic testing, screening, and personalized treatment.

""With a multitude of genetic tests on the market already, the technology provides more information right now, than we can act upon in the clinic,"" said senior author Leonard Gomella, MD, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson and Clinical Director of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Network. ""We convened a consensus panel at Jefferson to fill the gap in guidelines and develop best practices for when and how to use these genetic panels, and how to help patients navigate the information they receive from them.""

While genomic testing of prostate cancer is performed to help optimize and personalize treatment, genetic testing reveals information that can impact entire families, older and younger generations alike. ""A genetic test can reveal mutations that could impact a son, daughter, sister, brother or other relatives and reveal higher risks of cancer across a family, which is why men need to understand the implications of genetic testing. A key factor in making an informed decision is receiving appropriate genetic counseling prior to genetic testing,"" said Dr. Giri. ""An important evolving area is precision medicine where tumor sequencing to identify targetable mutations for treatment may also provide a clue to inherited prostate cancer, again raising the question of how best to provide genetic counseling in this setting,"" added Dr. Giri.

""In order to build informed and thoughtful guidelines, we invited over 70 experts not only from the fields including urology, genetics, and medical oncology, but also from fields unrelated to prostate cancer, but with long track records and experience with genetic testing and counseling,"" said prostate cancer researcher Karen Knudsen, PhD, Director of the SKCC, and Co-Chair with Drs. Giri and Gomella, of the Consensus Panel. For example gynecological oncology and breast cancer experts were in attendance as well as patient advocates and experts in bioethics and health disparities who allowed the group to keep the patient experience top of mind. ""Being only one of eight formal prostate cancer programs of excellence within NCI-designated cancer centers, the SKCC was an ideal location for this summit,"" said Dr. Knudsen.
• Urologists, who are typically the first to diagnose a man with prostate cancer, should perform a more thorough family history intake that includes cancers on the mother's as well as father's side in order to assess whether a man should be referred for genetic counseling and testing. Physicians should consider prostate, breast, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancers, and melanoma for intake of family history to determine inherited prostate cancer risk. ""Without this first step of thorough screening, it's difficult to capture men who should be referred for genetic counseling and testing, who may need to be monitored more closely, and perhaps need to start prostate cancer screenings earlier than the general guidelines suggest as a preventative measure. Furthermore, some men may need to be considered for more aggressive treatment earlier on,"" said Dr. Gomella.
• Systems to streamline referrals to genetic counselors are needed so they can educate men and their families about genetic risks for cancer, and help suggest genetic testing for family members who may also be at increased risk.
• While current commercially available genetic tests specifically for inherited prostate cancer risk can cover anywhere from 10-14 genes (and even larger cancer gene panels are available), clinical actionability for prostate cancer screening and management are relevant for a subset of these genes. For example, men with prostate cancer with inherited mutations in the BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM genes may respond to PARP inhibitors, especially if prostate cancer has progressed to metastasis and is resistant to initial treatments. Therefore, the consensus panel agreed with other national organizations that men with metastatic prostate cancer should be considered for genetic counseling and genetic testing to determine if their prostate cancer was inherited. The consensus statement also expanded considerations of prostate cancer screening and management of early-stage disease based on genetic test results, which is a gap in current guidelines.
• Areas in critical need of further research identified by the consensus panel include genetic testing in African American males, greater understanding of the genetic basis for aggressive prostate cancer, and health economic impact of genetic testing for prostate cancer.",0

474,"A new test for offers the possibility of near real time monitoring of bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and multiple myeloma. The functionality of the test, which measures changes in calcium isotope ratios, has been validated on blood samples from NASA space shuttle astronauts.

Our bones are largely built of calcium, and the turnover of calcium can indicate the development of bone diseases such as osteoporosis and the cancer multiple myeloma. Geochemists have developed extremely accurate ways of measuring calcium isotope ratios, for example for the study of sea shell deposits in sedimentary rocks. Now a group of US geochemists, biologists and clinicians, from Arizona State University and the Mayo Clinic, have worked with NASA to put these techniques together to develop a new, rapid test of bone health.

These methods, using mass spectrometry, can discern the relative ratios of the calcium isotopes 42Ca and 44Ca in bone. The researchers found that lighter calcium isotopes, such as 42Ca, are absorbed from the blood into the bone during bone formation. Conversely, these light isotopes tend to be released into the bloodstream when bones break down. By measuring the ratios of the two isotopes in blood or urine scientists can calculate the rate of change of bone mass

According to lead researcher, Ariel Anbar(Arizona State University): ""The big advantage of these measurements is that they show what is happening in the bone, whereas traditional bone health measurements, such as DXA scans, show what has happened. This means that we can have a real near-time view of what is happening in the bone, rather than comparing before and after, when damage may have already been done.""

""Our goal is that these measurements will allow us to see bone breakdown in osteoporosis, but also can show us the progress of certain bone cancers, such as multiple myeloma.""

The research was piloted in bed-bound subjects (who lose bone mass), but the best way for the researchers to test whether the system worked was in an ambient and less controlled population who are known to experience rapid bone loss. In space, because of zero gravity conditions, astronauts experience very rapid bone loss. Working with NASA, the researchers measured calcium isotope ratios in urine from 30 shuttle astronauts, before, during, and after the flights. This allowed them to confirm that the test worked at high sensitivity (NASA partly funded the research).

Ariel Anbar said: ""We were able to confirm that Ca isotopes of the shuttle shifted as expected, meaning that they we could see in more or less real time the ongoing bone loss. We did this using a simple urine sample, taken at various points during their flights.""

The researchers have also looked at a group of 71 patients who either had multiple myeloma (bone cancer), or were at risk of multiple myeloma.

""What we saw with cancer patients was interesting. Those patients who tended to lose the lighter 42Ca isotope seemed to be the ones where the cancer was the most active. This means that the tests could theoretically feed into decisions on whether or not to treat a patient, for example if a cancer was dormant or growing very slowly, and to assess the effectiveness of treatments.""

He continued ""At the moment, this is still a test which is in development, but we have shown it can work. There is work to be done to further validate the tests, and costs to consider, however the advantage for this methodology is that the patient doesn't have to come to the machine; the measurements can be done with a blood or urine test.

SIGA, a drug company, will deliver the product in 2023. The IV version is an “important option” for patients who can’t swallow the pill, the company said, particularly since monkeypox can cause rashes and blisters in the mouth.

The contract, as well as the funding of a study of IV TPOXX, “highlight the growing importance of a broad-based response to the substantial risks posed by the orthopox family of viruses, including smallpox and monkeypox,” Phil Gomez, PhD, the CEO of SIGA, said in the statement.

“We will continue to coordinate with the U.S. government toward future procurements of oral TPOXX and IV TPOXX,” he said.

The oral and IV versions of TPOXX are approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox, though they aren’t yet approved for monkeypox, according to Reuters. But the CDC has provided guidance for use under “expanded access” as an experimental drug.",0

488,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — People who stop breathing during sleep may have higher accumulations of the toxic protein tau, a biological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease in part of the brain that manages memory, navigation and perception of time. A preliminary Mayo Clinic study released Sunday, March 3, will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 71st Annual Meeting in Philadelphia May 4–10.

Recent evidence has supported an association between an increased risk for dementia and sleep disruption. That's particularly true for obstructive sleep apnea, which is a potentially serious disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during sleep. However, it remains unclear what could be driving this association.

Using the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, researchers identified 288 people 65 and older who did not have dementia. Their bed partners were asked whether they noticed if their partners stopped breathing during sleep. Positron emission tomography brain scans of study participants looked for buildup of the toxic protein tau in the entorhinal cortex, which is the part of the brain that is deep behind the nose and susceptible to accumulating tau. The entorhinal cortex stores and retrieves information related to visual perception and when experiences happen. The dysfunctional tau protein forms tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, contributing to cognitive decline.

Fifteen percent of the study group, or 43 participants, had bed partners who witnessed sleep apnea. Participants with witnessed apneas had about 4.5 percent higher levels of tau in the entorhinal cortex than those who have not been observed to have apneas during sleep. To reduce the effect of confounding variables, researchers controlled for several other factors that affect tau levels in the brain, such as age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors and other sleep complaints.

“Our research results raise the possibility that sleep apnea affects tau accumulation,” says Diego Z. Carvalho, M.D., first author and neurology fellow at Mayo Clinic.

“But it's a chicken and egg problem,” he notes, pointing to questions of which comes first as an underlying cause. Does sleep apnea cause an accumulation of tau, a toxic protein that forms into tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease? Or does the accumulation of tau in certain areas cause sleep apnea? “Longer studies are now needed to solve this problem.”

Study limitations included a lack of sleep studies to confirm sleep apnea and its severity, and a lack of information about participants' sleep apnea treatment.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

497,"Patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) prescribed full-dose blood thinners are significantly more likely to experience heavy bleeding than patients prescribed a smaller yet equally effective dose, according to a recent University at Buffalo-led study.

The research, which compared the safety and effectiveness of blood clot treatment strategies for more than 150 critically ill COVID-19 patients at two hospitals, found that almost all patients who experienced significant bleeding were mechanically ventilated and receiving full-dose anticoagulants (blood thinners).

The results, published last month in Hospital Pharmacy, may inform treatment guidelines for blood clots in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who are at an increased risk for both blood clots and severe bleeding. Previous reports have found that 17% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experience blood clots, says first author Maya Chilbert, PharmD, clinical assistant professor in the UB School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

""A wide variety of practice exists when it comes to approaching blood clots in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and there is little data to suggest improved outcomes using one strategy versus another,"" says Chilbert. ""Caution should be used in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 when selecting a regimen to treat blood clots, and the decision to use full-dose blood thinners should be based on a compelling indication rather than lab markers alone.""

Additional investigators in the UB School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences include Collin Clark, PharmD, clinical assistant professor, and Ashley Woodruff, PharmD, clinical associate professor. The research was also conducted by investigators at the Buffalo General Medical Center, Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital and Erie County Medical Center.

The study analyzed the outcome of blood clot treatments and the rate of bleeding events for more than 150 patients with COVID-19 who received either of two blood thinner regimens: a full-dose based on patient levels of D-dimer (a protein present in the blood after a blood clot dissolves), and the other a smaller but higher-than-standard dosage.

The average patient age was 58, and all experienced elevated levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen (a protein that helps the body form blood clots), and prothrombin time (a test that measures the time it takes for blood plasma to clot).

Nearly 14% of patients who received full-dose blood thinners experienced a significant bleeding event, compared to only 3% of patients who received a higher-than-standard dosage. All patients who experienced bleeding events were mechanically ventilated. No difference was reported in the regimens' effectiveness at treating blood clots.

Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal strategy for treating blood clots and bleeding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, says Chilbert.",0

503,"Akron: Cleveland Clinic Akron General begins its first Centering Pregnancy™ group today. This national program has been shown to dramatically improve maternal outcomes, such as reducing low birth weight and prematurity.

In the program, a group of about 10 pregnant women with roughly the same due date meet together as a “circle” with a trained facilitator for 8 to 10 sessions to learn about many aspects of pregnancy, labor and delivery, and infant care.

“The women who participate in Centering Pregnancy learn so much, and you can really tell at delivery who has been through the program, as they are more relaxed and know what questions to ask,” said Holly Carder, an experienced Centering Pregnancy facilitator who recently joined Akron General to coordinate its program. “They also form a real sisterhood of support with the others in their circle. They often watch each other’s children and spend time together afterward.”

Typically, Centering Pregnancy participants are seen by a healthcare provider for their regular prenatal checkup, including blood pressure and weight checks, at the sessions, then spend up to two hours in their circle. This results in women spending about 10 times more time with a provider than with traditional prenatal care. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the circles are being held via virtual group calls for the foreseeable future.

Carder said virtual sessions are still highly effective educationally and can even increase the program’s already high attendance numbers because issues such as transportation or child care are not barriers for the women. “They can participate while relaxing at home,” she said.

As long as the program occurs in a virtual format, blood pressure cuffs and hand-held fetal Doppler devices will be provided to the participants so they can monitor their vital signs on their own but they will also come in to the clinic for prenatal visits.

The circles will be facilitated by Carder and three Akron General OB/GYNs ‒ Natalie Bowersox, M.D.; Jennifer Savitski, M.D.; and Maura O’Shea, M.D.

Centering Pregnancy is one of the core programs that Akron General is utilizing to increase access to healthcare for those affected by health disparities in Summit County. Other programs being supported by Akron General’s Neighbor to Neighbor initiative include a COVID-19 testing site in downtown Akron, community health programs such as the Minority Men’s Health Fair, education of the next generation of family physicians and expanded wrap-around support for patients, such as follow-up calls from social workers and nurses in Akron General’s Center for Family Medicine. Also, Akron General offers nutrition programming for Centering Pregnancy through a grant from the Women’s Endowment Fund of Akron Community Foundation.

Akron General’s Centering Pregnancy program is being launched thanks in part to a $1 million grant through Summit County after a legal settlement from Johnson & Johnson to reduce the devastation of the opioid epidemic. Akron General partners with the AxessPointe Women’s Health Center on the program.

Women who seek prenatal care at AxessPointe, a federally qualified health center that served more than 21,000 patients in 2019 in Summit and Portage counties, are offered information about Centering Pregnancy at their first visit. They are also given an opportunity to connect with a community health worker who can help them access other resources to help reduce barriers to having a healthy baby, such as housing or food assistance.

“AxessPointe is pleased to partner with Akron General to provide the Centering Pregnancy program as an additional resource for our patients as we strive to improve pregnancy outcomes and reduce infant mortality,” said E. Demond Scott, M.D., MPH, chief medical officer at AxessPointe Community Health Centers.",0

509,"A research model of dietary intake in 184 countries, developed by researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, estimates that poor diet contributed to over 14.1 million cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, representing over 70% of new diagnoses globally. The analysis, which looked at data from 1990 and 2018, provides valuable insight into which dietary factors are driving type 2 diabetes burden by world region. The study was published April 17 in the journal Nature Medicine.

Of the 11 dietary factors considered, three had an outsized contribution to the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes: Insufficient intake of whole grains, excesses of refined rice and wheat, and the overconsumption of processed meat. Factors such as drinking too much fruit juice and not eating enough non-starchy vegetables, nuts, or seeds, had less of an impact on new cases of the disease.

""Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally, and with important variation by nation and over time,"" says senior author Dariush Mozaffarian, Jean Mayer Professor of Nutrition and dean for policy at the Friedman School. ""These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes.""

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the resistance of the body's cells to insulin. Of the 184 countries included in the Nature Medicine study, all saw an increase in type 2 diabetes cases between 1990 and 2018, representing a growing burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems.

The research team based their model on information from the Global Dietary Database, along with population demographics from multiple sources, global type 2 diabetes incidence estimates, and data on how food choices impact people living with obesity and type 2 diabetes from multiple published papers.

The analysis revealed that poor diet is causing a larger proportion of total type 2 diabetes incidence in men versus women, in younger versus older adults, and in urban versus rural residents at the global level.

Regionally, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia -- particularly in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to be rich in red meat, processed meat, and potatoes -- had the greatest number of type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Incidence was also high in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially in Colombia and Mexico, which was credited to high consumption of sugary drinks, processed meat, and low intake of whole grains.

Regions where diet had less of an impact on type 2 diabetes cases included South Asia and Sub-Sharan Africa -- though the largest increases in type 2 diabetes due to poor diet between 1990 and 2018 were observed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 30 most populated countries studied, India, Nigeria, and Ethiopia had the fewest case of type 2 diabetes related to unhealthy eating.

""Left unchecked and with incidence only projected to rise, type 2 diabetes will continue to impact population health, economic productivity, health care system capacity, and drive heath inequities worldwide,"" says first author Meghan O'Hearn. She conducted this research while a PhD candidate at the Friedman School and currently works as Impact Director for Food Systems for the Future, a non-profit institute and for-profit fund that enables innovative food and agriculture enterprises to measurably improve nutrition outcomes for underserved and low-income communities. ""These findings can help inform nutritional priorities for clinicians, policymakers, and private sector actors as they encourage healthier dietary choices that address this global epidemic.""

Other recent studies have estimated that 40% of type 2 diabetes cases globally are attributed to suboptimal diet, lower than the 70% reported in the Nature Medicine paper. The research team attributes this to the new information in their analysis, such as the first ever inclusion of refined grains, which was one of the top contributors to diabetes burdens; and updated data on dietary habits based on national individual-level dietary surveys, rather than agricultural estimates. The investigators also note that they presented the uncertainty of these new estimates, which can continue to be refined as new data emerges.",0
511,"June 22, 2022 – The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from pharmaceutical company Bayer to dismiss thousands of lawsuits that claim the company’s Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.

Hardeman’s lawsuit has served as a test case for thousands of similar lawsuits, according to The Associated Press. The Supreme Court’s decision dealt a blow to Bayer as the German company seeks to avoid potentially billions of dollars in damages in those cases.

513,"Rates of anxiety and depression have been increasing around the world for decades, a trend that has been sharply exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. New research led by the Boyce Thompson Institute's Frank Schroeder could ultimately lead to new therapeutics to help relieve this global mental health burden.

First discovered in the 1930s, serotonin is a neurotransmitter produced in many animals that mediates myriad behaviors, such as feeding, sleep, mood and cognition. Drugs that alter serotonin levels are the main weapon to treat psychological conditions like anxiety and depression, as well as eating disorders.

As a simple model for neurobiology research, the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has been used extensively to study serotonin's role in regulating behavior and food intake. For many years, researchers thought that serotonin was made in C. elegans by one specific molecular pathway, and that serotonin was then quickly degraded. Schroeder's team and colleagues at Columbia University now demonstrated that both of those assumptions were not quite correct.

""We discovered a second, parallel biosynthetic pathway that accounts for about half of the total serotonin produced in our model system,"" said Schroeder.

The findings are described in a paper published in Nature Chemical Biology on October 10.

The work began about three years ago, when the researchers unexpectedly discovered an enzyme that converts serotonin into derivative compounds.

""Most people in the field thought serotonin is made and then quickly broken down, but we found that, instead, it is used as a building block for other compounds that are responsible for some of serotonin's activity,"" explained Schroeder. ""So, we decided to start at the beginning and see how serotonin is made, and once it is made then how is it converted into these new molecules.""

Jingfang Yu, a graduate student in Schroeder's lab and first author on the paper, further showed that the new serotonin derivatives affect feeding behavior.

""When the worms lack endogenous serotonin, they tend to move quickly across the bacteria food lawn on an agar plate, and turn infrequently to explore the food,"" Yu said. ""We found this behavior can be alleviated by treating the worms with serotonin derivatives, suggesting these newly identified compounds contribute to effects previously attributed to serotonin.""

The worm C. elegans is an excellent model for studying serotonin because the compound's molecular signaling pathways are highly conserved across species, including in humans. For example, the researchers showed that in C. elegans a large portion of serotonin is made in the gut, which is also the case in humans.

Schroeder said there are hints that human serotonin is converted into metabolites similar to the ones identified in C. elegans.

""This research opens up the door for many more avenues of research in humans,"" said Schroeder, who is also a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology in the college of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University.

""Are the analogous metabolites important in humans? What is the role of one manufacturing pathway versus the other? How are these manufacturing pathways and metabolites important for human behaviors, like mental health and feeding behaviors?"" he asked.

The researchers are currently exploring how the new serotonin derivatives affect behavior in C. elegans and whether similar serotonin metabolites exist in humans.",0

516,"Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden recently reported that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could reduce overdiagnoses and thereby improve prostate cancer screening. Now, the same research group has published a study in The Lancet Oncology, which shows that the addition of a novel blood test, the Stockholm3 test, can reduce the number of MRIs performed by a third while further preventing the detection of minor, low-risk tumours.

""Overall, our studies show that we have identified the tools needed to be able to carry out effective and safe screening for prostate cancer. After many years of debate and research, it feels fantastic to be able to present knowledge that can improve healthcare for men,"" says Tobias Nordström, associate professor of urology at the Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital at Karolinska Institutet, who is responsible for the STHLM3MRI study.

Current screening methods -- PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests combined with traditional biopsies -- result in unnecessary biopsies and the detection of numerous minor, low-risk tumours (overdiagnosis). Consequently, no country except Lithuania has chosen to introduce a nationwide prostate cancer screening programme, as the benefits do not outweigh the disadvantages.

On July 9 2021, results from the STHLM3MRI study were presented in The New England Journal of Medicine, indicating that overdiagnosis could be reduced by substituting traditional prostate biopsies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies. The new results, now published in The Lancet Oncology, show that the addition of the Stockholm3 test, which was developed by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, can be an important complement. It is a blood test that uses an algorithm to analyse a combination of protein markers, genetic markers and clinical data.

""The availability of MRI in healthcare will be a limiting factor. We now show that a novel blood test as adjunct to MRI can reduce the number of MRIs performed by a third. Compared with traditional screening, overdiagnosis is reduced by as much as 69 percent. At the same time, the number of biopsies is halved, while we can find just as many clinically significant tumours,"" says Martin Eklund, associate professor at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, with joint responsibility for the STHLM3MRI study.

STHLM3MRI is a randomised study that was conducted between 2018 and 2021 with 12,750 male participants from Stockholm County. The participants provided an initial blood sample for PSA analysis and analysis using the new Stockholm3 test. Men with test results showing elevated PSA levels were then randomly selected for traditional biopsies or MRI. In the MRI group, biopsies were conducted strictly on suspected tumours identified by MRI.

""Separate use of the Stockholm3 test and MRI has previously been shown to be cost-effective. We have now analysed the cost-effectiveness when these tools are combined and will shortly report exciting results from that analysis,"" Tobias Nordström concludes.

The research was financed by the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, Karolinska Institutet, Hagstrandska Minnesfonden, Region Stockholm, the Swedish Order of Druids, the Åke Wiberg Foundation, the Swedish e-Science Research Center (SeRC) and Prostatacancerförbundet (the Prostate Cancer Association). Early validation was financed by EIT Health.

523,"A research study published in the journal Neoplasia and led by principal investigator Nallasivam Palanisamy, Ph.D., associate scientist in the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Health System, has identified a novel prostate cancer gene fusion involving the KLK4 protein coding gene and KLKP1 pseudogene. This unique biomarker can be detected in the urine samples of patients with prostate cancer, offering a non-invasive means of detection.

Currently, the prostate specific antigen (PSA) exam is used as the standard screening method for prostate cancer. However, elevated PSA levels are not exclusive to prostate cancer, as they can also be caused by benign prostate conditions. As a result, an elevated PSA test can sometimes lead to an unnecessary prostate biopsy for the patient, which carries a risk of bleeding and infection. Findings from this research may offer a more accurate and reliable method to diagnose prostate cancer.

""This study is exciting because it has the potential to offer a non-invasive alternative to the traditional PSA test in order to diagnose significant prostate cancers,"" said Craig Rogers, M.D., chair of the Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford Health System. ""The discovery of new biomarkers ultimately benefits our patients, as it advances our understanding of this complex disease and how to most effectively treat it.""

When the KLK4 protein coding gene and KLKP1 pseudogene fuse together, the fusion gene KLK4-KLKP1 is formed. Pseudogenes like KLKP1 are the non-functional, or dead, versions of an actual gene that is normally not expressed in a cell but can become active in cancerous cells and disrupt the functions of the actual gene.

""The unique feature of this fusion gene is the conversion of the noncoding pseudogene KLKP1 into a protein coding gene, and its unique expression in about 30 percent of high Gleason grade prostate cancer,"" said Dr. Palanisamy. ""Like other ETS family gene fusions, KLK4-KLKP1 can also be detected in the urine samples of patients with prostate cancer, enabling non-invasive detection of prostate cancer. Given the unique feature of this fusion, prostate cancer specific expression, oncogenic properties and noninvasive detection, this novel gene fusion has the potential to be used as a biomarker for early detection of prostate cancer and a therapeutic target.""

The researchers conducting this study screened a cohort of 659 patients (380 Caucasian American; 250 African American, and 29 patients of other races), which revealed that the KLK4-KLKP1 fusion gene is expressed in about 32 percent of prostate cancer patients, representing a distinct subset of prostate cancer cases. Correlative analysis showed that the new fusion gene can be used in combination with other prostate cancer molecular markers for cancer detection. In addition to urine samples, the fusion could also be detected in needle biopsy tissue samples by using a specific antibody.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. Advances in diagnosis, treatment, and management have resulted in increased survival rates, yet prostate cancer still remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among American men. One of the major barriers to achieving successful prostate cancer control is the underlying molecular complexity of the disease itself.",0

• CDC researchers found the MIS-C case rate in vaccinated U.S. children ages 12 to 20 years old was much lower than for unvaccinated people.
• The findings show that in over 21 million children and adolescents who received one or more doses of the vaccine, there was only one reported case per million of MIS-C for this age group. A new of children who had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine found that occurrences of multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were rare and far less likely than for children who developed COVID-19 and were not vaccinated. Researchers analyzed cases of MIS-C from December 2020 to August 2021 in vaccinated people ages 12 to 20 years old. They wanted to know whether the vaccine was linked to an increased risk for MIS-C. The findings show that in over 21 million children and adolescents who had received one or more vaccine doses, there was only one reported case per million of MIS-C for this age group. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers found that the MIS-C case rate in vaccinated U.S. children 12 to 20 years old was much lower than previous estimates for unvaccinated individuals in the same age group who had contracted the virus.

MIS-C has been documented in children who had COVID-19 and appeared to recover days, weeks, or even months before developing new symptoms. “It’s a rare condition associated with COVID-19 infection in which multi-organ systems within the body become inflamed – inclusive of the heart, lungs, brain, eyes,” Dr. Kecia Gaither, double board certified in OB/GYN and maternal fetal medicine, and director of perinatal services at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln in the Bronx, told Healthline. Researchers wanted to see if MIS-C was also a risk for children if they had received a COVID-19 vaccine but had not developed the disease. “We identified a small number of individuals aged 12–20 years with MIS-C after COVID-19 vaccination; most had laboratory evidence of past or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection,” study authors wrote. The reported rate of MIS-C for those in the study who had not had previous COVID-19 disease was 0.3 cases per million vaccinated individuals. A previous cited by the researchers found that the risk of MIS-C after COVID-19 was 224 per million SARS-CoV-2 infections for children ages 11 to 15. Study authors say more research is needed to determine whether vaccination was related to the development of the MIS-C illness in the rare cases they identified. The team also noted the possibility that some of those cases involved children with other undiagnosed inflammatory conditions that developed after being vaccinated. “As with COVID-19 illness, clinicians and researchers are still learning about MIS-C. Our investigation highlights the challenges in diagnosing MIS-C, the importance of considering alternative diagnoses, and the need to monitor for MIS-C illness,” study co-author Dr. Anna R. Yousaf said in a statement.

Still no way to determine who is at risk for MIS-C Currently, there is no clear relationship regarding who is at most risk for MIS-C after a COVID-19 case, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, FAAP and chief health correspondent and medical affairs officer at AltaMed Health Services. “We’ve also seen kids with neurological conditions and chronic health problems develop it, too,” Shapiro added. “It’s important to understand that COVID-19 doesn’t discriminate. Unfortunately, MIS-C can affect any child who contracts the virus.” Shapiro noted an association with children who survive COVID-19 and develop MIS-C. “Just like in the past, we have seen children develop , another inflammatory condition, after being infected with viruses,” he said. “Compared to other years, we started to see thousands of these inflammatory symptoms emerge after COVID-19,” Shapiro added. Gaither said children with MIS-C have a persistent fever with vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. More severe symptoms may include: “These symptoms are variable in presentation from child to child,” Gaither said. “And in essence represent a delayed response to COVID-19 infection,” she said.

MIS-C can occur 2 to 6 weeks after COVID-19 Dr. Jin-Young Han, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Weill Cornell Medicine, said MIS-C could occur in some children 2 to 6 weeks after acute COVID-19 disease. Asked how the condition is treated and about the child’s prognosis, Han said the “vast majority” experience complete recovery with no long-term aftereffects. “Most patients are treated with IVIG ( ) and steroids, typically methylprednisolone,” he said. Finding the reason MIS-C is associated with children who have COVID-19 is an area of intense study for many scientists and physicians, Han said. “Although there are many theories, the answer is unknown at this time,” he said.

Vaccination is the best protection Shapiro emphasized the importance of giving the body the tools to defend itself. He noted that children were kept home and not exposed to others at the start of the pandemic, shielding them from the virus. “Once children returned to in-person learning, we experienced a large uptick of COVID-19 cases, and suddenly the concept of it’s ‘just a cold’ started to dissipate,” said Shapiro. “We started to see more kids go to the hospital, the ER, and experience MIS-C, long COVID, and additional complications,” he continued. “Vaccination is the best protection for our kids to keep them safely in school where they can learn, develop friendships, and valuable social skills.”",0
526,"Nucleus RadioPharma is developing technologies to usher in a new era in radiopharmaceutical development, supply chain and manufacturing

ROCHESTER, Minn., and PALO ALTO, Calif. — Eclipse, a venture capital firm investing in the digital transformation of the world's physical industries, and Mayo Clinic today announced the creation and seed funding of Nucleus RadioPharma, a new company built to ensure cancer patients can access potentially lifesaving radiopharmaceuticals by developing technologies to modernize the clinical development, manufacturing and supply chain of these promising new therapies.

Charles S. Conroy, one of the world's top experts in radiopharmaceuticals, is heading the effort as CEO. He most recently served as the CEO of ARTMS Inc., a leading provider of technologies for radiopharmaceutical production. The founding board of directors is comprised of Manu Nair, chair of Corporate Development at Mayo Clinic; Justin Butler, partner at Eclipse; Mary Kate Wold, CEO and president of the Church Pension Group and a former senior executive at Wyeth; Ned Sharpless, M.D., former director of the National Cancer Institute and former acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Mike Rossi, former head of radioligand therapy and imaging at Novartis.

""Radiopharmaceuticals are proving to be highly effective treatment tools across a variety of cancer types, but the inefficiencies across the development, manufacturing and supply chain have inhibited their widespread utilization. As the field of theranostics evolves, it will be imperative that we can develop and deliver these life-changing agents effectively to all patients who may benefit from their use,"" Conroy says.

Eclipse and Mayo Clinic collaborated to build Nucleus RadioPharma, beginning with $6 million in seed funding, to bring these treatments to the market at a cost, scale and efficacy that will impact millions of lives. The organization draws on Eclipse's experience creating companies with advanced manufacturing technologies, as well as the deep oncology expertise of Mayo Clinic, one of the largest nuclear medicine practices in the world.

""Mayo Clinic is on a mission to transform our cancer care practice by integrating research with clinical care to ensure that every patient we serve, across the U.S. and the world, has access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials and the newest treatments. We believe that radiopharmaceuticals are highly innovative new therapies with tremendous potential to help cancer patients,"" says Cheryl Willman, M.D., executive director of Mayo Clinic Cancer Programs. ""The collaboration with Nucleus RadioPharma will provide enhanced manufacturing capabilities so Mayo Clinic can rapidly deliver radiopharmaceuticals, empowering us to better serve our patients today, and enabling the development and clinical testing of novel targeted radiotherapies in the future.""

Radiopharmaceuticals are poised to become a core modality of cancer diagnosis, staging and treatment, but their success has been broadly hampered by manufacturing and supply chain issues. The treatments are expensive and have short-lived radioactivity, which means they must be produced daily, often in small batches, and sometimes even individually for each patient. However, after a patient is approved to receive a radiotherapy, current supply chain limitations mean that some patients must wait more than a month for the treatment to be manufactured and delivered to the hospital.

""New therapeutic modalities, such as radiopharmaceuticals, require new infrastructure to unlock their full potential,"" says Butler. ""Together with Mayo Clinic, we are leveraging our combined expertise in clinical development, manufacturing and supply chain to evolve and enhance the radiopharmaceutical industry, allowing drug developers to access larger markets more quickly.""

""We are building Nucleus RadioPharma to be the glue that connects hospitals with radiopharmaceutical developers, providing new hope for our cancer patients,"" says Geoff Johnson, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Nuclear Medicine at Mayo Clinic. ""We are particularly excited to fast-track the next generation of therapies, which promise to be far more powerful and precise at killing cancer, but are even more challenging to produce and integrate into trials and clinical practice.""

533,"Acetylcholine regulates blood flow, but the source of blood acetylcholine has been unclear. Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have discovered that certain T cells in human blood can produce acetylcholine, which may help regulate blood pressure and inflammation. The study, which is published in PNAS, also demonstrates a possible association between these immune cells in seriously ill patients and the risk of death.

Blood flow regulation by acetylcholine is long established and highlighted by the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Yet the sources of acetylcholine in human blood have been unclear. Previous research, such as studies by Peder Olofsson's group at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, has shown that a certain type of immune cell known asChAT+ T cells can produce acetylcholine and affect endothelial cells in the blood vessels of mice. However, it has not been known if these types of T cells exist in humans.

""We now show that human T cells can also release acetylcholine,"" says the study's joint first author Laura Tarnawski, assistant professor at the Department of Medicine (Solna), Karolinska Institutet. ""This corroborates previous findings in different model systems and may contribute to the development of treatments for cardiovascular disease and inflammatory diseases.""

Acetylcholine also plays a vital role as a neurotransmitter in the brain and nervous system, but the researchers are particularly interested in its role in inflammation.

""We're interested in how the brain communicates with the immune system, which is something we still know relatively little about,"" says the other first author Vladimir Shavva, assistant professor at the same department. ""Our new study shows that acetylcholine in the blood can be secreted by immune cells, which can regulate inflammation in the blood vessels.""

The findings are based on analyses of blood from healthy blood donors. The researchers also studied 33 patients with severe circulatory failure who had been admitted for intensive care, and found that higher relative blood levels of ChAT+ T cells were associated with reduced risk of death.

""Our findings are of clinical interest and could contribute to new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for seriously ill patients with excessive inflammation,"" says principal investigator Peder Olofsson, senior researcher at the Department of Medicine (Solna).

The group now plans to map the presence of ChAT+ T cells in different patient groups and different organs, and how they affect metabolic and inflammatory processes.

The study was financed by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Heart Lung Foundation, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, MedTechLabs, the ALF project scheme, the Lars Hierta Memorial Foundation, the Gösta Fraenckel Foundation, the Loo and Hans Osterman Foundation and the Foundation for Geriatric Diseases at Karolinska Institutet. Peder Olofsson is a shareholder of Emune AB. Co-author Michael Eberhardson has received lecture and consultancy fees from AbbVie, Merck (MSD), Takeda, Ferring, Orion Pharma, Otsuka, Tillotts, ITH, Novartis, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Janssen and research grants from AbbVie and MSD.

534,"Lymphomas are blood cancers that often start from lymph nodes. Lymph nodes contain not only hematopoietic cells, mainly B- and T-lymphoid cells, but also non-hematopoietic cells (NHCs), also called stromal cells. We know from previous research that NHCs have an active role in the development of lymphomas. However, it is still not clear how they promote the expansion and proliferation of lymphomas. Despite advancement in therapeutic options, most lymphomas remain uncurable.

In a paper published in Nature Cell Biology in March 2022, researchers from the University of Tsukuba constructed an atlas of more than 100,000 NHCs collected from 27 human samples, encompassing different types of lymphomas such as follicular lymphomas. The research team used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the gene expression of the hundreds of thousands of NHCs. On the basis of this expression, the researchers divided them into different subgroups, called clusters, and discovered a significant heterogeneity of these cells. The researchers observed that this heterogeneity was detectable also in aggressive lymphomas, meaning that some of these subgroups could be involved in the progression of the tumor. They identified several subgroups of NHCs, including some that were previously unrecognized -- for example, specific types of endothelial cells. ""Once the atlas was developed, we performed differential gene expression analysis between subgroups in different types of lymph nodes affected by lymphoma,"" explains Professor Mamiko Sakata-Yanagimoto, lead author of the study, ""and interestingly we found subcluster-specific transcriptional changes and a specific pattern of interaction with malignant cells in the stroma of follicular lymphomas."" Follicular lymphomas are one of the most common types of lymphoma. Therefore, having a gene expression signature and a prediction of how NHCs can interact with malignant cells may be very useful to keep the tumor development under control, as they suggest potential biomarkers for therapeutic approaches.

Another important finding of the study suggested that human lymph nodes have unique NHC subpopulations that have not been previously detected in mouse lymph nodes. This highlights the importance of carrying out more human studies in the future.

Professor Mamiko Sakata-Yanagimoto summarized the contribution of this research by noting its potential for therapeutic applications globally: ""This single-cell atlas of NHCs in human lymph nodes that we developed is applicable to lymphoma researchers all around the world. It can provide deep insights into lymphoma stromal biology and resources applicable to future studies on lymphomas, and also identify potential stroma-derived biomarkers that may serve as clinical indicators and/or therapeutic targets.""

538,"Sept. 2, 2021 -- Shawn Farash says he questions everything and loves learning about the human body. When reports of a new virus began circulating, he became fascinated and began his research. A life-long New Yorker and the founder of Loud Majority, a conservative grassroots movement based in Long Island, Farash, 30, says he is unvaccinated and doesn't feel like he needs to be due to natural antibodies from having previously been infected with COVID-19. “Someone like myself will not just take someone’s word for it and go,” he says. “I want to see evidence. I want to see science. I want to see something factually backed up, factually bolstered.” Farash is part of the segment of the U.S. population whose trust in the many top health experts has dwindled. Much of the problem started in early 2020, during the often-controversial White House COVID-19 press briefings, as experts tried to understand the science of the new virus with the latest information. Farash says shifting recommendations for pandemic safety measures, among other concerns about health experts’ transparency on information surrounding the virus and its effects, ultimately led to confusion, and then doubts, on the science behind COVID-19 safety mandates. He, along with many who share similar views, would have preferred if health experts were more vocal about their uncertainty, he says. “You’re being told by experts, at the first part of this, ‘This is a very dangerous virus. This is a brand new virus. We don’t know much about it. But we do know that you have to do ABCDEFG to keep yourself safe,’” Farash says. “But how could that be true if you don’t know much about the virus?” Health experts must be very cautious, particularly in the early stages, because conflicting arguments can easily lead to confusion or people choosing what to believe based on what’s closest to their own beliefs, says Thomas E. Patterson, PhD, the Bradlee professor of Government and the Press at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“If they’re a little bit in the speculative realm and they put out something that they later have to retract, the truth never catches up,” Patterson says. “So, I do think it’s incumbent on those who are in positions of authority in the case of a public health issue to make sure that they’ve got their facts straight at the beginning.” But the news media also plays a role in mixed messaging surrounding COVID-19, according to Todd Gitlin, PhD, professor of journalism and sociology and chair of the PhD program in communications at Columbia University in New York City. This is largely due to some journalists not being fully knowledgeable in scientific analysis. Being well-versed before making scientific announcements is critical, particularly with a virus like COVID-19, he says. “The evolution of the virus is unfolding in real time,” Gitlin says. “If you were simply reporting the day-to-day, sort of 'state of belief' in what would be effective against the virus or even about the danger of the virus itself, you would be tracing a zigzag line, which could be quite confusing.” Brooke Elliott, 29, is unvaccinated and has also greatly lost trust in many of the country’s leading health experts and institutions, as well as much of the media. From Virginia, she had gone back to school prior to the pandemic, but is now caring for her young child at home for the time being. Like Farash, she also has recovered from COVID and feels her natural antibodies are now sufficient protection from reinfection or serious illness. Elliott says her doubts began to rise in late 2020, when information on COVID-19 and vaccines fully transformed from right and wrong to right and left, specifically partisan politics. “There was just a growing pattern of inconsistencies,” Elliott says. “The politicization of COVID started to kind of emerge more and more. I think with it being an election year, candidates kind of pull from anything and everything to make it take on a different political nature as well. I think that bias kind of began to creep up. Is this 100% about COVID now or is this kind of becoming something else or is there a dual purpose?”

Early in the pandemic, there was a generally high amount of trust in both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, says Liz Hamel, vice president and director of the Public Opinion and Survey Research Program at Kaiser Family Foundation. “Over time, that total trust has eroded, but has really diverged along partisan lines, with republican trust dropping rapidly,” Hamel says. This pattern could lead to problems if there are future public health crises or pandemics, she says. “I think to the extent that politics continues to be a factor in how we handle public health, it will continue,” Hamel says. However, there are ways to possibly combat this issue. “One thing I would say that we’ve learned in our research is that people trust individual healthcare providers at this point much more than they trust sort of national or even local public health messengers,” Hamel says. “I think people are more likely to be open to considering information that conflicts with their preconceived notions when it comes from their own healthcare providers than when it comes from a talking head on TV.” But political leaders can also play a role in restoring trust, particularly when choosing to stand behind public health experts, says Shanto Iyengar, PhD, professor of political science and director of the political communication laboratory at Stanford University. “Decades of research demonstrates that the public follows the views of their preferred leaders,” Iyengar says. Elliott says the pandemic has caused her to view the world through a new set of eyes. She now operates with a “sliding scale of skepticism” vs. confident trust of any particular person or source. Many who have similar distrust would likely be more understanding of inconsistencies from health experts if reactions to their uncertainty weren’t so harsh, Elliott says. “That curiosity and asking those questions, instead of being a natural and welcomed response, has received huge amounts of criticism and has been censored in many cases. That starts to raise more suspicions,” she says.

For instance, a sizeable portion of unvaccinated adults have doubts about the science surrounding COVID-19 vaccines specifically. Because it’s possible this group could become more open to getting the vaccine, some messaging can be counterproductive, according to Gitlin. “I think simply preaching to people, sermonizing, and beating up on people who are resistant to vaccination is probably not effective,” Gitlin says. “Maybe the people who are resistant, I think, are already resentful of being talked down to and suspicious of government interventions.” It’s also important to remember that people choose to remain unvaccinated for various reasons, Gitlin says. For example, this can be seen in vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans that largely stems from the infamous Tuskegee Study that spanned from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Black men who were told they were receiving syphilis treatment weren’t treated and instead studied to understand progressive effects of the disease, which resulted in many preventable deaths. “But we also know that there are people whose resistance is simply out of suspicion of all establishments, especially medical establishments, media establishments, political, corporate,” Gitlin says. Farash says that he hopes his trust in health experts and institutions will be restored. But first, the public’s trust in each other needs mending. “Do you know how many times I’ve been told that because I’m asking questions, I’m putting people’s lives at risk?” Farash says. “I don’t think that’s appropriate. I just want answers. I want to know what we’re doing. I want to know why the rules are what they are. Why is the speed limit 60 miles an hour in Upstate New York but only 55 miles an hour in Long Island?”",0
541,"CHICAGO — For J. William Charboneau, M.D., life is a journey of unknown possibilities, filled with family. And Tuesday, Nov. 28, with family both personal and professional by his side and in the audience, Dr. Charboneau’s journey reached another destination.

Read more about Dr. Charboneau's atypical route to pioneering radiologist here.

Dr. Charboneau, an emeritus professor of radiology at Mayo Clinic, thanked those family members — his wife, colleagues, friends, protégés and mentors — as he received the 2017 Gold Medal from the Radiological Society of North America at its 103rd Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting in Chicago. The Radiological Society of North America Board of Directors determines Gold Medal winners, who must receive a unanimous vote. Considered the Radiological Society of North America's highest honor, the medal is given to “those persons who, in the judgment of the board, have rendered unusual service to the science of radiology.”

Especially meaningful for Dr. Charboneau was the award’s presenter, Richard Ehman, M.D., a diagnostic radiologist at Mayo Clinic and current president of the Radiological Society of North America board of directors.

Dr. Ehman has been one of those family members and an esteemed colleague.

“In so many ways, we have a family in radiology, and you can sense it in the room. We all pick up wherever we were in the conversation of the past,” Dr. Charboneau says. “This is a family story that’s playing out.”

Receiving the Gold Medal is an honor ─ one that is both humbling and gratifying, Dr. Charboneau says.

“Being recognized by one’s peers in this way is both a high honor and it’s a very precious thing,” Dr. Charboneau says. “I feel gratitude to the society for selecting me for the award. It’s clearly the highlight of my professional career ─ a moment I will always highlight and cherish. I also feel gratitude for the team at Mayo that made this possible and the colleagues worldwide, where we all work together. I share this award with these collaborators, with these co-workers, with these colleagues throughout the world. While I’m getting the Gold Medal, it’s really about us. It’s a story about us, and I thank them for that work that we all did together.”

Dr. Ehman says the Gold Medal recognizes Dr. Charboneau’s role as a leading authority in diagnostic ultrasound and a pioneer in image-guided treatment of cancers of liver, kidney, lung and bone. This is not the first time that the Radiological Society of North America has recognized the importance of Dr. Charboneau’s work and the benefits to patients worldwide. In 2006, the society asked him to present the New Horizons Lecture, titled, “Image-Guided Cancer Treatment: The Science and Vision of an Emerging Field,” which reflected his role in advancing a new discipline, interventional oncology. This discipline seeks out cancer treatment options beyond surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

“He is a world-renowned clinician, educator and visionary who helped translate many advanced applications of imaging and intervention,” Dr. Ehman says. “His innovations, leadership and advocacy were instrumental in the introduction and adoption of image-guided percutaneous tumor ablation.”

“Thank you to my colleagues,” he adds. “I’ve been so fortunate to have such good friends and colleagues over the years. I literally could not wait to come in each day with each of them, and I thank them for being such terrific co-workers and colleagues. … We radiologists value the friendship and collegiality at great meetings like this one. We value the sharing of ideas and the learning from one another that occurs at this meeting.

“To the young people in the audience, I would love to be in your shoes right now. Because the opportunities you have in imaging and image-guided intervention are incredible, and I know you are going to find this a wonderfully dynamic and engaging medical specialty, and you definitely made the right choice in picking radiology. I would pick it again in a heartbeat.”

551,"Feb. 23, 2023 – The flu vaccine has been highly effective this year, the CDC says, despite flu season getting off to one of the earliest and strongest starts on record.

“Vaccination provided substantial protection against inpatient, emergency department and outpatient illness across all ages,” said Mark Tenforde, MD, of the CDC’s Influenza Division, according to CNN.

Health officials estimate that, so far this flu season, vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization due to the respiratory virus by nearly 50% among adults, and by nearly 75% among children.

Each season, the vaccine is different and is formulated in advance to target strains of the virus predicted to be in wide circulation. The accuracy of the predictions can vary widely. In recent years, effectiveness has ranged from 29% to 40%, although historically the rate has dipped as low as 10% or done as well as 60%.

This season, positive flu cases peaked during the end of November and early December, when 26% of all tests came back positive. The mid-holiday season surge caused alarm that the flu could overwhelm hospitals, many of which were already grappling with high levels of another respiratory virus known as RSV. Instead, flu levels have steadily declined and, currently, just 1.7% of all tests are positive for flu.",0
552,"Steroid treatment before birth appears to improve survival and reduce complications among extremely preterm infants, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. Antenatal steroid therapy, given to women at risk of preterm delivery, causes the fetal lungs to mature and has been shown to improve survival and reduce complications among infants born from 24 to 34 weeks of pregnancy. However, previous studies of the treatment for infants born between the 22nd and 23rd week — those at greatest risk for death and disability — were inconclusive.

The study was conducted by Sanjay Chawla, M.D., at Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, and Wayne State University, Detroit, and colleagues at 17 U.S. research institutions. It appears in JAMA Network Open. Funding was provided by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

Of the mothers of the 431 infants in the study, 110 did not receive the steroid betamethasone, 80 received partial treatment (one dose) and 241 received complete treatment (two doses 24 hours apart).

Of the infants exposed to complete treatment, 53.9% survived until hospital discharge, compared to 37.5% with partial treatment and 35.5% with no treatment. Compared to infants receiving no treatment, infants exposed to full treatment were 1.95 times more likely to survive and 2.74 times more likely to survive without major complications such as severe bleeding in the brain, severe lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), cysts in brain, severe inflammation of the intestines (necrotizing enterocolitis) or abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina (retinopathy of prematurity needing treatment).

The study authors concluded that their results provide strong evidence to support giving antenatal steroid therapy to pregnant people at risk for delivery at 22 weeks.

554,"Research led by Associate Professor Duc Dong, Ph.D., has shown for the first time that the effects of Alagille syndrome, an incurable genetic disorder that affects the liver, could be reversed with a single drug. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has the potential to transform treatment for this rare disease and may also have implications for more common diseases.

""Alagille syndrome is widely considered an incurable disease, but we believe we're on the way to changing that,"" says Dong, who is also the associate dean of admissions for Sanford Burnham Prebys' graduate school. ""We aim to advance this drug into clinical trials, and our results demonstrate its effectiveness for the first time.""

More than 4,000 babies each year are born with Alagille syndrome, which is caused by a mutation that prevents the formation and regeneration of bile ducts in the liver. Children with Alagille syndrome frequently require a liver transplant, but donor livers are limited, and not all children with Alagille syndrome qualify. Without a transplant, the disease has a 75% mortality rate by late adolescence.

""Duc and his team continue to do thrilling research on Alagille syndrome, and these breakthroughs certainly offer hope for families living with this very complicated and complex disorder,"" says Roberta Smith, CNMT, president of the Alagille Syndrome Alliance. ""We have been longtime supporters of Duc's work and have come to know him as a driven, dedicated scientist who is passionate about moving the needle one step closer toward a cure.""

Their new drug, called NoRA1, activates the Notch pathway, a cell-to-cell signaling system present in nearly all animals. Notch signaling helps orchestrate fundamental biological processes and plays a role in many diseases in addition to Alagille syndrome. In children with Alagille syndrome, a genetic mutation causes a reduction in Notch signaling, which results in poor liver duct growth and regeneration.

The researchers found that in animals with mutations in the same gene affected in Alagille syndrome, NoRA1 increases Notch signaling and triggers duct cells to regenerate and repopulate in the liver, reversing liver damage and increasing survival.

""The liver is well known for its great capacity to regenerate, but this doesn't happen in most children with Alagille syndrome because of compromised Notch signaling,"" says first author Chengjian Zhao, a postdoctoral researcher in Dong's lab. ""Our research suggests that nudging the Notch pathway up with a drug could be enough to restore the liver's normal regenerative potential.""

The researchers are currently testing the drug on miniature livers cultured in the lab with stem cells derived from the cells of Alagille patients.

""Instead of forcing the cells to do something unusual, we are just encouraging a natural regenerative process to occur, so I'm optimistic that this will be an effective therapeutic for Alagille syndrome,"" adds Dong.

Dong is also taking steps to form a start-up company to drive this drug toward clinical trials. The new company will initially focus on Alagille syndrome, but also plans to develop this drug for other, more prevalent diseases, including certain cancers.",0

An international team of scientists from Australia and China have, for the first time, shown in a study published in Nature Medicine, that a natural immune system protein called IL-2 can help restore balance to the overactive immune system of lupus patients. The drug could soon be rolled out for clinical trials in lupus treatment.

Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute researcher, Dr Di Yu and Professor Zhanguo Li from Peking University People's Hospital in China co-led the study.

Dr Yu said he hoped the drug could be approved as a lupus treatment within a handful of years.

""This drug, which can help the immune system fight against cancer, was approved in the 1990s but is not commonly used now. We're now using this drug for a different purpose, based on our new knowledge of the immune system,"" Dr Yu said.

""The amount we tested for treating lupus is much less than the dose used in treating cancers. We observed the treatment was safe and showed promising results, so there's reason to believe formal trials could begin almost immediately,"" he said.

Dr Yu said lupus could be a serious disease, and that it hadn't been able to be treated in a very satisfactory way in the past.

Professor Eric Morand, fellow Monash University researcher on the study and founder of the Asia Pacific Lupus Collaboration, said that in this study, IL-2 was given to people whose lupus wasn't responding well to standard treatments.

""The real promise of this treatment is that it calms the hyperactive immune system through multiple mechanisms, which is very important as this new therapy may be effective for many patients,"" Professor Morand said.

""As the drug has been on the market for some time for other diseases, it can be rapidly put into formal trials for lupus treatment right away.""

Co-first authors Dr Xia Zhang from Peking University People's Hospital in China, and Associate Professor Yunbo Wei, from Shandong Academy of Sciences, performed a large part of the research, both visiting Monash University to train with Dr Yu and carry out the research.

The researchers' work was supported by several international funding bodies, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and the Priority Research Program of the Shandong Academy of Sciences.

561,"Extremely rare gene variants point to a potential cause of age-related macular degeneration

A study from the National Eye Institute (NEI) identified rare genetic variants that could point to one of the general mechanisms driving age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision loss in older adults. The variants generate malformed proteins that alter the stability of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which may drive a chronic inflammatory response in the retina. The findings, published in the journal iScience, point to MAC as a potential therapeutic target to slow or prevent the development of AMD. NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.

There are many known genetic variants that raise or lower an individual’s risk of getting AMD; however, the contribution of each of these genetic changes to AMD is small.

To discover genetic variants – and proteins – with a direct tie to the disease, Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., chief of NEI’s Neurobiology, Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory, and lead author of the study, undertook a collaboration with Michael Klein, M.D., a leading AMD clinician at the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), Portland. Klein has collected clinical information for hundreds of patients, as well as families with a high number of individuals with AMD. Swaroop, Klein and colleagues looked for families carrying very rare AMD-causing variants, where the effect of the gene variant is very strong, and where the variant directly affects protein structure and function. This type of rare variant can reveal the root cause of disease.

“While we have known about many genetic variants that affect AMD risk, only a few have pointed directly to protein alterations that can cause AMD,” said Swaroop. “By looking at large families with ultra-rare variants that track closely with disease across generations, we found two proteins that may directly be the driving force behind AMD pathology in affected patients. These proteins could be targets for future drugs.” While there are currently some treatments to slow vision loss for people with the wet form of AMD, there is no treatment for most patients and no cure for the disease.

Swaroop, Klein and colleagues found that in four families, individuals with AMD have mutations in one of two proteins that form one end of MAC: C8-alpha and C8-beta. The team found that the variants from the four AMD families all affected the ability of the C8 proteins to stick to each other, which may alter how MAC behaves in the eye’s retina.

MAC forms a circular pore, closed at one end by the C8 proteins; the MAC pore permits the flow of ions through the outer membrane of cells. This pore is the final step in the ‘complement cascade,’ a part of the immune system that helps the body defend against pathogens. Although scientists initially thought that MAC’s only function was to insert into bacterial cell membranes and kill the pathogen, more recent evidence shows that MAC plays a complex role in regulating inflammatory processes in tissues like the retina.

Genetic data from NEI’s Age Related Eye Disease Studies have suggested roles for C8 proteins, as well as other proteins higher up in the complement cascade, in AMD. Because MAC is the final step in the complement cascade, variants affecting any of the complement proteins may funnel down to alter MAC function. The researchers believe that either too much or too little stable MAC in the retina may lead to destructive inflammation, which in turn drives AMD progression.

“Given that MAC is the end of the immune system’s complement pathway, and because there’s such a strong link between these rare variants and disease, we think that targeting it may be a more effective strategy to control AMD,” Swaroop said. “With a small molecule drug, we might be able to control how strongly MAC drives inflammation, and from there slow down progression of AMD.”

The research was funded by the National Eye Institute, as well as Research to Prevent Blindness, the Retina Research Foundation, and the Casey Eye Institute Macular Degeneration Center.

567,"Study will help women make informed decisions about screening tests in the future.

The Tomosynthesis Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST), the first randomized trial to compare two types of digital mammography for breast cancer screening, is now open for enrollment. The study was developed by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. ECOG-ACRIN is leading the trial.

TMIST researchers are enrolling healthy women ages 45 to 74 who are already planning to get routine mammograms. By taking part in TMIST, the 165,000 planned participants will provide critical information that will help researchers learn how to most effectively screen women for breast cancer and help women make informed decisions about the screening tests in the future.

“Nearly 50 million screening mammograms occur each year in the United States, yet it has been decades since a large-scale randomized trial of mammography has been done,” said Worta McCaskill-Stevens, M.D., director of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), the NCI program supporting the trial. “The evolution of mammography technology provides us with an opportunity to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about two available breast cancer screening tests.”

TMIST is comparing two types of digital mammography approved by the Food and Drug Administration: tomosynthesis (known as three-dimensional, or 3-D) and conventional (two-dimensional, or 2-D). Although 3-D mammography, being the newer technology, is likely to detect more findings that require follow-up, it is also likely to lead to more procedures and treatments. It is not known if this newer mammography technology is reducing a woman’s risk of developing a life-threatening (advanced) cancer compared with 2-D mammography. The TMIST trial aims to find out.

“We need to determine if 3-D mammography is better than 2-D at finding the sort of breast cancers that are most likely to spread and kill women,” said ECOG-ACRIN study chair Etta D. Pisano, M.D., vice chair of research in the Department of Radiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor in residence of radiology at Harvard Medical School, Boston. “If a newer screening technology does not reduce the numbers of advanced, life-threatening cancers, then are we really improving screening for breast cancer?”

TMIST researchers are collecting data on the results of every mammogram, whether the imaging shows no signs of cancer, findings suspicious of cancer, or a breast cancer. Any medical follow-ups, such as more imaging or biopsies, are also being reported. TMIST researchers intend to follow all participants for breast cancer status, treatment, and outcomes from the time of randomization until the end of the study (at least 2025).

Based on the findings of earlier studies, researchers know that the vast majority of women in the study will not develop breast cancer. If a woman does receive a diagnosis of any kind of breast cancer while in the trial, she will receive treatment just as she would if she was not part of TMIST, while continuing to be part of the trial.

In addition to data from mammograms, the trial is building a biorepository for future research on genetic markers for breast cancer by asking all participants to voluntarily submit blood samples and swabs of cells from inside the mouth (buccal cells). This data could, in the future, help women and their doctors decide the best ways to screen for breast cancer by evaluating their individual risk factors for developing the disease. TMIST researchers are also analyzing tissue collected from women who have biopsies during the trial because of mammogram findings that require follow-up. This is to learn more about the biology of breast cancers detected through screening.

About 100 mammography clinics in the United States are planning to participate in the trial and are opening on a rolling basis over the next several months. Women are being told about the opportunity to enroll in the trial when they schedule a routine mammogram. Once enrolled, they will be assigned to either 2-D or 3-D mammography screening. Most women enrolled in the trial will be screened annually. Postmenopausal women with no high-risk factors will be screened every two years.

To ensure a diverse group of participants, sites are well represented both geographically and by the race/ethnicity of the women the sites serve. Several Canadian clinics are joining the trial, having already enrolled more than 3,000 women in a smaller lead-in study that is helping to inform TMIST.

571,"Oct. 13, 2022 — If you live with inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease, or irritable bowel syndrome and it’s affecting your sex life, you’re not alone. These GI conditions are the ones most associated with sexual issues, including erectile dysfunction and loss of libido in men and pain during intercourse for women. The good news: Treatments can help. The bad news: Few doctors or patients bring up these intimate challenges during a doctor visit, a new survey finds. Only 4% of patients and 29% of gastroenterologists start a conversation about sexual dysfunction, for instance. Of the 426 doctors surveyed, 80% said lack of knowledge was the main reason. Another 58% said they don’t have enough experience in this area, 44% said they don’t have enough time, and 30% said they are embarrassed. ""While patients with gastrointestinal disorders often experience sexual dysfunction, discussions around the matter are not routine in gastroenterological care,"" Marco Romano, MD, from the University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli,"" in Naples, Italy, said at this year’s United European Gastroenterology (UEG) 2022 meeting in Vienna.

this is a quality-of-life issue for their patients, Romano says. Most doctors would welcome more education and training in this area during medical school, residency, or as experienced doctors. And many doctors surveyed think patients would welcome a doctor respectfully asking if their GI disorder interferes with their intimate relationships. This discussion ""is often considered a relief to patients who find that the gastrointestinal problem and the sexual dysfunction are interlinked,"" Romano said. GI and other medications could be partly to blame, like certain drugs to help control acid reflux. Nearly 15% of clinicians said that prokinetic agents played a role in patients’ sexual dysfunction, and 18% cited proton pump inhibitors. Both drug classes are considered responsible for sexual troubles. The pros and cons of different medications should be discussed with patients, said Asma Fikree, MD, PhD, from the Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust in London. The survey also stresses the importance of asking patients about sexual dysfunction, Fikree said.

“We might do it in men and ask about erectile dysfunction, but we are very poor about asking in women,"" said Fikree, who moderated the session at UEG. ""Some patients might not be very bothered by sexual dysfunction, but others might consider it very important.” ""We should be considering this as part of their treatment and care.""",0

573,"A highly pathogenic avian influenza has been spreading in the U.S., making headlines as the price of eggs soared at the start of the year and fears of the next zoonotic pandemic creep into popular media. A University of Maryland (UMD)-led team of researchers tracked the arrival and progression of the deadly bird flu (H5N1) in North America to determine how this outbreak is different from previous ones.

The team found that the deadly impact on wild birds and a shift from seasonal to year-round infections signal dangerous changes in avian influenza in the U.S. They concluded that there is an urgent need for unprecedented coordination at a national and regional-scale to manage the spread of a disease reaching across jurisdictions and disciplines. The team also suggests that H5N1 will likely become endemic, potentially posing risks to food security and the economy.

The paper was published April 19, 2023, in the journal Conservation Biology.

""We've been dealing with low pathogenic avian influenza for decades in the poultry industry, but this is different."" said Jennifer Mullinax, assistant professor in the UMD Department of Environmental Science & Technology and a co-author of the study. Low pathogenic disease is less contagious and easier to contain than the highly pathogenic variety.

""This high pathogenic virus is wiping out everything in numbers that we've never seen before,"" Mullinax said. ""This paper illustrates how unprecedented it is, and describes what we think is coming. It's really a call to arms saying, we can't afford to address this from our individual silos. Federal agencies, state agencies, the agriculture sector and wildlife management, we are all going to have to deal with this together, because we can't afford not to.""

The team's conclusions are based on an analysis of five different data sources that provide information on the incidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds and poultry focusing on the USA and Canada as well as a global database from 2014 through early 2023.

The data show the progression of highly pathogenic H5N1 as it spread from Eurasia to the U.S. where it was first documented in late 2021. By October 2022, the disease had resulted in 31 reported wild bird mass mortalities, accounting for an estimated 33,504 wild bird detections in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, more than 58 million domestic poultry were infected or had to be culled to limit the spread of infection in the U.S. and 7 million in Canada.

In 2015, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 in the U.S. led to the culling of 50 million poultry birds. But the disease was eradicated in North America that same year, largely because it did not seriously impact wild birds, which made containment through culling poultry relatively easy. But H5N1 poses new challenges.

""Unlike H5N8, this disease is heavily impacting wild birds,"" said Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher at UMD and lead author of the study. ""It's difficult to estimate how many birds are truly affected across wild populations, but we're seeing dramatic disease impacts in raptors, sea birds and colonial nesting birds. And we now have the highest amount of poultry loss to avian influenza, so this is a worst-case scenario.""

The data also reveals a shift from a seasonal to a year-round disease. Previous outbreaks of avian influenza -- whether low pathogenic virus that is endemic in the U.S. or highly pathogenic H5N8 in 2015 -- typically occurred in the fall, which meant farmers could prepare for seasonal outbreaks, cull flocks to halt the spread of disease, and have nearly a full year to recover losses. But this new virus appears sustained throughout the year, with summertime disease detections in wild birds and poultry outbreaks occurring in both the spring and fall.

Although declaring a disease endemic is a complicated process, the authors of the study suggest that the U.S. will likely follow patterns seen in Europe where highly pathogenic avian influenza is already being treated as an endemic disease rather than something that can be eradicated.

The research team recommends a management approach based on a method called Structured Decision-Making, which follows a specific process of identifying and bringing together relevant individuals with an interest, expertise or stake in an issue, distinguishing the unknown from the known factors and establishing measurable goals and actions with quantifiable results. The process is much like dealing with a human pandemic.

""Good decision science is what you do when you don't know what is going to happen next,"" said Mullinax, who teaches decision-making science. ""This is a novel virus for North American birds, so no one knows if their immune systems will adapt, or how long that will take, or what that will look like. Where do we direct our funds for maximum benefit? Is it a vaccine? How do we track it in wild birds? Do we test the water or the soil? What are the triggers for different actions, and how do we measure if we're succeeding? These decisions have to be made on multiple scales.""

The paper outlines examples of potential triggers for action, identifying the relevant decision-makers required to coordinate a response and some of the challenges that may come up. The researchers hope their work will bring key players to the table to consider the next steps.",0

• A new study finds people who use both vape and smoke traditional cigarettes are unlikely to completely switch to e-cigs.
• The majority of people in the study thought vaping was less harmful than smoking, which is supported by some research — at least over the short and medium term.
• The study findings fits with other research showing that adults tend to stick with combustible cigarettes more than with e-cigarettes. Some cigarette users take up vaping to help them quit smoking, or with the intention of switching to e-cigarettes altogether. But real-world research suggests that many adults who smoke cigarettes and vape — what’s known as dual use — continue smoking over the long term, sometimes alongside e-cigarettes. “This study suggests that at the population level, vaping may not help people kick the smoking habit,” study author Nandita Krishnan, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., said in a press release. “People who concurrently use e-cigarettes and cigarettes experience increased health risks, and both products deliver nicotine, which is addictive,” she added. “We should be trying to help them quit both smoking and vaping.” Krishnan was a researcher in the Department of Prevention and Community Health at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington, D.C., at the time the study was conducted. The study was published Dec. 13 in the journal Tobacco Control.

In the study, researchers examined data for 2013 to 2019 from the U.S. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a national longitudinal study of tobacco use. The same people fill out this survey every year, so researchers are able to look at how dual users’ tobacco use changes over time: Do they quit smoking cigarettes? Do they give up e-cigarettes? Do they quit both or continue using both? Researchers identified 545 adults from the first year who reported being a current e-cigarette user and cigarette user — meaning they vape and smoke every day or on some days. By the last year, researchers had complete data on 541 of these people. For the study, e-cigarettes included other electronic nicotine products such as e-cigars, e-pipes and e-hookahs. During the first year, just over half of the dual users were between 25 and 44 years old; just over half were men; and around three-quarters were non-Hispanic white. In addition, around 3 out of 4 individuals smoked cigarettes daily, about 1 in 3 vaped daily, almost 2 out of 3 drank alcohol. About 1 in 4 smoked cannabis. The majority of people thought vaping was less harmful than smoking, which is supported by some research — at least over the short- and medium-term. However, Thomas Ylioja, PhD, a cessation expert and clinical director of health initiatives at National Jewish Health in Denver, said we don’t have a lot of information on the health impacts of long-term e-cigarette use, because these products have been around a relatively short time. “It took about 20 to 30 years to really have a full understanding that cigarettes could cause cancer,” he said. “And it’s taken us about 70 years to really understand the magnitude of harm from smoking cigarettes.” Ylioja was not involved in the new research.

Many quit vaping, but keep smoking Over the six years of the study, the proportion of people who vaped dropped to 41%, while the proportion of smokers fell to 68%. Researchers grouped people by their smoking and vaping behaviors. About two-thirds of vapers stopped vaping early on — by about half-way through — while the rest continued vaping. In contrast, just over half of smokers continued smoking, while just over one-quarter steadily quit using cigarettes across all years. Under 20% quit smoking early on or by halfway through the study. Researchers also looked at the combined patterns of vaping and smoking. The most common pattern —occurring in four in ten people — was stopping vaping early, but continuing to smoke. “That’s concerning, because if electronic cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes — at least in the short term — then most people were continuing to use the more harmful products and not the less harmful products,” said Ylioja. This fits with other research showing that adults tend to stick with combustible cigarettes more than with e-cigarettes. The results of the new study also show that just one in ten people quit both vaping and smoking early on, while around one in seven people continued to use both tobacco products. Those early quitters of both products were more likely to smoke cigarettes less than daily, researchers found. They write that this suggests “that smoking reduction could help dual users to quit using both products.” Ylioja said this isn’t surprising, because non-daily use suggests that a person had a lower level of nicotine dependence.

What the researchers found in this study “tracks with what we see in other studies — that those who smoke less or are non-daily smokers are more likely to quit,” he said. Because this is an observational study, researchers can’t show that e-cigarette use impacted cigarette use, or vice versa. Researchers also had to rely on participants’ self-reports of smoking and vaping habits, and they didn’t have information on which e-cigarettes people used. Ylioja said as a result, the results should be viewed with some caution, because e-cigarettes that people were using early during the study period were not efficient at delivering nicotine. “One of the reasons people stopped using e-cigarettes in some of these earlier studies is because they weren’t getting enough nicotine from the device,” he said. “They would describe them as being less satisfying than smoking a cigarette.” Newer e-cigarettes have gotten better at delivering nicotine, so PATH data from more recent years may show different vape trends for dual users. Future studies will need to examine these data.",0
577,"A team from Université Laval and the CERVO Brain Research Centre has demonstrated the efficacy in mice of a new therapy that addresses the main manifestation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The researchers developed an antibody that reduces the number of TDP-43 protein aggregates in the brains of mice with ALS, resulting in significant improvements in their cognitive and motor performance. Details of this breakthrough were recently published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

""ALS is characterized by a degeneration of the neurons that control muscle activity,"" explained Jean-Pierre Julien, principal investigator and professor at Université Laval' Faculty of Medicine. ""It causes a progressive weakening of the arms and legs followed by paralysis and, two to five years later, respiratory problems that lead to death. There is no treatment for this disease, which affects 1 in 1,000 adults.""

Dr. Julien and his team had already demonstrated in previous work that TDP-43 protein was overexpressed in the spinal cords of people with ALS. This overexpression leads to the formation of TDP-43 aggregates in nerve cells and an exaggerated inflammatory response that increases the neurons' vulnerability.

In their most recent study, Professor Julien and his colleagues produced an antibody that targets the TDP-43 protein. They inserted the genetic material encoding this antibody into viruses that were then injected into the nervous system of mice producing TDP-43 aggregates. ""We subsequently observed a reduction in the number of aggregates of this protein,"" explained Professor Julien. ""We also found a decrease in the immune response and a significant improvement in the mice's cognitive and motor performance.""

This breakthrough paves the way for the development of immunotherapies for ALS and frontotemporal dementias involving TDP-43 aggregates. ""We are now trying to develop an approach that would not require the use of viruses,"" Professor Julien added. ""Preliminary results suggest that injecting TDP-43 antibodies directly into the cerebrospinal fluid could effectively reduce protein aggregates in nerve cells.""

580,"Hearing loss cases are climbing globally -- 1 in 5 adults are affected -- along with a growing number of older workers who are more likely to experience hearing loss. A new study from researchers at Portland State, Oregon State and York universities sheds light on how the severity of an employee's hearing loss can impact their experience at work -- and the steps managers and employers can take to create a more inclusive environment for deaf or hard-of-hearing employees.

The study builds on prior research that says employees with hearing loss experience isolation at work, which can be detrimental to their career outcomes, and finds that tailored support can counter those experiences.

The results suggest that the severity of an employee's hearing loss influences the degree to which they rely on professional connections for their sense of self, which then has downstream consequences for career outcomes. This is especially true among employees who have an unsupportive supervisor.

The study found that employees with more severe hearing loss tend to fare better, in large part because they tend to disengage from relationships with others at work. The researchers suggest that employees with more severe hearing loss are more likely to experience awkward, anxious and frustrating interactions with co-workers and have a harder time building and maintaining professional connections. Those workers often protect themselves by putting less importance on professional connections. When they care less and are less sensitive to fewer professional connections, their sense of isolation is not as high.

""We are not recommending that managers and supervisors stop worrying about supporting employees with more severe hearing loss; we're suggesting they offer tailored support,"" said Liu-Qin Yang, a professor of industrial-organizational psychology at PSU. She said that even if self-isolation is an effective coping mechanism, those employees ultimately have worse career outcomes in the areas of attitudes, commitment, satisfaction and salary levels.

Yang's co-authors Brent Lyons of York University and David Baldridge of Oregon State, who are both hard of hearing, offered insights into what that tailored support could look like.

Lyons, whose hearing loss fluctuates from severe to profound to moderate, says his needs vary and it's helpful when supervisors create a sense of openness for him to request certain accommodations. In one meeting, he might need to be seated next to the speaker; in another, he might need closed captions on the screen.

""That might not always be the case for me and my needs may change,"" Lyons said. ""But I really appreciate when supervisors are open and touch base on a regular basis: 'How are things going? What can we do to make sure that you can fully participate?'""

Baldridge, who has experienced full hearing, deafness and now restored hearing with cochlear implants, said flexibility -- focusing on the results and not how the work is done -- is also important.

When it comes to facilitating professional connections, Baldridge said that organizing a one-on-one meeting or lunch in a quiet location would be more effective for an employee with hearing loss than trying to introduce them to people at a cocktail party. Supervisors can also connect them with employee resource groups or organizations such as the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA) and the Association of Late Deafened Adults (ALDA).

Lyons also said that it's important for supervisors to create a culture of respect and understanding among all of their employees.

""They can advocate on my behalf so co-workers don't start to think negatively about me if I don't attend a loud, busy event,"" he said. ""That could lead to fewer opportunities, which would negatively affect my career.""

The researchers are clear that, regardless of the severity of an employee's hearing loss, managers can play a critical role in making them feel included by working to understand their abilities, perceptions and limitations and helping them build professional connections that will be helpful throughout their careers.

After adjusting for demographics, Black patients were three times more likely to develop these sleep disturbances. The findings were published in Journal of General Internal Medicine.

“Sleep difficulties and fatigue are widely reported by people with long COVID but little is known about the severity and factors associated with these symptoms,” said Cinthya Pena Orbea, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Cleveland Clinic’s Sleep Disorders Center and lead author of the study. “We leveraged data from Cleveland Clinic’s reCOVer Clinic for people with long COVID to better understand these associations.”

The team analyzed data collected from 962 adult patients with long COVID – known clinically as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) – in Cleveland Clinic’s reCOVer Clinic between February 2021 and April 2022. The patients had recovered from COVID-19 and completed the sleep disturbance and fatigue questionnaires of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.

More than two-thirds of patients (67.2%) reported moderate to severe fatigue, while 21.8% reported severe fatigue. More than half of the patients (58%) reported normal to mild disturbances, while 41.3% indicated moderate to severe sleep disturbances.

“Our findings not only emphasize the importance of identification of sleep disturbance in long COVID considering its impact on patients’ quality of life, daytime functioning and medical health status but they also draw the attention to the persistent inequities seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Pena Orbea.

Reena Mehra, M.D., director of Sleep Disorders Research at Cleveland Clinic and senior author of this investigation, said, “There is an unmet need to understand the neurobiological mechanisms or pathways behind the association of sleep disturbances with long COVID and, per our findings, investigate the reasons for the increased vulnerability of PASC-related sleep disturbance in the Black population so that we can develop race-specific interventions to overcome disparities.”",0

• The FDA is responsible for reviewing data on vaccines, drugs, and medical devices, and deciding whether these products should be approved for use in the United States.
• A new report in the medical journal BMJ claims that the FDA did not inspect enough clinical trial sites.
• The FDA has just 89 inspectors for its bioresearch monitoring program. Experts say the Food and Drug Administration’s oversight of clinical trials for new vaccines and drugs is “grossly inadequate,” according to an investigative report released Wednesday by . The report documents what experts say is a failure of the FDA to not only inspect clinical trial sites, but also notify the public and scientific journals when it has identified violations at those sites. While some of these problems occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel restrictions and other measures limited the FDA’s ability to do on-site inspections, experts say the agency’s problems are not new.

The FDA is responsible for reviewing data on vaccines, drugs, and medical devices, and deciding whether these products should be approved for use in the United States. In addition, the agency conducts of certain clinical trial sites to verify the accuracy of data from that site, in response to complaints about the site or concerns from the study sponsor, or for other reasons. According to the BMJ report, very few sites involved in testing COVID-19 vaccines or drugs were inspected by the FDA before those products were approved by the agency. For example, nine of 153 Pfizer-BioNTech trial sites, 10 of 99 Moderna trial sites, and five of 73 remdesivir trial sites were inspected, writes investigative journalist Maryanne Demasi, author of the BMJ report.

During the early months of the pandemic, between March and July 2020, the FDA halted routine clinical trial inspections, instead on “mission critical” inspections. One expert interviewed by The BMJ said that instead of cutting back on inspections at this time — when COVID-19 vaccines and drugs were being developed at “warp speed” — the agency should have been ramping up its oversight.

The FDA told Healthline that it “takes its oversight of clinical trials very seriously, and continued in-person inspections in the United States and other countries during the pandemic. “We prioritized inspections for COVID-related products, including vaccines, ensuring FDA-regulated COVID-19 products are able to be used to save American lives,” the agency spokesperson said. In addition, the agency developed new oversight tools to continue its work during the pandemic, including remote site evaluation using live streaming and remote records requests, the spokesperson said. However, one expert told The BMJ that it is not possible to do a thorough inspection remotely, because inspectors need to examine every aspect of the site — such as cleanliness, organization, and staff coordination. Lack of clinical trial site inspections by the FDA is not new. Between 2000 and 2005, the FDA audited fewer than 1% of the country’s clinical trial sites, according to a 2007 report by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General. Currently, the FDA has only 89 inspectors for its bioresearch monitoring program, the agency told The BMJ, but has a goal of increasing this to an average of 100 per year. These inspectors are responsible for monitoring thousands of sites in the United States and other countries, the report said.

Experts who spoke to The BMJ are also concerned about the lack of transparency around the results of inspections, including violations that are uncovered at clinical trial sites. The FDA its inspection reports online, which are available to the public. But The BMJ said these are not comprehensive, and extensive redactions in the reports limits their usefulness. Ana Santos Rutschman, SJD, a professor of law at Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law, agrees that making this information more available would be useful. “A little more transparency would not hurt the agency,” she said. According to the BMJ report, the FDA also doesn’t inform scientific journals when sites participating in a clinical trial published in that journal receive a serious warning. In response, the FDA told The BMJ that it doesn’t monitor all publications that stem from clinical trial data submitted to the agency. Rutschman doesn’t think it is the role of the FDA, as a regulator, to notify scientific journals about problems with clinical trial sites.

Experts who spoke with The BMJ are divided on whether the FDA has the funding and other resources it needs to oversee all the research that is under its purview, both in the country and abroad. One felt that more funding and staffing would alleviate some of these problems. Another thought that the agency has sufficient funding and staffing to get the job done. According to one of the experts interviewed by The BMJ, the FDA has over 18,000 full-time employees. But Rutschman said this doesn’t mean all of these people are available to do inspections. “The FDA doesn’t just do drug regulation,” she said, “so the actual number of people they have available on the ground [to do inspections] is rather limited.” Rutschman added that there are two questions involved with these discussions about the FDA One is what will it take to change the situation, including funneling more resources to the FDA, she said, because “I think most people think the agency is underfunded.” The second is, given the FDA’s current resources, is what it is doing acceptable? “The situation right now is far from perfect,” she said, “but I think it’s on the reasonable side of things.” “The part [of The BMJ report] that I agree with is that it probably should be easier to find out what has triggered some warning from the agency,” she said.“But I don’t see how you would expect the FDA to be everywhere at the same time. It’s just not possible.”",0

594,"Living in ethnic enclaves may improve pregnancy outcomes for Asian/Pacific Islanders, NIH study suggests

Among Asian/Pacific Islander women living in the United States, those who reside in ethnic enclaves — areas with a high concentration of residents of a similar ancestry — are less likely to have pregnancy or birth complications than those living in other areas, suggests a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. The findings appear in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities.

Women in enclaves were less likely to have gestational diabetes, to deliver preterm, or to have an infant who was small for gestational age (a possible indicator of failure to grow adequately in the uterus). The researchers theorize that living in ethnic enclaves may improve health by offering easier access to health professionals of similar ancestry, access to traditional diets that are healthier than typical U.S. diets, and less incentive to engage in unhealthy habits like smoking and alcohol abuse.

“Our findings suggest that providing Asian/Pacific Islanders with culturally appropriate health care resources may be a key factor in overcoming disparities,” said the study’s senior author, Pauline Mendola, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

The U.S. Census Bureau defines “Asian” as a person having origins in the original peoples of the Far East, South East Asia or the Indian Subcontinent. Pacific Islanders have origins among the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa or other Pacific Islands.

To conduct the study, researchers analyzed data from more than 8,400 women of Asian/Pacific Islander heritage who took part in a study on labor and delivery at 19 hospitals throughout the United States. They estimated the ethnic makeup of the women’s communities from Census data and the American Community Survey from the National Historical Geographic Information System, which is supported in part by NICHD.

Compared to Asian/Pacific Islander women who lived in other areas, those who lived in ethnic enclaves were 39% less likely to develop gestational diabetes, 26% less likely to deliver preterm, and 32% less likely to have an infant small for gestational age.

The researchers noted that residents of ethnic enclaves often have stronger social networks than ethnic minorities who live elsewhere. They theorized that these social ties may ease the stress of discrimination and reduce the likelihood of resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as smoking and alcohol use. Moreover, residents of ethnic enclaves may have more access to health-relevant goods and services. For example, access to ethnic grocery stores make it possible to maintain traditional diets, which are healthier than a typical U.S. diet. Similarly, residents of ethnic enclaves may have access to health care providers of similar ancestry, who can provide culturally relevant health care information in a native language.

The authors concluded that their results suggest that improving access to culturally appropriate resources among Asian/Pacific Islander communities may improve health promotion efforts in these populations. They noted that the records they analyzed did not include information on the women’s ancestry or immigration history. For this reason, they could not detect differences in pregnancy outcomes between Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry groups.

597,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the build-up of fat in the liver due to factors other than alcohol. It affects about a quarter of the adult population globally, but its cause remains unknown. Now, researchers have linked NAFLD to gut bacteria that produce a large amount of alcohol in the body, finding these bacteria in over 60% of non-alcoholic fatty liver patients. Their findings, publishing September 19 in the journal Cell Metabolism, could help develop a screening method for early diagnosis and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver.

""We were surprised that bacteria can produce so much alcohol,"" says lead author Jing Yuan at Capital Institute of Pediatrics. ""When the body is overloaded and can't break down the alcohol produced by these bacteria, you can develop fatty liver disease even if you don't drink.""

Yuan and her team discovered the link between gut bacteria and NAFLD when they encountered a patient with severe liver damage and a rare condition called auto-brewery syndrome (ABS). Patients with ABS would become drunk after eating alcohol-free and high-sugar food. The condition has been associated with yeast infection, which can produce alcohol in the gut and lead to intoxication.

""We initially thought it was because of the yeast, but the test result for this patient was negative,"" Yuan says. ""Anti-yeast medicine also didn't work, so we suspected [his disease] might be caused by something else.""

By analyzing the patient's feces, the team found he had several strains of the bacteria Klebsiella pneumonia in his gut that produced high levels of alcohol. K. pneumonia is a common type of commensal gut bacteria. Yet, the strains isolated from the patient's gut can generate about four to six times more alcohol than strains found in healthy people.

Moreover, the team sampled the gut microbiota from 43 NAFLD patients and 48 healthy people. They found about 60% of NAFLD patients had high- and medium-alcohol-producing K. pneumonia in their gut, while only 6% of healthy controls carry these strains.

To investigate if K. pneumonia would cause fatty liver, researchers fed germ-free mice with high-alcohol-producing K. pneumonia isolated from the ABS patient for 3 months. These mice started to develop fatty liver after the first month. By 2 months, their livers showed signs of scarring, which means long-term liver damage had been made. The progression of liver disease in these mice was comparable to that of mice fed with alcohol. When the team gave bacteria-fed mice with an antibiotic that killed K. pneumonia, their condition was reversed.

""NAFLD is a heterogenous disease and may have many causes,"" Yuan says. ""Our study shows K. pneumonia is very likely to be one of them. These bacteria damage your liver just like alcohol, except you don't have a choice.""

However, it remains unknown why some people have high-alcohol-producing K. pneumonia strain in their gut while others don't.

""It's likely that these particular bacteria enter people's body via some carriers from the environment, like food,"" says co-author Di Liu at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ""But I don't think the carriers are prevalent -- otherwise we would expect much higher rate of NAFLD. Also, some people may have a gut environment that's more suitable for the growth and colonization of K. pneumonia than others because of their genetics. We don't understand what factors would make someone more susceptible to these particular K. pneumonia, and that's what we want to find out next.""

This finding could also help diagnose and treat bacteria-related NAFLD, Yuan says. Because K. pneumonia produce alcohol using sugar, patients who carry these bacteria would have a detectable amount of alcohol in their blood after drinking a simple glucose solution. ""In the early stages, fatty liver disease is reversible. If we can identify the cause sooner, we could treat and even prevent liver damage.""

""Having these bacteria in your gut means your body is exposed to alcohol constantly,"" Liu says. ""So does being a carrier mean you would have higher alcohol tolerance? I'm genuinely curious!""",0
599,"Many men with low-risk prostate cancer who most likely previously would have undergone immediate surgery or radiation are now adopting a more conservative ""active surveillance"" strategy, according to an analysis of a new federal database by scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

The use of active surveillance increased from 14.5 percent to 42.1 percent of men with low-risk prostate cancer between 2010 and 2015, said the researchers, led by Brandon Mahal, MD, from the department of radiation oncology at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center who led the study published by JAMA.

During that same period, the percentage of men undergoing radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland) declined from 47.4 percent to 31.3 percent. The use of radiotherapy for low-risk disease dropped from 38.0 percent to 26.6 percent.

""What we know from high level evidence is that conservative management of low-risk prostate cancer is associated with a very favorable prognosis,"" said Mahal. ""Many men with low-risk disease are able to be spared the toxicity of treatment so it's an important discussion to have between clinicians and patients.""

National guidelines advocating conservative management rather than immediate ""definitive treatment"" with surgery or radiotherapy were established in 2010 for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Low-risk disease is defined as a small tumor confined to the prostate gland that is assigned a grade of 6 on the Gleason scale following a biopsy; an early pathological stage, and a low PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood level.

""This encouraging finding suggests that clinicians are better adhering to current recommendations and guidelines for men with low-risk prostate cancer, as the use of active surveillance in appropriately selected men will reduce rates of overtreatment,"" said Howard Soule, PhD, executive vice president and chief science officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

Mahal said men with low-risk tumors have a ""very, very low risk of dying"" from prostate cancer, and that invasive treatments don't necessarily improve survival odds. In the current study, Mahal and his colleagues, including senior author Paul Nguyen, MD, a Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center radiation oncologist, made use of a federal database that for the first time specified whether patients made use of watchful waiting or active surveillance. (Patients adopting a watchful waiting approach are told to report symptoms such as changes in urinary habits, pain, or irritation, or bone pain that could reflect metastatic progression. Active surveillance involves periodic follow-up tests for PSA levels, repeat biopsies, and exams by a doctor every six to 12 months).

The study also revealed changes in treatment for high-risk prostate cancer from 2010 to 2015 -- though the researchers were somewhat surprised by the findings. The use of radical prostatectomy increased from 38 percent to 42.8 percent during that period, while radiotherapy decreased from 60.1 percent to 55 percent.

""This shift in management patterns away from radiation therapy and toward more radical prostatectomy is not supported by any recent high-level studies,"" said Mahal. ""This finding is provocative and may be a focal point of debate.""

606,"Jan. 10, 2023 -- Tashi Taliaferro doesn't want anyone to die alone. Having worked for more than 30 years as a nurse -- 12 of them as a hospice nurse -- Taliaferro has always felt comfortable around the sick and dying. What bothered her was the number of her patients who died without the comfort of family or friends. “We see people who are in their 80s or 90s with no family. We see veterans and the homeless and the underserved who are forgotten,” says Taliaferro, the assistant director of nursing at Advanced Nursing + Home Support, a home health care company in Rockville, MD. “We've been there with people who have had no one, and it just goes straight to my heart.” Taliaferro is in the process of opening a residential home for homeless and chronically underserved people in her community of Montgomery County, MD, outside of Washington, D.C., which has one of the highest rates of residents living in poverty in the country. Each night, more than 4,410 people in the nation's capital experience homelessness. “No one should die alone unless by choice,” Taliaferro says. “I think anyone, no matter how old or young or rich or poor or whatever their background, deserves the utmost integrity, grace, compassion, and love.” The Growing Need for End-of-Life Home As the baby boom generation ages, the number of familial caregivers will become insufficient to the task of providing that care. The AARP Policy Institute estimates that by 2030, four potential family caregivers will be available for every one person over the age of 80. That's compared to a ratio of 7 to 1 in 2010. By 2050, those numbers will fall to 3 to 1. Of course, the population of people without homes also is aging. A 2019 report from the University of Pennsylvania projects that the number of people 65 and older experiencing homelessness in the United States will nearly triple over the next 7 years, from 40,000 in 2017 to 106,000 by 2030. Homeless Americans age prematurely, the result of the chronic stress associated with living in shelters, on the streets, and couch surfing. The phenomenon is known as “weathering,” an area of particular interest for Rebecca Brown, MD, MPH, a geriatrician and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Brown's work has found that people 50 and older experiencing homelessness have similar or higher rates of geriatric conditions, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, frailty, and difficulty doing basic daily activities like bathing and dressing, than people in the general population with an average age of 80. “They get these aging-related conditions when they're younger, and then not surprisingly, they also die earlier,” Brown says. Many who have a terminal illness like cancer will continue to care for themselves in homeless shelters as long as they can, according to Travis Baggett, MD, director of research at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. “But once they can no longer get out of bed on their own or bathe themselves or need oxygen, which most shelters don't allow, they can no longer stay there,” Baggett says. These people may end up cycling between hospitals or nursing homes, where they receive medical care until they die. Taliaferro has been working with Emily Cavey, a professional photographer and end-of-life doula. Like a birth doula, Cavey provides psychological, emotional, and physical support to dying people and their families. The pair bonded after Taliaferro coordinated care for Cavey's dying loved one through her job, finding that they shared a similar desire to help people in the final stages of their lives. Taliaferro told Cavey about her idea of a residential home to empower underserved and formerly homeless people to die with dignity, and they eventually launched the Good Hearts Foundation, a nonprofit organization, to raise money for their venture. They are still in the early stages of finding a potential donor for a suitable house for the operation, as well as other sources of funds like grants to set up and run the home. For now, how the home will be licensed or permitted is unclear. Taliaferro and Cavey are also working out what kind of license they'll need to operate as a residential home; county officials in Maryland at first thought the pair would need a hospice provider license. But the home itself won't offer medical services. Residents will be able to have outside health care providers come in to deliver services, but there will be no financial ties between the residential facility and those companies.

They already have a name for the first home: Maddy's House, after Taliaferro's mother, who died in a car accident when Taliaferro was 2 years old. They hope to open in 2023. Taliaferro got her spark for Maddy's House after learning about the Omega Home Network, a membership of 40 residential homes and others in development that all serve the same purpose of providing a loving environment for people who would otherwise live alone in their last days. The Grace House, a care home in Akron, OH, and part of the network, opened in September 2022 for terminally ill people. Funded by grants and donations, the facility has three requirements for residents: They must be enrolled in a hospice program through Medicare, Medicaid, or a private insurer; they must have limited financial resources; and they can't have someone who could otherwise house and care for them. All services are free to residents. Holly Klein, a registered nurse and the founder of Grace House, routinely cared for homeless patients during her 14 years as an in-home hospice nurse in Akron. “I use the term 'home' loosely because it was really wherever the patient lived,” she says. “I met people under a bridge, in motel rooms, in homeless shelters, and some just in living conditions that were not dignified. Seeing people die alone in those conditions was a burden, and I started asking the question of, 'Isn't there more that we should be doing?'” Hospice providers – who do not have financial ties to Grace House – make regular visits to individual residents just as they would if residents had their own private homes, to manage clinical care, while the home's staff assist residents 24/7 with cooking, cleaning, personal care, and administering medication. “We think of ourselves as the surrogate family,” Klein adds. “And anything that a hospice program can teach a family to do in their home, they can teach our staff to do, such as simple dressing changes and medication education.” Since opening, 16 residents with terminal illnesses like heart disease and kidney disease have come to Grace House to live and die within its walls.

Five residents experienced homelessness before arriving, and several came from homes “that were literally falling in on them or didn't have running water, electricity, or heat,” Klein says. Residents of Grace House who lived on their own for years may enter the facility withdrawn and wary. But many forge friendships with each other, staff, and volunteers – and even reconnect with estranged loved ones in the final days and weeks of their lives. “We provide the environment where they feel safe and secure, which enables them to let down some of those walls and old habits to reconnect with people,” Klein says. “It's been amazing to see.”",0

609,"Short-term increases in inhaled steroid doses do not prevent asthma flare-ups in children

NIH-funded findings challenge common practice of increasing doses at early signs of worsening symptoms.

Researchers have found that temporarily increasing the dosage of inhaled steroids when asthma symptoms begin to worsen does not effectively prevent severe flare-ups, and may be associated with slowing a child’s growth, challenging a common medical practice involving children with mild-to-moderate asthma.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health, will appear online on March 3 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) to coincide with its presentation at a meeting of the 2018 Joint Congress of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) in Orlando, Florida. It will appear in print on March 8th.

Asthma flare-ups in children are common and costly, and to prevent them, many health professionals recommend increasing the doses of inhaled steroids from low to high at early signs of symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Until now, researchers had not rigorously tested the safety and efficacy of this strategy in children with mild-to-moderate asthma.

“These findings suggest that a short-term increase to high-dose inhaled steroids should not be routinely included in asthma treatment plans for children with mild-moderate asthma who are regularly using low-dose inhaled corticosteroids,” said study leader Daniel Jackson, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, and an expert on childhood asthma. “Low-dose inhaled steroids remain the cornerstone of daily treatment in affected children.”

The research team studied 254 children 5 to 11 years of age with mild-to-moderate asthma for nearly a year. All the children were treated with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (two puffs from an inhaler twice daily). At the earliest signs of asthma flare-up, which some children experienced multiple times throughout the year, the researchers continued giving low-dose inhaled steroids to half of the children and increased to high-dose inhaled steroids (five times the standard dose) in the other half, twice daily for seven days during each episode.

Though the children in the high-dose group had 14 percent more exposure to inhaled steroids than the low-dose group, they did not experience fewer severe flare-ups. The number of asthma symptoms, the length of time until the first severe flare-up, and the use of albuterol (a drug used as a rescue medication for asthma symptoms) were similar between the two groups. 



 Unexpectedly, the investigators found that the rate of growth of children in the short-term high-dose strategy group was about 0.23 centimeters per year less than the rate for children in the low-dose strategy group, even though the high-dose treatments were given only about two weeks per year on average. While the growth difference was small, the finding echoes previous studies showing that children who take inhaled corticosteroids for asthma may experience a small negative impact on their growth rate. More frequent or prolonged high-dose steroid use in children might increase this adverse effect, the researchers caution.

The study did not include children with asthma who do not take inhaled steroids regularly, nor did it include adults.

“This study allows caregivers to make informed decisions about how to treat their young patients with asthma,” said James Kiley, Ph.D., director of the NHLBI’s Division of Lung Diseases. “Trials like this can be used in the development of treatment guidelines for children with asthma.”

This work was supported by the following NHLBI grants: HL098102, HL098075, HL098090, HL098177, HL098098, HL098107, HL098112, HL098103, HL098115, HL098096. The NHLBI-funded study, Step Up Yellow Zone Inhaled Corticosteroids to Prevent Exacerbations (STICS) (NCT02066129), is part of the NHLBI AsthmaNet program, a nationwide clinical research network that explores new approaches in treating asthma from childhood to adulthood.

615,"A diagnostic test capable of accurately and reliably detecting the microorganism that causes gonorrhea and rapidly determining in under 30 minutes if the microorganism is susceptible to a single-dose antibiotic is the winner of the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Diagnostic Challenge. Visby Medical, Inc., will receive $19 million as a prize for its winning diagnostic.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. The AMR Diagnostic Challenge is co-sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, with each contributing $10 million over the course of the competition.

“Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a growing and concerning public health risk against which we have few effective deterrents,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “Challenge prizes spur innovation and we saw many innovative concepts throughout this competition. I want to congratulate Visby Medical for their winning technology, which could help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, a major driver of antimicrobial resistance.”

“One of the challenges healthcare providers face in combating the growing threat of antimicrobial resistant infections is identifying which drugs will be effective in treating the initial infection, and fixing that problem starts with rapid, accurate, easy-to-use, point of care diagnostics,” said BARDA Acting Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “Innovative technologies that can rapidly detect and diagnose drug resistant infections have the potential to measurably improve our response in a public health emergency caused by a drug resistant pathogen. Congratulations to Visby Medical on their winning technology.”

The company’s diagnostic, known as Patient-side, Disposable, Molecular PCR Diagnostic Device for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Drug Resistance Markers, is a palm-size, single-use, disposable device for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae), the microorganism that causes gonorrhea. This diagnostic gives results quickly, allowing clinicians to treat patients immediately and with the correct medication. Gonorrhea is one of the most frequently seen sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which represent a major public health crisis worldwide and in the United States. There were more than 580,000 cases of gonorrhea reported nationwide in 2018 according to the CDC, a 63% increase from 2014.

This type of rapid testing that includes assessment of antibiotic susceptibility has not been available previously as a point-of-care diagnostic device. Antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhea is of increasing concern, and successful treatment of gonorrhea is becoming more difficult. Treatment options have been limited to two drugs, requiring an injection of one drug plus an oral antibiotic.

If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Visby Medical device could be useful in ensuring that patients with gonorrhea receive the right antibiotic so that they can immediately begin treatment, and will allow other antibiotics to be used for patients with drug resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae.

The easy-to-use format of the device could be helpful in STI clinics, walk-in/urgent care clinics and other facilities without extensive hands-on laboratory staff. Ultimately, this device could have a significant impact in addressing the increasing incidence of gonorrhea and the increasing spread of drug resistant forms of this common STI in the United States and worldwide. Visby Medical currently is exploring how its proprietary technology platform could be adapted to aid in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The winning diagnostic was chosen from a group of five semifinalists who each received $100,000 in Step 2 of the competition to develop and test prototypes to improve detection of drug-resistant bacteria or differentiate between a bacterial and viral infection.

616,"Obesity during pregnancy may lead directly to fetal overgrowth, NIH study suggests

Obesity during pregnancy — independent of its health consequences such as diabetes — may account for the higher risk of giving birth to an atypically large infant, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health. Their study appears in JAMA Pediatrics.

“Our results underscore the importance of attaining a healthy body weight before pregnancy,” said the study’s lead author, Cuilin Zhang, M.D., Ph.D., a researcher in the Division of Intramural Population Health Research at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “They also suggest that clinicians should carefully monitor the pregnancies of all obese women, regardless of whether or not they have obesity-related health conditions.”

Macrosomia — large body size at birth — is common among children born to obese women, particularly those who have gestational diabetes (high blood sugar during pregnancy). Macrosomia increases the risk that an infant will experience bone fracture during delivery. It also increases the likelihood that the infant will need to be delivered by cesarean section. Having a large infant also increases a mother’s risk for postpartum hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding at birth.

In the current study, researchers analyzed ultrasound scans taken throughout pregnancy of more than 2,800 pregnant women: 443 obese women with no accompanying health conditions, such as diabetes, and more than 2300 non-obese women. The researchers categorized the women’s weight according to their body mass index (BMI) score. Women with a BMI ranging from 30 to 44.9 were classified as obese, while those with a BMI of 29.9 were considered non-obese.

Beginning in the 21st week of pregnancy, ultrasound scans revealed that for fetuses of obese women, the femur (thigh bone) and humerus (upper arm bone) were longer than those of the fetuses of non-obese women. The differences between fetuses of obese and non-obese women continued through the 38th week of pregnancy. For fetuses in the obese group, the average femur length was 0.8 millimeters longer (about 0.03 inches), compared to the non-obese group, and humerus length was about 1.1 millimeters longer (about 0.04 inches), compared to the non-obese group. Average birth weight was about 100 grams (about 0.2 pounds) heavier in the obese group. Moreover, infants born to obese women were more likely to be classified as large for gestational age (birth weight above the 90th percentile), compared to infants born to non-obese women.

The study could not determine exactly why the fetuses of obese women were larger and heavier than fetuses in the non-obese group. The researchers theorize that because obese women are more likely to have insulin resistance (difficulty using insulin to lower blood sugar), higher blood sugar levels could have promoted overgrowth in their fetuses.

The authors pointed out that earlier studies have indicated that the higher risk of overgrowth seen in newborns of obese women may predispose these infants to obesity and cardiovascular disease later in life. They called for additional studies to follow the children born to obese women to determine what health issues they may face.

Approximately 90% of insulin sold in the United States is manufactured by one of three companies (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi). The rising cost of insulin in the United States can be attributed primarily to two phenomena. First, U.S. law allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to price their products at whatever level they believe the market will bear and to raise prices over time without limit. Second, direct competition in the insulin market is lacking. The most effective form of price competition for prescription drugs in the United States comes from interchangeable generic drugs made by manufacturers independent of the brand-name drug's supplier. But such products have been blocked from entering the insulin market because many current insulin products are protected by recently obtained patents covering aspects of the drug's formulation or its delivery device. Insulin manufacturers have recently begun marketing 'generic' versions of their brand-name products, also known as authorized generics. Although the list price of these products is less than that of their brand-name equivalents, it remains unclear whether authorized generics will provide meaningful cost savings to patients.

621,"Serious complications from youth-onset type 2 diabetes arise by young adulthood

People with type 2 diabetes diagnosed during youth have a high risk of developing complications at early ages and have a greater chance of multiple complications within 15 years after diagnosis. The findings are the culmination of a first-of-its-kind trial funded largely by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Within 15 years of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, 60% of participants had at least one diabetes-related complication, and nearly a third of participants had two or more complications, according to results of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) follow-up study, called TODAY2. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“The original TODAY study showed that youth-onset type 2 diabetes is distinct from adult-onset diabetes – it is both more aggressive and more difficult to control,” said Dr. Barbara Linder, NIDDK project scientist for TODAY. “By following this unique disease course, TODAY2 shows the devastating complications that can develop in what should be the prime of these young people’s lives.”

TODAY2 involved 500 original participants from the TODAY study, which began in 2004. TODAY was the first major comparative effectiveness trial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth. The study compared three treatments for managing blood glucose: metformin alone, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention. Metformin is the only oral medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat type 2 diabetes in youth.

At the time of enrollment, participants were between the ages of 10-17, had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for fewer than two years, and were overweight or had obesity. The average age of participants after the TODAY2 follow-up was 26 years.

Participants in TODAY2 were monitored annually for signs of diabetes complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, diabetic foot complications, and to report other health events. Diabetic eye disease was assessed once during the study, at the seven-year study visit.

Overall, researchers saw a steady decline in blood glucose control over 15 years. In addition,
• nearly 52% had dyslipidemia, or high fat levels in the blood

Rates did not differ based on the original TODAY study treatment group assignment.

In addition, certain participants had a higher likelihood to develop multiple complications over time, with 28% developing two or more over the follow-up period. Participants who belonged to a minority racial or ethnic group, or who had high blood glucose, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia were at higher risk for developing a complication.

“Compared to what we see in adults with type 2 diabetes, the participants in TODAY2 developed complications much earlier in their disease course and at a much faster pace over time,” said TODAY2 study chair Dr. Philip Zeitler, professor of pediatrics-endocrinology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “This study shows the importance of treating youth-onset type 2 diabetes intensively from the beginning and using all available approaches to control blood glucose and prevent, delay, or aggressively treat developing complications.”

The TODAY study’s diverse cohort is representative of the U.S. youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Study participants had regular, intensive diabetes management through the study at no cost during the original TODAY trial, which researchers note may have actually lowered the rate of complications.

“TODAY and TODAY2 have been instrumental in understanding and treating type 2 diabetes in youth,” said NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers. “In addition to finding better prevention methods, discovering new and better treatment options to manage type 2 diabetes in youth will be key to ensuring their healthy futures.”

The TODAY and TODAY2 studies were conducted at 15 centers in the U.S. and The George Washington University, Washington, D.C., served as the data coordinating center.

This work was completed with funding from NIDDK/NIH grant numbers U01-DK61212, U01-DK61230, U01-DK61239, U01-DK61242, and U01-DK61254; the National Center for Research Resources General Clinical Research Centers Program; and the NCRR Clinical and Translational Science Award Program.

623,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — CEOs from nine Minnesota health systems have come together in an appeal to the public, asking them to help our state’s overwhelmed health care system. As COVID-19 continues to surge, leaders have taken out a full-page ad in major newspapers across the state this week that highlight the critical nature of the situation, the heartbreaking realities facing hospitals and how the community can help.

Almost two years into this pandemic, Minnesota health care is in one of the most difficult positions it has been in since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in our state. Doctors, nurses and people working in health care are doing everything they can to support the health of all Minnesotans. And yet, every day our health care workers see avoidable illness and death as a direct result of COVID-19. Health systems have risen to every challenge put before them, but they are overwhelmed and cannot continue to carry this burden.

Collaboration between Minnesota’s health care systems has always been an important part of serving the community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the level of teamwork, support and cooperation is higher than ever. The CEOs are asking everyone to step up and do their part to stop the continued spread of COVID-19:
• Get vaccinated + get your booster
• If you feel sick, get tested for COVID-19
• Encourage neighbors and loved ones to take these steps

624,"Low levels of circulating vitamin K are linked to increased risk of mobility limitation and disability in older adults, identifying a new factor to consider for maintaining mobility and independence in older age, according to a study led by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.

The study, published online in May in advance of print in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, is the first to evaluate the association between biomarkers of vitamin K status and the onset of mobility limitation and disability in older adults.

""Because of our growing population of older people, it's important for us to understand the variety of risk factors for mobility disability,"" said Kyla Shea, first and corresponding author and a nutrition scientist in the Vitamin K Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University.

""Low vitamin K status has been associated with the onset of chronic diseases that lead to disability, but the work to understand this connection is in its infancy. Here, we're building on previous studies that found that low levels of circulating vitamin K are associated with slower gait speed and a higher risk of osteoarthritis,"" she continued.

The new study examined two biomarkers: circulating levels of vitamin K (phylloquinone) and a functional measure of vitamin K (plasma ucMGP). Using participant data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC), the study found that older adults with low levels of circulating vitamin K were more likely to develop mobility limitation and disability. The other biomarker, plasma ucMGP, did not show clear associations with mobility limitation and disability.

Specifically, older adults with low circulating vitamin K levels were nearly 1.5 times more likely to develop mobility limitation and nearly twice as likely to develop mobility disability compared to those with sufficient levels. This was true for both men and women.

""The connection we saw with low levels of circulating vitamin K further supports vitamin K's association with mobility disability,"" said senior author Sarah Booth, a vitamin K and nutrition researcher, and director of the HNRCA. ""Although the two biomarkers we looked at are known to reflect vitamin K status, biomarker levels can also be affected by additional known or unknown factors. Further experiments to understand the mechanisms of biomarkers and vitamin K and their role in mobility are needed.""

The study used data from 635 men and 688 women ages 70-79 years old, approximately 40 percent of whom were black, who participated in Health ABC. In Health ABC, mobility was assessed every six months for six to ten years through annual clinic visits and phone interviews in the intervening time. For the present analysis, the researchers defined mobility limitation as two consecutive semi-annual reports of having any amount of difficulty either with walking a quarter of a mile or climbing 10 steps without resting, and mobility disability as two consecutive semi-annual reports of having a lot of difficulty or inability to walk or climb the same amount.

Circulating vitamin K levels reflect the amount of vitamin K in the diet. The best food sources of vitamin K include leafy greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli and some dairy products. For an average adult, one cup of raw spinach provides 145 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin K1, or 181 percent of the Daily Value; one cup of raw kale provides 113 mcg, or 141 percent; and half of a cup of chopped boiled broccoli provides 110 mcg, or 138 percent.",0
625,"Innovative network for advancing development of new treatments will continue for five more years.

The Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials, or NeuroNEXT, a research program that helps streamline Phase II clinical trials for brain disorders, has been renewed for five more years, with several new centers joining the program. NeuroNEXT is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“One of the advantages of NeuroNEXT, and something that makes it unique, is the network’s ability to quickly mobilize a group of specialists from a certain disease area to initiate a clinical study when opportunities emerge for trials,” said Robin Conwit, M.D., program director at NINDS. “The structure of NeuroNEXT, with its broad focus across neuroscience clinical studies, has the potential to reach many individuals who are affected by brain disorders.”

NeuroNEXT was started in 2011 to make neuroscience clinical trials more efficient and to help increase the number of treatments that get into clinical practice. The program is designed to encourage collaborations between academic centers, disease foundations, and industry. If a researcher is considering a Phase II clinical study, but does not have the experience to conduct it, he or she can apply to the NeuroNEXT program to leverage the resources that are available at the participating centers. For example, NeuroNEXT centers can provide equipment, standardize data acquisition and analysis, or help with patient recruitment. In addition, since each study takes place simultaneously in several different clinical centers, it takes less time to enroll the targeted number of patients than would be the case with a single center study.

“To date, nine clinical trials currently in various stages have been implemented in the NeuroNEXT network, showing that this innovative approach to research can help expedite clinical research and help get treatments to patients faster,” said Codrin Lungu, M.D., NINDS program director. “We are thrilled to continue working with the sites that have been participating in the network, and we look forward to collaborating with the eight sites that will be joining the program.”

The NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.

626,"People who suffer from insomnia were 69% more likely to have a heart attack compared to those who didn't have the sleep disorder during an average nine years of follow-up, according to new research being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session Together With the World Congress of Cardiology. In addition, when looking at sleep duration as an objective measure of insomnia, researchers found that people who clocked five or fewer hours of sleep a night had the greatest risk of experiencing a heart attack. People with both diabetes and insomnia had a twofold likelihood of having a heart attack.

""Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, but in many ways it's no longer just an illness, it's more of a life choice. We just don't prioritize sleep as much as we should,"" said Yomna E. Dean, a medical student at Alexandria University in Alexandria, Egypt, and author of the study. ""Our study showed that people with insomnia are more likely to have a heart attack regardless of age, and heart attacks occurred more often in women with insomnia.""

Dean and her research team are hopeful that the current study will help draw attention to the role that sleep disorders may play in heart health. Insomnia may include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or getting good quality sleep. Growing in prevalence, insomnia is estimated to affect 10% to 30% of American adults, affecting women more than men. While studies have linked insomnia to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, this analysis is the largest to date.

""Based on our pooled data, insomnia should be considered a risk factor for developing a heart attack, and we need to do a better job of educating people about how dangerous [lack of good sleep] can be,"" Dean said.

For their analysis, the researchers conducted a systematic review of the literature that yielded 1,226 studies -- of these, nine studies originating from the U.S., United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, Taiwan and China were selected for inclusion. All told, data for 1,184,256 adults (43% of whom were women) were assessed. The average age was 52 years and 13% (153,881) had insomnia, which was defined based on ICD diagnostic codes or by the presence of any of these three symptoms: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep or waking early and not being able to get back to sleep. People with obstructive sleep apnea were not included. Most patients (96%) did not have a prior history of heart attack. Heart attacks occurred in 2,406 of those who had insomnia and 12,398 of those in the non-insomnia group.

Based on the pooled data, there was a statistically significant association between insomnia and having a heart attack after controlling for other factors that could make a heart attack more likely such as age, gender, comorbidities and smoking. This association between insomnia and heart attack remained significant across all subgroups of patients, including younger and older age (<65 and >65), follow-up duration (more or less than five years), male and female sex, and common comorbidities (diabetes, high blood pressure or cholesterol).

""Not surprisingly, people with insomnia who also had high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes had an even higher risk of having a heart attack than those who didn't,"" Dean said. ""People with diabetes who also have insomnia had a twofold likelihood of having a heart attack.""

Moreover, people who reported five or less hours of sleep a night were 1.38 and 1.56 times more likely to experience a heart attack compared with those who slept six and seven to eight hours a night, respectively. There was no difference in the risk of heart attack between those getting five or less or nine or more hours of sleep a night, Dean said, which supports findings from previous studies that have shown that getting too little or too much sleep can be harmful to heart health. Dean and her team found that patients who slept six hours had a lower risk of heart attack compared with those who slept nine hours.

In a separate analysis, the researchers sought to determine whether individual insomnia symptoms are associated with a higher risk of heart attack. Disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep -- that is, trouble falling or staying asleep -- were also tied to a 13% increased likelihood of heart attack compared with people without these symptoms.

Non-restorative sleep and daytime dysfunction, however, were not associated with heart attack, suggesting that those who only complain of feeling unrefreshed upon waking up without any lack of sleep aren't at an increased risk of heart attacks, Dean said.

Based on the findings, Dean said it is important that people prioritize sleep so they get seven to eight hours of quality sleep a night.

""Practice good sleep hygiene; the room should be dark, quiet and on the cooler side, and put away devices. Do something that is calming to wind down, and if you have tried all these things and still can't sleep or are sleeping less than five hours, talk with your doctor.""

The study had some limitations, including that most of the studies assessed relied on participants self-reporting on sleep behaviors using questionnaires, although heart attacks were validated by medical reports.",0

CNN reported that health officials are optimistic about the effectiveness of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine – and the possibility of eliminating the current outbreak in the country.

“We are cautiously optimistic about the study and think if we continue to get vaccines out to those that are at highest risk for disease, and if we continue to promote the behavioral changes that we know work, that the combination of those two will allow us to continue to see decreases in cases and hopefully eliminate the current monkeypox outbreak in the United States,” one senior health official told CNN.",0
629,"A recent study shows that kids who were exposed to cannabis in the womb were more likely to be at risk for obesity and high blood sugar. Valentina Barreto/Stocksy United
• A new study found that children exposed to cannabis in utero may be at higher risk for certain health issues as they age.
• These children were at higher risk for having obesity and high blood sugar.
• This study adds to a growing amount of evidence linking cannabis use during pregnancy to a variety of developmental and health issues in children. Children who were exposed to cannabis in utero may be at risk for obesity and high blood sugar later in life, according to new research. The study, which was published Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, measured cannabis levels in over 100 pregnant women and evaluated the health of their children around five years of age. Of the children involved in the study, those who had been exposed to cannabis in the womb had a 2.6 percent greater fat mass and higher fasting glucose levels compared to those who weren’t exposed to cannabis in the womb. The study adds to the growing evidence suggesting cannabis use in pregnancy may affect a baby’s health and interfere with their development. “I am not surprised that prenatal exposure to cannabis has [an] impact on the offspring. In principle, any significant pharmacological intervention (and cannabis is surely one) may impact the newborn either directly (by affecting the fetus) or indirectly (by affecting first the mother and then the fetus),” Dr. Daniele Piomelli, the director of the University of California Irvine Center for the Study of Cannabis, told Healthline.

Fetal cannabis exposure is linked to low birth weight and obesity in childhood The study looked at 103 mother-child pairs living in Colorado. The researchers collected urine samples from the pregnant women and found that 15 percent had detectable levels of cannabinoids, including THC and CBD, in their bodies, which suggests the fetuses had been exposed to the cannabinoids. A follow-up visit was scheduled when the children were nearly five years old, at which point the children underwent blood draws after an overnight fast. The children’s fat mass was also measured. The kids who had been exposed to cannabis in the womb were more likely to be at risk for obesity and high blood sugar. It’s unclear why fetal exposure to cannabis could have had this effect. Piomelli says cannabis could interfere with the fetus’s endogenous cannabinoid system or cannabis may impact the mother’s behavior and physiology, altering the baby’s development.

What we know about cannabis use in pregnancy Cannabis use among has been increasing in the United States as more states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis, although overall rates remain very low. From 2002 to 2017, of cannabis during pregnancy jumped from 3.4 percent of pregnant women to 7 percent. Previous research has linked maternal cannabis use to negative health outcomes in the baby. Fetuses exposed to cannabis are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome later in life. Development and behavioral issues — including visual problem-solving challenges and decreased attention span — have been recorded in kids exposed to cannabis in utero as well. Babies of active cannabis users are more likely to have intrauterine growth problems and low birth weight. “If cannabis is smoked frequently, this may cause lower oxygen levels in the bloodstream which in turn might perturb growth,” Piomelli said, adding that we do not know if this applies to other forms of cannabis use like vaping or edibles. According to Dr. S. Monty Ghosh, an assistant professor and doctor of internal medicine, disaster medicine, and addiction medicine at the University of Alberta, these findings mirror the impact of during pregnancy. “It would be interesting [to] explore if this was related to smoking cannabis or ingested cannabis,” Ghosh said.",0

Details of the clinical study and its findings were just published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Trial participants using the artificial pancreas spent approximately three more hours per day in their target blood sugar range compared with participants in a control group who continued relying on the methods they were already using to manage their blood sugar.

The Control-IQ system, manufactured by Tandem Diabetes Care, is a diabetes management device thatautomatically monitors and regulates blood glucose. The artificial pancreas has an insulin pump that uses advanced control algorithms based on the person's glucose-monitoring information to adjust the insulin dose as needed.

Based on findings from two earlier studies, the system has previously been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people ages 6 and older with type 1 diabetes.

""After the resounding success of Control-IQ technology in people ages 6 and up, it is very rewarding to see our youngest patients, and often the most challenging patients to help, benefit as well,"" said Marc D. Breton, PhD, a UVA School of Medicine researcher who served as the trial's principal investigator and was recently honored as UVA's 2022 Innovator of the Year. ""With these results, we have now accumulated years of clinical validation of this system across all age groups and look forward to seeing this life-changing technology made available to the broadest possible population.""

The study enrolled 102 children between ages 2 and 6 at three U.S. sites (UVA, Stanford University and the University of Colorado) and randomly assigned 68 of them to use the artificial pancreas system for 13 weeks, while the remaining 34 children were assigned to the control group. All participants maintained their regular daily routines during the study.

On average, the time participants using the artificial pancreas spent within their target blood glucose range was about 12 percentage points higher than participants in the control group overall and 18 percentage points higher during the overnight hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Nighttime blood glucose control is particularly important, as severe, unchecked hypoglycemia (very low blood glucose levels) can lead to seizures, coma or even death.

Overall, the researchers found, participants were able to use the artificial pancreas safely. There were two cases of severe hypoglycemia in the artificial pancreas group, compared with one in the control group. There was also one case of diabetic ketoacidosis in the artificial pancreas group, caused by a failure of the thin plastic tube that connects the insulin pump to the patient's body.

Of note, most of the study-related visits -- including 80% of the training sessions on the artificial pancreas and more than 90% of the overall visits -- were conducted virtually. Achieving the reported results under these conditions highlights the ease of use of the technology and its potential for areas without easy access to endocrinologists.

""At the end of the day, this technology significantly improved glycemia and ensured safety of our youngest patients, but perhaps just as importantly it lessened these families' constant anxiety about glucose levels, especially during the night."" Breton said. ""It is incredibly rewarding for us to hear about these families' experiences and how they manage to integrate these new tools in their life, offering some reprieve to the challenges they face.""

634,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the human microbiome -- the collection of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live on and within us -- significantly contributes to our health. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated the contribution of the microbiome to regulating immune cells that influence bone health.

To find out more, researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) who study osteoimmunology, the interface of the skeletal and immune systems, have examined the impact of the oral microbiome on alveolar bone. The alveolar bone, commonly known as the jaw bone, is a unique bone tissue that houses and supports our teeth. Their results, published online on Jan. 25 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight, showed that healthy microbes in the mouth activated a subset of immune cells within the alveolar bone marrow, which in turn promoted osteoclastic cells that are responsible for breaking down bone. They went on to show that depleting the healthy oral microbiome, using an antiseptic mouthwash, protected against this bone loss in preclinical models, demonstrating a direct link between microbes in the mouth and naturally occuring alveolar bone loss.

""The alveolar bone is different from other bone tissues due to its role in supporting the teeth,"" said Chad M. Novince, D.D.S., Ph.D., associate professor in the colleges of Medicine and Dental Medicine, who studies the impact of the microbiome on osteoimmunology and skeletal metabolism. ""What is most fascinating to me is that we were able to show that the commensal oral microbiota modulates the communication between immune cells and bone cells, separate from other microbiota communities, that impact alveolar bone health.""

""I think this is really only the start to understanding how the commensal oral microbiome can regulate alveolar bone health and homeostasis,"" added Jessica D. Hathaway-Schrader, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in the College of Dental Medicine and first author on this study.

Previously, the Novince lab utilized mouse models with a defined microbiota and showed that specific commensal microbes in the gut could influence normal skeletal development and homeostasis. In the current study, they focused on the oral cavity -- a unique space in which the microbes colonizing the mouth are in close proximity to the underlying alveolar bone. Little was known about how interactions between microbes and immune cells in the oral cavity, compared with other anatomic sites, influence alveolar bone health.

In order to understand the interplay between microbes and immune cells within the oral cavity more fully, the Novince lab pioneered two new techniques. The first technique involved innovatively collecting bone marrow from the mandible of mice, which enabled the researchers to perform in-depth studies on immune cells within alveolar bone. The second technique involved developing a novel way to deplete microbes from the oral cavity of mice. The team utilized a unique delivery sponge loaded with chlorhexidine, an antiseptic used to treat gingivitis, to perform oral rinses on the mice.

With these innovations in hand, the team used the chlorohexidine rinse to deplete the commensal oral microbiota. Suppressing the commensal microbial load in the oral cavity, while not altering the commensal microbiota at other sites, dampened the immune response in the alveolar bone marrow. This dampened immune response suppressed bone resorbing osteoclast cells, which had an overall protective effect on alveolar bone loss that naturally occurs due to the burden of commensal microbes.

Analysis of the bone marrow within the mandibles of mice revealed that a subset of immune cells were activated by the presence of commensal oral microbes. One important class of activated immune cells were dendritic cells. These cells act like sentinals of the immune system and alert other immune cells that microbial invaders are present. The other important immune cells that were activated by the presence of commensal oral microbes were CD4+ helper T-cells. These cells help to coordinate the immune response during an infection. Ultimately, these immune cells supported osteoclasts.

Together, these data suggest a tightly coordinated pathway in which commensal oral microbes influence alveolar bone health. Furthermore, reducing the burden of commensal microbes in the mouth through oral antiseptic rinses prevented alveolar bone loss, which could have important clinical implications moving forward.

""We were able to show that the commensal oral microbiota influences alveolar bone homeostasis through osteoimmune mechanisms that are distinct from the systemic microbiome,"" said Novince. ""If we are able to suppress the healthy oral microbiome to lower levels, it could help protect from alveolar bone loss, even in a state of health.""

This report is the first investigation showing that chlorhexidine reduces naturally occurring alveolar bone loss and suggests that antiseptic oral rinses could support alveolar bone health and homeostasis. To ensure that this potential treatment is safe and effective, future studies aimed at better describing the interaction between the microbiome, immune cells and bone is warranted.

""Although we're broadly suppressing oral microorganisms with the antiseptic rinse, it will be important to determine which specific microbes are really driving this naturally occurring alveolar bone loss,"" said Hathaway-Schrader. ""The alveolar bone marrow is a unique environment, and this is the first step in understanding interactions between oral microbes and immune cells important for promoting bone health.""",0

636,"Cleveland Clinic and its Community Partners to Help Provide Affordable Broadband to Cleveland Neighborhood Cleveland is America’s least connected city; partnership is an effort to close the digital divide

Cleveland Clinic, DigitalC and two Cleveland businesses, TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) and The Lubrizol Foundation, are coming together to help provide affordable high-speed internet to residents of the Fairfax neighborhood in Cleveland. The effort aims to help impact disparities in internet coverage in the local community, which can affect access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities. According to 2019 Census Bureau data, Cleveland is the worst-connected large city, with nearly 50,000 households not having reliable broadband.

Particularly in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic, access to internet affects a person’s ability to search and apply for jobs, utilize healthcare and telehealth services, fully participate in their education and virtually connect with friends, family and colleagues.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has further illuminated the crucial role internet access plays in the overall health and well-being a population, and it is critical that we work to overcome digital inequities,” said Dr. Tom Mihaljevic, President and CEO of Cleveland Clinic. “Cleveland Clinic is proud to be part of this initiative and to have partners who will help support our community to deliver the tools, resources and services needed to foster growth and education for our closest neighbors for years to come.”

Broadband for the households covered in this program will be provided by EmpowerCLE, a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) founded by and operating within DigitalC. DigitalC is a nonprofit organization focused on improving Cleveland’s digital equity and providing residents with an affordable, high-speed internet connection. EmpowerCLE has installed equipment on the rooftops of two Cleveland Clinic main campus buildings in order to expand its coverage in the Fairfax community. EmpowerCLE Brand Ambassadors and technicians will visit local households to offer the connection and install the necessary equipment to begin service.

While DigitalC and EmpowerCLE provide affordable internet services, in order to further lower the cost for Fairfax residents, Cleveland Clinic has brought together additional partners with an interest in connecting underserved areas. In addition, TransDigm and The Lubrizol Foundation have agreed to contribute significant funds to further reduce the monthly subscription fee and help subsidize the cost of equipment.

In addition to working with DigitalC, earlier this year, Cleveland Clinic signed on to the American Connection Project Broadband Coalition, which advocates to bring high speed internet to rural and under-connected areas. Connecting underserved areas with reliable high-speed internet is one way Cleveland Clinic aims to positively impact social determinants of health in our communities. Social determinants of health are factors such as food security, housing, infant mortality, chronic diseases, education quality and access and economic opportunity which affect a person’s health and wellbeing. According to the National Academy of Medicine, medical care is estimated to account for only 20% of a person’s health — social determinants of health can make up the other 80%.

“Social determinants of health lay the foundation of a person’s overall health and have a lifelong impact on their health outcomes,” said Adam Myers, M.D., Cleveland Clinic’s Chief of Population Health. “By identifying areas we can help, such as providing broadband

connection, and engaging with like-minded partners, we can make a difference in creating a better, healthier community for everyone.”

Installation should be complete for Fairfax residents by the second quarter of 2021.",0
638,"Treating preterm infants with antibiotics for more than 20 months appears to promote the development of multidrug-resistant gut bacteria, suggests a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. The research appears in Nature Microbiology.

Researchers used high-speed DNA sequencing and advanced computational analysis to study stool samples from 32 infants born very preterm who received antibiotic treatment for 21 months (in the neonatal intensive care unit and after discharge), nine infants born very preterm who received antibiotics for less than a week, and 17 healthy term and late preterm infants who hadn’t received antibiotics. Infants who received prolonged antibiotic treatment had less diverse bacterial populations in their gut, compared to the other infants, and these bacteria contained more antibiotic resistance genes.

Moreover, the genomes of the high antibiotic use group contained genes for resistance to antibiotics typically not given to newborns, such as ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. One possible explanation is that these genes might originate in multidrug-resistant bacteria, so using a particular antibiotic may trigger resistance to other antibiotics, even if they were not used.

The researchers do not know the long-term effects of these genome changes, which they term “microbiota scars.” They note that previous studies linked antibiotic treatment during infancy with allergies, psoriasis, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease later in life. Their findings raise the possibility that early-life antibiotic use may promote these effects by reducing the diversity of microbial communities in the gut, encouraging the growth of injurious bacterial species and perhaps also suppressing the growth of beneficial microbes.

The study received funding from NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

649,"Most deaths from melanoma -- the most lethal form of skin cancer -- occur in patients who were initially diagnosed with early-stage melanoma and then later experienced a recurrence that is typically not detected until it has spread or metastasized.

A team led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) recently developed an artificial intelligence-based method to predict which patients are most likely to experience a recurrence and are therefore expected to benefit from aggressive treatment. The method was validated in a study published in npj Precision Oncology.

Most patients with early-stage melanoma are treated with surgery to remove cancerous cells, but patients with more advanced cancer often receive immune checkpoint inhibitors, which effectively strengthen the immune response against tumor cells but also carry significant side effects.

""There is an urgent need to develop predictive tools to assist in the selection of high-risk patients for whom the benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors would justify the high rate of morbid and potentially fatal immunologic adverse events observed with this therapeutic class,"" says senior author Yevgeniy R. Semenov, MD, an investigator in the Department of Dermatology at MGH.

""Reliable prediction of melanoma recurrence can enable more precise treatment selection for immunotherapy, reduce progression to metastatic disease and improve melanoma survival while minimizing exposure to treatment toxicities.""

To help achieve this, Semenov and his colleagues assessed the effectiveness of algorithms based on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that used data from patient electronic health records to predict melanoma recurrence.

Specifically, the team collected 1,720 early-stage melanomas -- 1,172 from the Mass General Brigham healthcare system (MGB) and 548 from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) -- and extracted 36 clinical and pathologic features of these cancers from electronic health records to predict patients' recurrence risk with machine learning algorithms. Algorithms were developed and validated with various MGB and DFCI patient sets, and tumor thickness and rate of cancer cell division were identified as the most predictive features.

""Our comprehensive risk prediction platform using novel machine learning approaches to determine the risk of early-stage melanoma recurrence reached high levels of classification and time to event prediction accuracy,"" says Semenov. ""Our results suggest that machine learning algorithms can extract predictive signals from clinicopathologic features for early-stage melanoma recurrence prediction, which will enable the identification of patients who may benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy.""

653,"A new advanced computing technique using routine medical scans to enable doctors to take fewer, more accurate tumour biopsies, has been developed by cancer researchers at the University of Cambridge.

This is an important step towards precision tissue sampling for cancer patients to help select the best treatment. In future the technique could even replace clinical biopsies with 'virtual biopsies', sparing patients invasive procedures.

The research published in European Radiology shows that combining computed tomography (CT) scans with ultrasound images creates a visual guide for doctors to ensure they sample the full complexity of a tumour with fewer targeted biopsies.

Capturing the patchwork of different types of cancer cell within a tumour -- known as tumour heterogeneity -- is critical for selecting the best treatment because genetically-different cells may respond differently to treatment.

Most cancer patients undergo one or several biopsies to confirm diagnosis and plan their treatment. But because this is an invasive clinical procedure, there is an urgent need to reduce the number of biopsies taken and to make sure biopsies accurately sample the genetically-different cells in the tumour, particularly for ovarian cancer patients.

High grade serous ovarian (HGSO) cancer, the most common type of ovarian cancer, is referred to as a 'silent killer' because early symptoms can be difficult to pick up. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, it is often at an advanced stage, and survival rates have not changed much over the last 20 years.

But late diagnosis isn't the only problem. HGSO tumours tend to have a high level of tumour heterogeneity and patients with more genetically-different patches of cancer cells tend to have a poorer response to treatment.

Professor Evis Sala from the Department of Radiology, co-lead CRUK Cambridge Centre Advanced Cancer Imaging Programme, leads a multi-disciplinary team of radiologists, physicists, oncologists and computational scientists using innovative computing techniques to reveal tumour heterogeneity from standard medical images. This new study, led by Professor Sala, involved a small group of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who were due to have ultrasound-guided biopsies prior to starting chemotherapy.

For the study, the patients first had a standard-of-care CT scan. A CT scanner uses x-rays and computing to create a 3D image of the tumour from multiple image 'slices' through the body.

The researchers then used a process called radiomics -- using high-powered computing methods to analyse and extract additional information from the data-rich images created by the CT scanner -- to identify and map distinct areas and features of the tumour. The tumour map was then superimposed on the ultrasound image of the tumour and the combined image used to guide the biopsy procedure.

By taking targeted biopsies using this method, the research team reported that the diversity of cancer cells within the tumour was successfully captured.

Co-first author Dr Lucian Beer, from the Department of Radiology and CRUK Cambridge Centre Ovarian Cancer Programme, said of the results: ""Our study is a step forward to non-invasively unravel tumour heterogeneity by using standard-of-care CT-based radiomic tumour habitats for ultrasound-guided targeted biopsies.""

Co-first author Paula Martin-Gonzalez, from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and CRUK Cambridge Centre Ovarian Cancer Programme, added: ""We will now be applying this method in a larger clinical study.""

Professor Sala said: ""This study provides an important milestone towards precision tissue sampling. We are truly pushing the boundaries in translating cutting edge research to routine clinical care.""

Fiona Barve (56) is a science teacher who lives near Cambridge. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2017 after visiting her doctor with abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer and immediately underwent surgery and a course of chemotherapy. Since March 2019 she has been cancer free and is now back to teaching three days a week.

""I was diagnosed at a late stage and I was fortunate my surgery, which I received within four weeks of being diagnosed, and chemotherapy worked for me. I feel lucky to be around,"" said Barve.

""When you are first undergoing the diagnosis of cancer, you feel as if you are on a conveyor belt, every part of the journey being extremely stressful. This new enhanced technique will reduce the need for several procedures and allow patients more time to adjust to their circumstances. It will enable more accurate diagnosis with less invasion of the body and mind. This can only be seen as positive progress.""",0
658,"Treatments involving noninvasive low intensity electric or magnetic impulses may eventually help people give up harmful, addictive behaviors such as smoking and abusing alcohol. Marija Kovac/Stocksy United
• In a small study, current smokers who received treatment involving noninvasive low intensity electric or magnetic impulses were twice as likely to abstain from cigarettes for up six months versus placebo.
• Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), has emerged as a new therapeutic option for several conditions including pain management, weight reduction, alcohol use disorder, and or depressive disorder.
• The study’s authors pointed out early in the study that “tobacco use disorder is a major public health issue.” A new study says smokers receiving noninvasive low intensity electric or magnetic impulses were twice as likely to go without cigarettes for three to six months than those receiving placebo treatment. Researchers from the University of Dijon in France pooled data from seven previously published studies involving nearly 700 subjects. The results were on April 25 in the journal Addiction. “The results appear to be robust, and we feel confident in suggesting that noninvasive brain stimulation is a technique of interest for both short-term and sustained smoking cessation,” lead researcher Dr. Benjamin Petit said in the press release.

Research is applicable to other conditions The study pointed out that, in recent years, “a new non-pharmacological method, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), has emerged as a new therapeutic option for several conditions including specific pain management, weight reduction, alcohol use disorder or depressive disorder.” It said the two most commonly used forms of NIBS are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS). The latter involves administering a low intensity direct electrical current through the subject’s brain using a pair of saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes placed on the patient’s scalp, modulating neuronal excitability. TMS uses a metallic coil placed against the patient’s scalp. The coil generates magnetic pulses through the patient’s cranium to induce brief electric currents in the cortical tissue. Cortical neurons become depolarized and, depending on the frequency of the pulses, the excitability of the targeted cortical area is either increased or decreased. “There is a lot of interest in brain stimulation, especially in addiction centers and mental health clinics,” Dr. Manish Mishra, the medical reviewer for Addiction Resource, told Healthline. “The paper shows promising results despite the small sample size.” “Addiction to smoking is really difficult to get free from,” Mishra said. “It is good that the paper recognizes that the addiction stems from the primitive parts of the brain, instead of the thinking brain, showing us just how big their role is in a person’s day-to-day life.” “Many people think that it is simply an issue of willpower,” Mishra told Healthline. “There are studies proving that, yes, but this is true for a small percentage of people. However, the majority of smokers need additional, external support.” The study’s authors pointed out early in the study that “tobacco use disorder is a major public health issue.” “Approximately 15.2 percent of the global population smoke every day, which represents more than 933 million people. Around the world, tobacco use is linked to 110.7 per 100 000 deaths annually and 170.9 million disability-adjusted life years, reflecting the importance of the comorbidities it induces. Tobacco use disorder is an addictive behavior, and it is difficult for users to stop using, as in other addictions.” Several other studies are underway, Petit said. “In the near future, NIBS [noninvasive brain stimulation] might be recognized as a promising new option for assisting individuals who wish to stop smoking,” he said in a journal news release.

Dr. James Giordano, professor of neurology and biochemistry at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., told Healthline both TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and forms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) look like “viable” treatments for certain forms of addiction. “In particular, DBS has been, and is being studied for its therapeutic potential against addictive disorders, in that DBS can reduce the ‘addictive drive,’ as well as decrease the ‘reward effect’ of addictive behaviors,” Giordano told Healthline. Giordano said “TMS tends to work best when the treatments are repeated: two to three treatments per week for three to four. Net effects in decreasing nicotine craving and desire for smoking can last months and can be important to total cessation.” How the newer methods stack up to traditional methods of smoking cessation remains to be seen, Giordano told Healthline. “There is not a single ‘best way’ to quit smoking,” he said. “Some people can give up tobacco products ‘cold turkey,’ with little to no medical assistance, while others struggle considerably, even with medical intervention.” “What is important to understand is that nicotine addiction, like any form of addictive disorder, while having common neurological mechanisms, can differ greatly in its expression, severity, and resistance to treatment based upon variations in individual physiology, psychology, and even social influences,” Giordano said. “That is why it is best to develop a number of different therapeutic tools and methods, so as to establish more effective, efficient personalized and precision approaches to smoking cessation, and other addictive disorders.” Mishra said the first step in any treatment is always the same process. From there, many avenues are available. “In counseling, the awareness and admission that a person needs help is the first step of treatment,” Mishra told Healthline. “Behavior modification and CBT [cognitive behavioral therapy] where a person understands and explores their triggers and reshaping them are proven to be effective. Pharmacological treatments can also be used to supplement the treatment.”",0

• Researchers say older adults who walk between 6,000 and 9,000 steps per day have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.
• They added that daily walking did not reduce the risk of heart disease in younger adults.
• Experts say walking can boost overall physical health as well as mental health.
• They say playing golf as well as walking in the morning and evening are good ways to get in your daily steps. Happy New Year. Go for a walk. That’s the basic message from a new study that reports that older adults who walk 6,000 to 9,000 steps a day have a 40% to 50% reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as a heart attack or a stroke, compared to those who walk 2,000 steps per day. The research comes from a team led by Amanda Paluch, PhD, an assistant professor of kinesiology in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Paluch also leads an international consortium known as the Steps for Health Collaborative. The was published in the journal Circulation. “We found for adults over 60, there was a strikingly lower risk of a cardiovascular event or disease over an average follow-up of six years,” Paluch said in a statement. “When accumulating more steps per day, there was a progressively lower risk.”

by Paluch and the Steps for Health Collaborative in 2022 showed more movement, even below the often-referenced but unscientific threshold of 10,000 steps per day, was associated with longevity benefits. That meta-analysis used data from 15 studies involving nearly 50,000 people from four continents, finding that walking between 6,000 and 8,000 steps per day was linked with a lower risk of death from all causes among older adults. Paluch and her team then decided to examine the less-charted territory of steps per day and cardiovascular disease. They analyzed eight studies involving more than 20,000 people from the United States and 42 other countries. They got similar results in terms of the most beneficial range of steps.

Paluch said the most important public health message from the study is to encourage the least-active older adults to take more steps. “The people who are the least active have the most to gain,” Paluch said. “For those who are at 2,000 or 3,000 steps a day, doing a little bit more can mean a lot for their heart health. If you’re at 6,000 steps, getting to 7,000 and then to 8,000 also is beneficial, it’s just a smaller, incremental improvement.” The latest analysis found no link between steps per day and cardiovascular risk in younger adults. “This is because cardiovascular disease is a disease of aging and often doesn’t come to fruition until we’re at older ages,” said Paluch, whose work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “You’re not going to see many people develop cardiovascular disease after six years of follow-up in young to middle adulthood.”

How many steps are enough? Dr. Yu-Ming Ni, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in California, told Healthline the study is significant. He said the research didn’t support the 10,000-step goal, which he said came from a marketing campaign in Japan. “The greatest incremental benefit appears to be until 8,000 steps, after which the benefits are less pronounced,” he said. “In adults under 60 years old, there was an apparent small benefit to walking around 8,000 steps. However, the benefit was not significant.” “Thus, step counts may not be as important in younger adults, and rather other exercise parameters such as exercise frequency and intensity may be more relevant,” Ni added. “Steps may be a helpful way to improve exercise, with a goal of 8,000 steps instead of 10,000 steps. More steps are generally better, so even if 8,000 steps is not possible, any amount above 3,000 steps is generally seen as beneficial.”

Some ways to get your daily steps Erin Blakely is a licensed nursing home administrator specializing in gerontology. She’s also the founder of Senior Golf Source, a resource site for older people to stay fit through golf. She told Healthline golf is a great way for seniors to get their steps in without thinking too much. “As we age, our bodies tend to slow down and become less active,” Blakely said. “This leads to fragility and an increased risk of health-related issues. I would notice those that stayed active (i.e., walking) having much greater success for longevity.” Blakely told Healthline one round of golf equals about 12,000 steps – about 2,500 if using a golf cart. “For seniors looking for an enjoyable way to stay active while getting outside and socializing with peers, golfing is a great way to get in your steps,” Blakely said. “Not only does it provide gentle physical activity, but it also has many other benefits, such as increasing flexibility and balance while reducing stress levels from simply being out in nature.” Sabrina Romanoff, PsyD, a clinical psychologist in New York City, told Healthline whatever the method, it’s the walking that counts. “There are emotional and physical benefits of walking,” Romanoff said. “Specifically, when you wake up in the morning and start your day with a walk around the block – it will recalibrate your mind and prepare you for the day ahead. It’s a tangible reminder of the beauty, expansiveness, and people we live among and often breaks us out of a fixed mindset.” Romanoff suggested walking as a healthy way to both start and end one’s day. “This is one of the best habits to combat mental health struggles such as chronic anxiety and depression,” Romanoff said. “Similarly, walks at the end of the day help you unwind from the stress of the day and assist with the transition to sleep. Walking is ultimately a great reset button for the mind and body.”",0
663,"While several clinical trials have demonstrated that maintenance therapy with lenalidomide reduces the risk of disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma, there have been no definitive results regarding overall survival. While some previous studies found that maintenance lenalidomide after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant improved overall survival for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, others showed no benefit to this approach. Philip McCarthy, MD, Director of Blood & Marrow Transplant at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), will present the findings of an international team of researchers at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 52nd Annual Meeting in Chicago.

The new study is a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (formerly Cancer and Leukemia Group B) (CALGB) with support from the NCI, Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome (IFM), and the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA). It involved more than 1,200 participants. For this analysis, 605 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and treated with continuous lenalidomide (brand name Revlimid) following autologous stem cell transplant were compared to 604 patients who were treated with placebo or no maintenance. At seven years, 62% of those treated with maintenance lenalidomide had survived, compared to 50% of those in the control group. The benefit in overall survival was consistent across subgroups.

""Lenalidomide maintenance following autologous stem cell transplant can now be considered a standard of care for people with multiple myeloma,"" says Dr. McCarthy, senior author on the meta-analysis and Principal Investigator of the U.S. study, CALGB (Alliance) 100104. ""The improvements over the last decade in terms of both survival and quality of life for patients with this disease are striking, and very encouraging.""

665,"Scientists investigating the mechanics of the early stages of lung cancer have identified a new potential treatment, which could also aid early detection of the disease.

Levels of a key protein -- called TLR2 -- in tumours was found to predict a patient's survival after being diagnosed with lung cancer, a study shows.

A drug compound that activates TLR2 was tested in mice and was found to reduce tumour growth in the early stages of the disease.

With the five-year survival rate from late stage lung cancer only six per cent -- compared with 50 per cent when diagnosed earlier -- experts say the breakthrough could help spot the disease sooner and improve patient outcomes.

A group, led by researchers from the University of Edinburgh, discovered that TLR2 helps control some of the body's defense mechanisms when cancerous mutations occur in cells.

The protein is linked with senescence, a process whereby cells stop growing and secrete a variety of chemicals and other proteins which collectively act as warning signals and defences against cancer.

Senescent cells are present in early lung cancers, but are no longer present in late-stage cancers, suggesting that senescence can prevent cancer progression.

Having identified TLR2's importance, the team used data from human tumour samples to confirm that patients with high levels of the protein in the early stages of lung cancer had increased survival compared to those who had lower levels.

The team then used a drug known to activate TLR2 in a mouse model of lung cancer. Researchers found that the drug reduced lung tumour growth.

Experts hope these findings could lead to research into using senescence and the associated secreted chemicals as part of a screening programme to provide earlier lung cancer diagnosis.

Further research is needed, the team adds, such as clinical trials to confirm whether the drug is effective in humans.

The research is a collaboration between researchers from University of Edinburgh, University College London, University of Cantabria in Spain, the Spanish National Research Council and the Mayo Clinic in the USA.

The study is published in Cell Reports. It was funded by Cancer Research UK, Wellcome, the Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Government of Spain and the US National Institute of Aging.

Dr Fraser Millar, Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""I think these results are really exciting. Very little is known about the biology of early lung cancer and by understanding this process more we have identified a possible new treatment for this devastating disease. This project highlights the value of basic science research and how this can be translated into new treatments for patients.""",0

668,"Singer Nick Jonas was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 13. Nathan Congleton/NBC via Getty Images
• Singer Nick Jonas unveiled a new blood glucose monitoring system for people with type 1 diabetes during a Super Bowl ad.
• Experts say the Dexcom G7 CGM continuous blood monitoring system should make life easier for people with type 1 diabetes as well as caregivers.
• They noted that the price may be a barrier and that better insulin delivery systems need to be developed. Somewhere in all the swirling Super Bowl Sunday commercial silliness about beer, soda, and cellular service was an announcement that could make a serious difference for people with type 1 diabetes. Like many of the football game’s commercials, the ad was delivered by a celebrity, but in this case, he wasn’t trying too hard to be funny. He didn’t even try to sing the message. San Diego-based Dexcom introduced its new G7 CGM continuous blood monitoring system with singer Nick Jonas, who has type 1 diabetes, telling the camera “This small thing is the next big thing.” Then he seemingly flips the device up in the air, catches it, sticks it to his arm, and gets out his cell phone to start taking readings. “It’s not magic, it just feels that way,” Jonas says, snapping his fingers and disappearing into a puff of black smoke.

Jonas was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 13, so he has some knowledge of the subject. In a statement from Dexcom released last week, Jonas said “Dexcom CGM has changed my life and revolutionized the way I take care of my health.” “People with diabetes – whether type 1 or type 2 – should have the best technology available to manage their disease, and with Dexcom G7, they’ll have it. I’m excited for the opportunity to share this new device with the world and to raise awareness around the magic of CGM,” the singer added. “Raising awareness of this technology for the millions of Americans who need it is one key step toward ensuring people with diabetes have the best technology available to live beyond their diagnosis,” Jonas said.

Dexcom says its new G7 device is the most accurate and easy-to-use CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) device on the market. One of its biggest selling points is not needing multiple daily finger pricks with a sharp lancet to get a blood glucose reading. Finger pricks sometimes discourage people with diabetes from staying on top of their condition. Dexcom officials said nearly 5 million people in the United States with diabetes who use insulin were expected to watch Sunday’s Super Bowl LVII. About 3 million of those viewers don’t currently use CGM to manage their diabetes. The company also said the “low-profile, all-in-one wearable warms up faster than any other CGM on the market, sending real-time glucose readings automatically to a compatible smart device receiver, no painful fingersticks or burdensome scanning required.” Company officials added that the warm-up time is 30 minutes, compared to most other CGM devices that can take an hour or more. It also says it’s the only integrated CGM system “trusted for use during pregnancy, delivering better peace of mind to pregnant patients managing type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.”

Issues still need to be worked out As with any progression of medical technology, there are still issues to be worked out, experts say. “CGM has been a total game-changer for people living with diabetes and even people without who want to prevent chronic disease,” Karen Kennedy, a certified nutritionist in Washington state specializing in metabolic health supporting the use of continuous glucose monitors, told Healthline. “The G7 made some nice changes,” Kennedy noted. “The significant size reduction will be great for children particularly.” “The convenience of this makes better glucose control so much easier for people,” she added. “For children, it’s a gotta-do, as you can monitor your children or other loved ones from other devices. This is lifesaving to many.” Kennedy said, like most new medical technology, it probably won’t be cheap. “I’ve not seen USA prices released. Dexcom states they are working to get identical insurance coverage for it, as the G6 which was either 100 percent coverage, or a co-pay of $40 a month for most with private insurance, Medicaid or Medicare,” Kennedy said. “The cash pay has always been high, starting at $700 a month.”

Angie Victorio is a certified diabetes care and education specialist at DiaBettr.com. She told Healthline CGMs are also great for caregivers, who can help someone with diabetes adjust their diet and lower blood glucose levels. “The patient benefits as well because they see in real-time how their lifestyle affects their blood sugar. For instance, they can know their blood sugar shortly after a certain meal or after taking a walk – and then adjust accordingly,” she said. Victorio explained CGMs work by using a sensor that attaches to the skin with a small needle that enters just below the skin. The sensor measures glucose every one to five minutes and transmits readings to the app, which records it. She said people with diabetes like the convenience. The fingerpick calibration test isn’t too painful but can be uncomfortable over time and can callous the finger. “And the G7 is accurate enough that calibration is not required,” she said. Victorio told Healthline that cost will be a factor in how many people use the G7. “I imagine the G7 won’t be cheap because it’s brand new,” Victorio said. “Most or some of the costs of a CGM may be covered by health insurance but it depends on the provider and the specific plan. But without insurance, the CGM receiver and additional sensors/transmitters can cost anywhere from $200 to $500 a month.”",0

Dr Tedros's intended quote is: 'So, if it (the booster) is going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have the risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to children, which is not right.'
What occurred on Monday at the WHO press conference during his delivery of the word 'children' is that he got stuck on the first syllable 'chil' and it came out sounding like 'cil/kil.' He then correctly pronounced the same syllable immediately after, with it coming out audibly as 'cil-children'. Any other interpretation of this is 100% incorrect.

675,"Scientists develop novel vaccine for Lassa fever and rabies

A novel vaccine designed to protect people from both Lassa fever and rabies showed promise in preclinical testing, according to new research published in Nature Communications. The investigational vaccine, called LASSARAB, was developed and tested by scientists at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia; the University of Minho in Braga, Portugal; the University of California, San Diego; and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The inactivated recombinant vaccine candidate uses a weakened rabies virus vector, or carrier. The research team inserted genetic material from Lassa virus into the rabies virus vector so the vaccine expresses surface proteins from both the Lassa virus and the rabies virus. These surface proteins prompt an immune response against both Lassa and rabies viruses. The recombinant vaccine was then inactivated to “kill” the live rabies virus used to make the carrier.

There are currently no approved Lassa fever vaccines. Although Lassa fever is often a mild illness, some people experience serious symptoms, such as hemorrhage (severe bleeding) and shock. The overall Lassa virus infection case-fatality rate is about 1 percent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but that rate rises to 15 percent for patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever. People contract Lassa virus through contact with infected Mastomys rats and through exposure to an infected person’s bodily fluids. Lassa fever is endemic to West Africa where these rats are common. In 2018, Nigeria experienced its largest-ever Lassa fever outbreak, with 514 confirmed cases and 134 deaths from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.

Africa is also at high risk for human rabies. The WHO estimates that 95 percent of the estimated 59,000 human rabies deaths per year occur in Africa and Asia. Nearly all human rabies deaths are caused by bites or scratches from infected dogs. Effective rabies vaccines and post-exposure shots are available, but many deaths still occur in resource-limited countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The newly published findings show that LASSARAB, when administered with GLA-SE adjuvant (an immune response-stimulating protein), elicits antibodies against Lassa virus and rabies virus in mouse and guinea pig models. The vaccine also protected guinea pigs from Lassa fever after being exposed to the virus 58 days after vaccination.

Prior research indicated that an antibody-mediated immune response is not correlated with protection from Lassa fever, the authors note. However, the new findings show that high levels of non-neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to the Lassa virus surface protein correlate with protection against Lassa virus. Levels of this type of antibody could potentially be a Lassa fever correlate of protection used to determine vaccine efficacy, according to the authors. They note the next step is to evaluate the experimental vaccine in nonhuman primates before advancing to human clinical trials.

678,"NIH-funded study compared more than 1.1 million students across nine states.

Schools with mandatory masking during the Delta surge had approximately 72% fewer cases of in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to schools with optional or partial masking policies, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study included more than 1.1 million students and over 157,000 staff attending in-person school across nine states: North Carolina, Wisconsin, Missouri, California, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee, Kansas and Texas. The study is supported by NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics – Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) program and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). It appears in Pediatrics.

The authors pointed out that their study was conducted when Delta was the dominant variant, and that their study did not obtain data on school masking in preventing the spread of the Omicron variant. However, they added that masking remains a critical preventive measure in times with high community infection rates with more transmissible variants, such as Omicron.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its guidelines for masking and other preventive measures, taking into account community levels of COVID-19. The CDC recommends indoor masking in areas with high community levels of COVID-19. CDC’s COVID-19 Community levels recommendations align precautions for educational settings with those for other community settings.

In the current study, most COVID-19 cases among students and staff were acquired from the community and approximately 10% of cases were acquired within school. The researchers found that for every 100 community-acquired cases, school districts with mandatory masking had approximately 7.3 cases of in-school infections, while optionally masked districts had 26.4 cases of in-school infections. In other words, school districts with optional masking had approximately 3.6 times the rate of in-school COVID-19 cases when compared to schools with mandatory masking. These data also show that mandatory masking was associated with a 72% reduction of in-school COVID-19 cases, compared to districts with optional masking.

The study included 61 school districts (kindergarten through grade 12) that provided data from July 26, 2021, through Dec. 13, 2021, a period encompassing the Delta surge and preceding the Omicron surge. In total, there were 40,601 primary infections acquired in the community (36,032 among students, 4,569 among staff) and 3,085 secondary infections acquired in school (2,844 among students, 241 among staff). Of these school districts, six districts (10%) had optional masking policies; nine had partial masking, i.e., policies that changed during the study or only applied to certain grade levels (15%); and the remaining 46 districts (75%) required masking for the entirety of the study.

684,"Researchers get a handle on how to control blood sugar after stroke

Hyperglycemia, or high levels of glucose, is common in patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with worse outcomes compared to normal blood sugar levels. Animal studies also pointed to an effect of high blood sugar in worsening stroke injury. Stroke experts have debated whether intensive glucose management after acute ischemic stroke leads to better outcomes but a new study in JAMA finds that aggressive methods are not better than standard approaches. The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“After decades of uncertainty about how to manage blood sugar in acute stroke patients we finally have strong clinical evidence that aggressive lowering does not improve patient outcome,” said Walter Koroshetz, M.D., NINDS director.

The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) study, a large, multisite clinical study led by Karen C. Johnston, M.D., professor of neurology and Associate Vice President of Clinical & Translational Research at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, compared two commonly used strategies for glucose control in ischemic stroke patients. More than 1100 patients underwent intensive glucose management, which required the use of intravenous delivery of insulin to bring blood sugar levels down to 80-130 mg/dL, or standard glucose control using insulin shots, which aimed to get glucose below 180 mg/dL, for up to 72 hours. After 90 days, the patients were evaluated for outcomes, including disability, neurological function, and quality of life.

The results suggested that the two treatments were equally effective at helping the patients recover from their strokes. After 90 days, about 20% of the patients showed favorable outcomes regardless of whether they were given intensive or standard treatment.

Intense glucose therapy increased the risk of very low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and required a higher level of care such as increased supervision from nursing staff, compared to standard treatment.

The study was stopped early when a pre-planned interim analysis revealed that intensive glucose control did not improve outcomes compared to standard treatment.

“We found that the extra risks associated with aggressive treatment were not worth it,” said Dr. Johnston. “We are so grateful to the patients and research teams from across the country who helped us answer this important question. As a result of their participation, patients around the world will benefit.”

This study was supported by NINDS’ Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) Network, a system of research institutions dedicated to emergency medical issues, including stroke. The study was also conducted in collaboration with NINDS’ StrokeNet, which is a network of hospitals providing resources for multi-site clinical trials evaluating new therapies to treat stroke.

More research is needed to better understand the role of glucose in stroke recovery and to identify additional treatments to improve outcomes in hyperglycemic stroke patients. Future studies will also determine whether high blood sugar is a cause or effect of unfavorable stroke outcomes.

This study was supported by the NINDS (NS069498, NS056975, NS059041).

NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.

688,"New research suggests that sports fans experience lower rates of depression and loneliness than non-fans. Thomas Barwick/Getty Images
• Being a fan can bring a sense of belonging and community.
• A new book by sports fans found that while 61% of Americans report experiencing loneliness, non-fans are lonelier than fans.
• Whether it’s sports, music, cosplay, comics, video games, or beyond, finding your fandom community can enhance your mental well-being. Putting on your team’s jersey, inviting friends over to watch the game, cheering and shouting at the TV in unison — the bond sports fans share is undeniable. “[Sports] are an ever-present facilitator of connection. Sports are the reason to get people together, the reason to send that text message, the reason to check in with your parents, and so on. Sports anchor and galvanize relationships; they facilitate social interactions,” David Sikorjak, co-author of Fans Have More Friends, told Healthline. But sports may be more than that, too. “It is good for you, good for others, and good for society,” Sikorjak said.

How researchers measured the effects of fandom In the book he co-authored with Ben Valenta, senior vice president at Fox Sports, the authors argue that fandom is a social good with the potential to mitigate the loneliness epidemic in the United States. While the authors suspected sports fans to experience some degree of belonging, they were surprised to find a lonelier, more polarized population than they expected, and through research, they discovered that fandom may offer more meaningful, impactful benefits. For instance, they found that while 61% of Americans report experiencing loneliness, non-fans may be lonelier than fans. “To examine that idea, we developed a more testable hypothesis: if being a sports fan is about community, then more engaged fans will have more friends than non-fans/less engaged fans. And through multiple surveys across tens of thousands of Americans, we proved that out,” said Sikorjak. If fans have more friends, it stands to reason that they would feel less lonely, added Valenta. The authors tested this proposition using the UCLA Loneliness Scale, a 20-item scale designed to measure one’s subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation.

To understand how fandom helps with loneliness, Valenta said to think about a Fan Flywheel, which is a positive feedback loop where there are two variables: X and Y. X influences Y, and Y then, in turn, influences X, which creates a positive feedback loop that sustains momentum and creates energy. “Essentially, you lean into your fandom, you participate in fan activities, you engage as a fan; that’s the X in this example. And that creates the positive feedback of social interactions, the Y variable, which incentivizes you to lean into more fan activities, more fan engagement, which only then begets more social interaction,” Valenta told Healthline. “Once it starts to spin, it takes over.” The book’s findings suggest that sports fandom may create greater belonging in one’s life. “And it might not come right away, but as you participate in your fantasy football leagues, and you go to games with your friends, and you invite the family over for the game, etc., you will begin to experience more belonging in your life,” he said.
• The more engaged the sports fan, the stronger their family ties
• Fans report higher satisfaction with their careers and relationships
• Fans are more likely to vote and exhibit greater trust in cultural institutions
• Fans are more likely to report feelings of happiness and gratitude

Other types of fandom can create belonging, too For those who aren’t into sports but find fandom in other forms of entertainment like cosplay, conventions, comics, movies, video games, and beyond, Paul Booth PhD, professor of media and cinema studies at DePaul University, said you still might reap similar feelings of belonging and community. “Being part of any group helps people feel connected, which is a major component of our mental health. When you’re not as lonely, you tend to have a higher positive mental health,” he told Healthline. “Fandom is about being part of something larger than yourself. In some ways, it’s also about feeling like you matter.” Over the past decade, he said fans have become an integral part of the media landscape via social media, which has allowed them to speak to producers, influence decisions, and in some cases, find jobs in the industry. “[And] maybe in some ways, feeling productive helps people,” he said. He distinguishes being a fan, which is liking something and having an emotional reaction to it, from fandom, which is sharing that affinity with a group of people. Moreover, he added that fandom is often a smaller group within a larger circle of fans. “There isn’t one fandom for Star Trek or Marvel; it’s lots of little pockets of fandom that collectively look different from each other,” Booth said. The internet has allowed more people to be part of a variety of fandoms. However, Booth notes that some fandom groups can be toxic. “They can be very angry and misogynist, racist in some ways, and fans might not feel welcome in that sort of a group,” he said.

Sports fandom more accepted than other types of fandom Valenta agreed that a myriad of shared interests can anchor and galvanize a relationship, and he promotes healthy connection in any form. However, he believes that sports are uniquely positioned to generate connections. “Sports are the entryway into discussions of life. Yes, you will talk the ins and outs of the game, and that is good in and of itself, but with the strengthening bond formed as a result of sports, the opportunities for deeper and more meaningful conversations unfold,” he said. This is the case with other forms of fandom, noted Booth. However, he pointed out that sports is community-driven, so people tend to be fans of the sports teams where they live, go to school, or to which they have some sort of connection. He said this often isn’t the case with media fandom. “Also, sports fans tend to be not just fans of their team, but anti-fans of other teams, so part of showing your allegiance or fandom to the Chicago Bears is being an anti-fan of the Packers,” said Booth. While this occurs a little bit in media fandom, it’s not as strong of a requirement, he added. “I could be a fan of Star Trek and Star Wars; it’s not like they’re pitted against each other,” said Booth. The biggest difference he noted between sports fandom and other forms of fandom is that sports are readily accepted as a fandom in our culture, whereas media fandom is not. For example, it’s not considered weird for people to wear team jerseys on the street or for someone to say they’re missing a social outing to watch a game.

701,"A new study reveals how a rare genetic mutation leads to intellectual disability. The P212L mutation in an enzyme called CaMKIIalpha, which is important for learning and memory, is known to be linked to intellectual disability. However, the exact process by which the mutation affected the enzyme's activity was unclear, until now. A newly developed method of protein analysis has shown that the P212L mutation causes dramatically more activation of CaMKIIalpha. This has enabled researchers to identify a potential treatment using existing medicine, and this new method could be adapted to analyze other genetic causes of disability and disease in the future.

About 1% of the global population lives with an intellectual disability. There are several commonly known causes including infection, injury or genetic conditions. CaMKIIalpha is an enzyme that mediates biochemical reactions in the brain and is important for our ability to learn. Typical learning requires that CaMKIIalpha activity is regulated at appropriate levels and at the appropriate timing, and irregularities with it have previously been linked to a variety of neurological disorders. One known cause of intellectual disability is a P212L mutation in CaMKIIalpha. Although the association between intellectual disability and the mutation is known, exactly how the enzyme's mutation alters its function was not previously understood.

The mutation of P212L is very rare, but a patient was identified in Japan who then took part in a study with researchers from the University of Tokyo and Nagoya University. ""This is only the fourth known case of this P212L mutation in the world. However, the relationship between this single gene mutation and symptoms is relatively clear, making it important in the study of intellectual disability,"" said Hajime Fujii, lecturer from the Graduate School of Medicine at the University of Tokyo.

Since reactions at this scale are not directly visible to our eyes, they must be monitored through other techniques. However, these experiments are usually laborious and time consuming. ""It is difficult to process many samples in parallel and not possible to measure enzyme activity in physiological conditions, such as living cells or synapses. We wanted something more simple, scalable, sensitive and quantitative. So, we developed a method to measure enzyme activity by fluorescent probe,"" explained Fujii. ""This can tell us the progress of a biochemical reaction by its brightness or color. In order to create a fluorescent probe, we had to couple the biochemical reaction, such as molecular binding or changes in protein shape (that occur at the scale of a nanometer), with fluorescence brightness or color. So, we used a physical phenomenon called FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer), with which the probe can change relative brightness between two colors according to changes of the CaMKIIalpha that occur when it is activated. We call our approach a FRET-based kinase phenotyping strategy.""

This new method enabled the team to rapidly and accurately analyze nearly a hundred cell extracts and study their biological activity. What it found was that CaMKIIalpha with the P212L mutation exhibited enhanced activation compared to usual. This means that rewiring or changes in the brain that usually occur during learning may possibly be irregular in people with this mutation, compared to people without it. The researchers also found that in neurons, taken from rats in this study, the CaMKIIalpha response to stimulation was increased. The activation response of the enzyme rose faster and fell slower, again demonstrating an unusually enhanced response.

The team hopes that its research will help to identify treatment options for genetically based intellectual disabilities. In this case, it found that memantine, a drug currently used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, caused a suppression of the P212L mutation's effect in neurons. ""The next step would be to determine in more detail how irregular CaMKIIalpha activation causes intellectual disability and examine whether suppressing irregular activation with memantine can treat intellectual disability,"" said Fujii.

""So far, there has been no effective medical treatment for children with genetically based intellectual disability. This study can offer the possibility of treatment to patients with intellectual disability who have this rare variant of CaMKII"" said Assistant Professor Hiroyuki Kidokoro from Nagoya University, a paper co-author and pediatrician who worked with the patient.

Looking to the future, Fujii said, ""Mutations in CaMKIIalpha have been related to other neurodevelopmental disorders, so we may be able to clarify the development of and treatment strategies for these mutations in the same way, by applying this FRET-based kinase phenotyping platform. To apply our strategy to mutations of other genes that cause various diseases, we will need fluorescent probes to measure the functions of the genes. Currently, fluorescent probes are available for some genes, but not others, so it will be necessary to develop new fluorescent probes, which may take some time.""",0
704,"Zika virus infection appears to affect oxygen delivery to the fetuses of pregnant monkeys, according to a small study funded by the National Institutes of Health. Researchers also observed a high degree of inflammation in the placenta and lining of the uterus, which can harm the fetal immune system and increase a newborn’s susceptibility to additional infections. Their study is published online in Nature Communications.

Zika virus infection among pregnant women can lead to developmental problems in fetuses and newborns. In the current study, researchers led by Daniel Streblow, Ph.D., of the Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute at Oregon National Primate Research Center, used non-invasive imaging to evaluate how persistent Zika infection affects pregnancy in five rhesus macaques. The team found that the virus induces high levels of inflammation in the blood vessels of the uterus and damages placental villi, the branch-like growths that help transfer oxygen and nutrients from maternal blood to the fetus. The researchers suggest that this damage may disrupt oxygen transport to the fetus, which can restrict its growth and lead to stillbirth, among other conditions.

The team observed evidence of fetal brain abnormalities in two of the five animals, but the researchers did not see any obvious signs of microcephaly. This finding, they reason, is consistent with previous studies that establish microcephaly as only one of a spectrum of Zika-induced complications. The authors call for additional studies to improve knowledge of how Zika virus causes infection during pregnancy.

708,"Two pioneering studies published simultaneously today in Nature and Genome Medicine, have identified genetic signatures explaining ethnic differences in the severity of prostate cancer, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Through genetic sequencing of prostate cancer tumours from Australian, Brazilian and South African donors, the team identified a new prostate cancer taxonomy (classification scheme) and cancer drivers that not only distinguish patients by genetic ancestry, but also predict which cancers are likely to become life-threatening -- a task that currently proves challenging.

""Our understanding of prostate cancer has been severely limited by a research focus on Western populations,""said senior author Professor Vanessa Hayes, genomicist and Petre Chair of Prostate Cancer Research at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Medicine and Health in Australia.

""Being of African descent, or from Africa, more than doubles a man's risk for lethal prostate cancer. While genomics holds a critical key to unravelling contributing genetic and non-genetic factors, data for Africa has till now, been lacking.""

""Prostate cancer is the silent killer in our region,"" said University of Pretoria's Professor Riana Bornman, an international expert in men's health and clinical lead for the Southern African Prostate Cancer Study in South Africa.

""We had to start with a grassroots approach, engaging communities with open discussion, establishing the infrastructure for African inclusion in the genomic revolution, while determining the true extent of prostate disease.""

Through sophisticated whole genome sequencing (a way of mapping the entire genetic code of cancer cells), over two million cancer-specific genomic variants were identified in 183 untreated prostate tumours from men living across the three study regions.

""We found Africans to be impacted by a greater number and spectrum of acquired (including cancer driver) genetic alterations, with significant implications for ancestral consideration when managing and treating prostate cancer,"" said Professor Hayes.

""Using cutting-edge computational data science which allowed for pattern recognition that included all types of cancer variants, we revealed a novel prostate cancer taxonomy which we then linked to different disease outcomes,"" said Dr Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri, a computational biologist from the University of Sydney and first author on the Nature paper.

""Combining our unique dataset with the largest public data source of European and Chinese cancer genomes allowed us to, for the first time, place the African prostate cancer genomic landscape into a global context.""

As part of her PhD at the University of Sydney, Dr Tingting Gong, first author on the Genome Medicine paper, painstakingly sifted through the genomic data for large changes in the structure of chromosomes (molecules that hold genetic information). These changes are often overlooked because of the complexity involved in computationally predicting their presence, but are an area of critical importance and contribution to prostate cancer.

""We showed significant differences in the acquisition of complex genomic variation in African and European derived tumours, with consequences for disease progression and new opportunities for treatment,"" said Dr Gong.

This cancer genome resource is possibly the first and largest to include African data, in the world.

""Through African inclusion, we have made the first steps not only towards globalising precision medicine but ultimately to reducing the impact of prostate cancer mortality across rural Africa,"" explains Professor Bornman.

""A strength of this study was the ability to generate and process all data through a single technical and analytical pipeline,"" added Professor Hayes.

The research featured in the Nature and Genome Medicine paper is part of the legacy of the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. He was the first African to have his complete genome sequenced, data which would be an integral part of genetic sequencing and prostate cancer research in southern Africa.

The results of the sequencing were published in Nature in 2010.

""Diagnosed at age 66 with advanced prostate cancer, to which he succumbed in late December 2021, the Archbishop was an advocate not only for prostate cancer research in southern Africa, but also the benefits that genomic medicine would offer all peoples,"" recollected Professor Hayes.

""We hope this study is a first step to that realisation.""

The international research team included academics from the University of Sydney in Australia, and affiliated institutions at St Vincent's Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Garvan Institute of Medical Research and Chris O'Brien Lifehouse; in South Africa from the University of Pretoria, University of Limpopo, and Sefako Makgatho Health Science University, and including the Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital, Kalafong Academic Hospital and National Health Laboratory Services; in Brazil from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, with additional contributions for the Genome Medicine paper from the University of Melbourne and Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Australia.

711,"Pancreatic cancer has few treatment options and limited survival, with only 9% of patients still living five years after diagnosis.

But a detailed analysis of pancreatic cancer by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has revealed details of two key transition points in the development of these tumors -- the shift from normal cells to precancerous cells, and the change from precancerous to cancerous cells. Understanding these transitions will help lead to the development of novel therapies. The study also provides insights into treatment resistance and how immunotherapy could be harnessed to treat this aggressive tumor type.

The study, published Aug. 22 in the journal Nature Genetics, is part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network, funded by the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Moonshot program, all part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Also, as part of an ongoing phase 1 immunotherapy clinical trial at Siteman Cancer Center -- based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine -- the researchers are conducting the same detailed analyses performed in the current study to see how tumors from patients respond to two investigational drugs that prime the immune system to attack the cancer.

""Pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat, and to develop better treatments we need to understand how normal, healthy cells in the pancreas transition to becoming cancerous,"" said co-senior author and computational biologist Li Ding, PhD, the David English Smith Distinguished Professor of Medicine and a professor of genetics. ""This marks the first time these transitions have been mapped out in such detail in human tumors. Our findings are jumping off points for the future development of new treatment strategies for this deadly cancer.""

The researchers conducted a deep analysis of the genetics and protein manufacturing of 83 pancreatic tumor samples donated by 31 patients who participated in the study. They noted how the tumors differed across the volume of the tumor and at various times as the patients underwent treatment.

""We have a lot of snapshots of these tumors, but what we really need is a movie,"" said co-senior author Ryan C. Fields, MD, the Kim and Tim Eberlein Distinguished Professor. ""It's very hard to study these tumors in patients across the spectrum of treatment. The point of the Human Tumor Atlas Network is to document the tumors across space and time so we have more of a continuous movie rather than distinct snapshots.""

Ding, Fields and their colleagues, including fellow co-senior author David G. DeNardo, PhD, a professor of medicine, mapped out two key transition points in the development of pancreatic cancer. One involves the shift normal pancreatic cells make as they become precancerous. And the second transition point involves the shift from precancerous cells to early cancer cells. Future studies will focus on a third key transition point: that of the original tumor shifting to metastatic disease, which spreads to other parts of the body.

Beyond maps of the transitions, Ding and her colleagues determined the characteristics of cells in these transitory states, opening the door to future strategies to detect cells that are not yet cancerous but are on their way, which could lead to the development of ways to prevent the onset of cancer.

Another key finding relates to a new strategy for so-called checkpoint immunotherapy, which has proven ineffective in attacking pancreatic tumors. The researchers identified a new combination of signaling molecules that could potentially prove useful in targeting T cells to pancreatic tumor cells. Such a treatment would also ""take the brakes off"" the T cells to kill those cancer cells.

""The surface molecules that make traditional checkpoint inhibitors work on other cancers are simply absent in pancreatic tumors,"" Ding said. ""We basically found a parallel interaction using two different molecules that are present in pancreatic cancer. We are excited about the prospect of exploring this interaction as a way to develop a new type of checkpoint immunotherapy for this tumor type.""

Over time, most pancreatic tumors develop resistance to chemotherapy, and the new study reveals what Ding calls a chemo-resistance signature that characterizes how the tumors change and adapt to survive even in the face of chemotherapy.

The researchers found that a threefold increase in inflammatory cells surrounding the tumor -- called inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts -- is strongly associated with resistance to chemotherapy. ""These findings suggest that targeting the inflammatory fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may be key to overcoming chemo-resistance in these treated tumors,"" Ding said.

Overall, the study presents a number of new strategies and areas to explore in pancreatic cancer research. Ding, Fields and DeNardo are working in preclinical animal models to determine which are most promising to investigate in future human clinical trials.

715,"A prospective seroprevalence study in the Catalan population underlines the need to get vaccinated despite having been infected, and confirms that hybrid immunity (vaccination plus infection) is more robust and long-lasting. The study, co-led by the Barcelona Institute for Global supported by the Daniel Bravo Andreu Foundation (FDBA), has been published in BMC Medicine.

Both infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 contribute to building a population's immunity to the virus -- an important factor for deciding when and to whom booster shots should be offered. Although immunity against a pathogen is more than antibodies, the easiest strategy for assessing population immunity is to perform seroepidemiological studies (i.e., quantifying virus-specific antibodies in a given population group).

""Most of the serological studies performed after COVID-19 vaccination focused on specific groups such as healthcare workers, did not distinguish between people with or without previous infection, or did not have clinical and immunological data of the infection,"" explains Manolis Kogevinas, ISGlobal researcher and senior co-author of the study together with Carlota Dobaño, also researcher at ISGlobal.

In this study, the research team performed a second measurement in a population-based cohort from Catalonia (COVICAT study -- GCAT cohort) six months after the start of the vaccination campaign (the first one was just after the first confinement), to monitor the level and type of antibodies against five viral antigens (the whole Spike (S) protein, the RBD receptor binding domain, the S2 fragment, the full nucleocaspid (N) protein, or the N-terminal fragment). They also used information from a questionnaire and health records to identify potential factors that determine the magnitude and duration of the antibody response in unvaccinated, vaccinated, or vaccinated and infected persons. A total of 1,076 people, aged 43 to 72 years, were included in the analysis.

The results yielded three main conclusions: First, that in 36% of infected but unvaccinated persons, antibodies were no longer detectable almost a year after the infection, particularly in those older than 60 years and smokers.

Second, that vaccination induced significantly higher antibody levels in people who had a prior infection, as compared to those without prior infection; and that these levels were strongly associated with the magnitude of the response during the infection. ""Our data underscore the importance of vaccinating people even if they have been previously infected, and confirm that hybrid immunity is superior and more durable. This means that people who have been vaccinated but have not been infected would need a booster earlier than those who have,"" points out Marianna Karachaliou, first author of the study together with Gemma Moncunill.

Third, the factor most strongly associated with the level of antibodies is the type of vaccine -- Moderna's Spikevax generated the highest levels of antibodies. Other factors also appear to play a role: people older than 60 or with mental illness had lower antibody levels post-vaccination. ""The association between mental health and antibody responses requires further investigation, but it is known that people with disorders such as depression, chronic stress or schizophrenia have a lower response to vaccination in general,"" explains Dobaño.

Among those vaccinated, only 2.1% had no antibodies at the time of testing and approximately 1% had a breakthrough infection. ""However, it should be noted that this study was done before the Omicron variant became dominant,"" warns Kogevinas.",0
716,"Aug. 5, 2022 -- One in eight adults diagnosed with COVID-19 will likely experience long-term symptoms, a large study published this week shows.

To reach that conclusion, the researchers compared long-term symptoms in people infected by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, with similar symptoms in uninfected people over the same time period.

Among the group of infected study participants in the Netherlands, 21.4% had at least one new or severely increased symptom 3 to 5 months after infection compared to before infection. When that 21.4% was compared to 8.7% of uninfected people in the same study, the researchers were able to calculate that 12.7% of the patients experienced long COVID.

“This finding shows that post-COVID-19 condition is an urgent problem with a mounting human toll,” the study authors write.

Christopher Brightling and Rachael Evans, PhD, of the Institute for Lung Health, University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, who were not involved in the study, said in a separate editorial, “This is a major advance on prior long COVID … estimates as it includes a matched uninfected group and accounts for symptoms before COVID-19 infection.”",0

719,"Each year, between 25 and 35 children in the United States and Canada are diagnosed with an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome called Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA), according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although rare, this syndrome causes a deficiency in producing red blood cells that is devastating for patients and their families. The only treatment, other than blood transfusions, is glucocorticoids -- steroids that cause unwanted and even dangerous side effects, including stunted growth, osteoporosis, cataracts, and glaucoma.

Whitehead Institute Founding Member Harvey Lodish first took an interest in DBA back in 2007 at a small meeting of researchers and patient families. When he learned that there was no clear understanding of why glucocorticoids seemed to help DBA patients, he decided to devote a portion of his lab's efforts to solving this mystery.

""We're not only trying to understand how to treat a rare disease, but we're also trying to understand a basic biological problem, which is how stem cells and certain other types of cells make a decision when they divide,"" says Lodish, who is also Professor of Biology and Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT. ""What kind of cell does a blood- forming stem cell become, a stem cell like its parent, or a cell that begins the process of differentiation towards forming a red blood cell or a white blood cell?""

Now research in Lodish's lab has identified a cell receptor that, when stimulated by a currently approved cholesterol-lowering drug, and used in combination with low amounts of glucocorticoids, causes a three- to five-fold increase in red blood cell production. The research, which is described online in the journal Nature, is serving as the foundation for an upcoming clinical trial.

Unlike some anemias, DBA cannot be treated by erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that controls red blood cell production by causing red blood cell progenitors, called colony forming unit-erythroids (CFU-Es), to divide and differentiate into red blood cells. In DBA, the CFU-Es die before they can make red blood cells, and patients have too few CFU-Es to make EPO treatment effective.

In 2010, Lodish and his lab determined that glucocorticoids increase red blood cells in EPO-resistant anemias, including DBA, by acting on burst-forming unit-erythroids (BFU-Es), which are cells that, when they divide, can produce multiple CFU-Es. Glucocorticoids increase the likelihood that when BFU-Es divide, one or both of the resulting cells remains a BFU-E instead of differentiating into CFU-Es. Patients treated with glucocorticoids have more BFU-Es, which in turn produce more CFU-Es and, ultimately, more red blood cells.

Recently, Sherry Lee and Xiaofei Gao, both postdoctoral researchers in the Lodish lab, screened for drugs that could interact with and boost glucocorticoids' activity. Because glucocorticoids act by binding to a receptor in the cytoplasm that migrates into the nucleus and affects expression of multiple genes, the scientists screened for drugs that inhibit or activate other nuclear receptors. Two drugs used for lipid disorders worked with glucocorticoids to increase red blood cell production in vitro. Both of those drugs, including fenofibrate, activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. Fenofibrate was approved by the FDA in 2001 and has been used to treat high cholesterol in adults and children.

When Lee and Gao studied the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids and fenofibrate, they determined that the glucocorticoid receptor binds to approximately 1000 sites in the DNA and turns on a large number of genes. Fenofibrate activates the PPAR alpha receptor, which subsequently binds adjacent to the glucocorticoid receptor on the DNA. The two receptors modulate a cohort of genes that are critical for BFU-E cell self-renewal and ultimately that produce more red blood cells.

Combined treatment of a glucocorticoid and fenofibrate significantly increased levels of red blood cell numbers in a mouse model of chronic anemia. In fact, the synergy between the two drugs was so powerful that the mice did not require treatment with glucocorticoids.

""The dosage of fenofibrate used in treating EPO-resistant anemia is lower than the treatment for high cholesterol,"" says Lee, who is a co-author of the Nature paper with Gao. ""Given the well-documented safety profile of fenofibrate, we expect fewer side effects when using fenofibrate to treat anemia.""

Lee and Gao's research was partially funded by the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation (DBAF), an organization that strives to educate patients and the medical community and to advance research initiatives that promote a better understanding and treatment for DBA.

""DBAF, in partnership with DBA Canada (DBAC), is proud to support the hard work and commitment of Dr. Lodish and his entire lab,"" says Dawn Baumgardner, DBAF's Executive Director. ""The prospects of a clinical trial and better treatment options are exciting and anxiously anticipated by the entire DBA community. This research gives our DBA patients and families hope and may also lead to significant progress and implications for other disorders. The DBAF and DBAC are grateful to Dr. Lodish's lab and our DBA families around the world for their tireless efforts.""

The results from Lee and Gao's preliminary work are so promising that Shilpa Hattangadi, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics (Hematology/Oncology) and Pathology at Yale School of Medicine and a former researcher in the Lodish lab, is leading a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a glucocorticoid/fenofibrate treatment in children with DBA.

""Four years ago, I was at an annual DBA meeting where I suggested doing a screen of FDA-approved drugs,"" says Dr. Hattangadi. ""It's exciting to have four years later the Lodish lab publish the results of such a screen, and within six months, start designing the clinical trial and recruiting patients. I'm a physician/researcher, and this is what I trained to do.""

Beyond the treatment of DBA, Gao is optimistic about the impact that glucocorticoids/fenofibrate treatment may have on seemingly unrelated conditions.

""Glucocorticoids represent one of the most prescribed classes of drugs,"" he says. ""Basically, if PPAR alpha is important in a disease that is currently treated by glucocorticoids, we may have a new way to treat those diseases that reduces the harmful side effects of glucocorticoids. That could affect a lot of patients.""",0
721,"The androgen receptor is a key transcriptional factor for the proper sex development -- specially in males -- and the physiological balance of all the tissues that express this receptor. The androgen receptor is involved in several pathologies and syndromes, such as the spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or androgen insensitivity syndrome, among others, for which there is no specific treatment. Regarded as the main initial and progression factor in prostate cancer -- the second most common malignant disease in men in industrialized countries -- , this receptor has been, for decades, the main therapeutical target for the treatment against this disease.

Now, a study published in the journal Science Advances describes the structural and functional effects of mutations on the androgen receptor, as well as how these changes lead to the development of prostate cancer. The study is led by lecturer Eva Estébanez-Perpiñá, from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine of the Faculty of Biology and from the Institute of Biomedicine of the University of Barcelona (IBUB) -- with headquarters at the Barcelona Science Park (PCB) -- , in collaboration with the experts Pablo Fuentes-Prior, former head of a research group at the Research Institute of Sant Pau (IBB Sant Pau), and Álvaro Aytés, from the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) and the Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO).

The study, whose first coauthors are Andrea Alegre and Alba Jiménez (UB-IBUB) and Adrián Martínez (ICO and IDIBELL), includes the participation of the team led by lecturer Jaime Rubio Martínez, from the Faculty of Chemistry and the UB Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (IQTC), and groups from CSIC and the National Institute of Health and MedicalResearch in France (INSERM).

The human androgen receptor is a key protein in the development and functioning of the prostate in response to male hormones, such as testosterone. Point mutations in the androgen receptor -- specifically, one aminoacid changing for another -- are one of the main mechanisms than can lead to structural and functional alterations in the receptor, which result in the development of diseases.

The results of the study show that the analysed mutations affect several functional regions of the union domain of the androgen receptor to testosterone. In particular, these are mutations that alter a region of the receptor which is the target for posttranscriptional modifications (that is, modifications in the protein once this is produced).

This type of chemical alterations affect specific amino acids of the androgen receptor and are executed by regulating proteins which are decisive for the proper functioning of the receptor. If this receptor's regulation pathway is altered -- such as the case of the presence of mutations described by the team -- , its function is deregulated and it can be dysfunctional and cause pathologies.

""In our study, we experimentally checked that these mutations deregulate a specific mutation, known as arginine methylation, which is one of the posttranscriptional modifications, due to the structural changes these alterations produce in a functional area of the receptor. Also, we could observe that the deregulation of the androgen receptor methylation involves relevant changes in its function within the cell,"" the team concludes.",0
728,"Researchers have developed a new type of sensor that acts like Velcro® for prostate cancer cells, sticking them to a modified frosted glass slide, like those used in science classes, so that they can be identified from blood samples. The low-cost method, reported in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, could help doctors better diagnose and monitor the disease.

In men with prostate cancer, some tumor cells exit the prostate gland and circulate in the blood. Detecting these cells could enable diagnosis at an earlier stage or help doctors assess whether treatment is effective. However, because circulating tumor cells are present in very small numbers, finding them can be a challenge. Previous sensors have been expensive and difficult to make. So Shudong Zhang and Shutao Wang wanted do develop a simpler, more cost-effective way to monitor prostate cancer cells in the blood.

The researchers based their device on frosted glass microscope slides, commonplace in high school science classes. The frosted area, which is used to hold and label the slide, is a sandblasted surface with tiny depressions. The researchers added a solution to the frosted slides that caused silica nanowires to grow on their surfaces, then they dangled antibodies that recognized prostate cancer cells from the nanowires. After getting captured by the antibodies, circulating tumor cells became trapped in the depressions on the slide and tangled up within the nanowires, similar to the interlocking surfaces of Velcro®. The team could then visualize the cancer cells with microscopy, and found that the device had a capture efficiency on par with other approaches, they say. When the researchers tested blood samples from prostate cancer patients, the devices detected as few as 10 tumor cells in 1 milliliter of blood.",0

Compared with patients who did not have surgery, those who did rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report issues with pain and feelings of depression. Patients have also experienced normalized blood sugar levels, blood pressure and the remission of Type 2 diabetes. Dr. Stacy Brethauer discusses his research.

731,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among males in the United States. Approximately, 180,000 men are diagnosed each year, and approximately 95 percent of these men have localized disease that is potentially curable. Previously, studies have consistently demonstrated that conventionally fractionated high dose external beam radiation therapy (CRT), consisting of daily treatment for two months, decreases prostate cancer recurrence, and improves metastasis-free survival. Previous studies also demonstrate that moderate hypo-fractionated radiation therapy (HRT), consisting of daily treatment for one month using a larger dose per treatment, provides a similar low risk of recurrence, and may even be lower with HRT than CRT.

To accurately test the hypothesis of a lower risk of recurrence with HRT, a new study led by investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital published in European Urology Focus, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, pooling available data, to assess whether an improved risk of recurrence could be demonstrated using HRT compared with CRT, in addition to assessing the relative impact of these two treatments on bladder and rectal function. Researchers found that the one-month duration HRT, was associated with a significant improvement in recurrence compared to the two-month duration CRT and therefore would be reasonable to consider in men with intermediate risk prostate cancer and who do not have risk factors that could predispose the patient to bladder side effects several years after the treatment is complete.

""Our results provide evidence for clinicians to consider HRT as compared with CRT as a preferred radiation treatment in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and at low risk of other complications,"" stated Trevor Royce, MD, MPH, radiation oncologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and first author of the study. ""Treatment with a shorter course of radiation and higher doses over fewer days may be the preferred approach in appropriately selected patients with localized prostate cancer, reducing treatment time and cost to the patient, and increasing patient convenience and access to treatment.""

Researchers analyzed data from over 5,000 men from three randomized studies comparing HRT with CRT in men with prostate cancer. Of the 5,484 men, 3,553 men, or 64.8 percent had intermediate-risk prostate cancer. HRT as compared with CRT was associated with a significant 13 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence. No significant difference in overall survival was found between HRT and CRT but researchers noted that the possibility exists that men in excellent health could also achieve an overall survival benefit with HRT as compared with CRT.

""Late bladder and urethra toxicities were noted to be higher in the HRT as compared to CRT group which necessitates carefully choosing men who are not at risk for sustaining a late bladder or urethral side effect,"" said Anthony D'Amico, MD, PhD, chief, Genitourinary Radiation Oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and senior author of the study. ""Men to exclude would be those who get up more than three times at night to urinate, or have urgency to urinate, or incontinence, or men who are on anti-coagulants that could increase the risk of bleeding,"" D'Amico said.

Researchers say further study is needed using individual patient-level data among men with high risk prostate cancer to assess the benefit of HRT and whether treatment toxicity, particularly those to the bladder and urinary system are also low with HRT.",0

737,"Hair is an important feature of primate -- including human -- diversity and evolution, serving functions tied to thermoregulation, protection, camouflage and signaling. However, the evolution of wild primate hair remained relatively understudied until recently.

Researchers in the Primate Genomics Lab at the George Washington University examined what factors drive hair variation in a wild population of lemurs known as Indriidae. Specifically, the researchers aimed to assess the impacts of climate, body size and color vision on hair evolution. They found:
• Sifaka lemurs, which are native to Madagascar, have denser hair in dry, open environments. The researchers believe that, like early humans, the lemurs' hair helps protect against the strong rays of the sun.
• Lemurs in colder regions are more likely to have dark hair. This is the first evidence in mammals for a classic pattern in nature called Bogert's Rule, which states that dark colors could aid with thermoregulation as they help absorb heat from the sun's rays.
• Red hair in lemurs is associated with enhanced color vision. According to the researchers, populations that can see a larger range of colors are more likely to have patches of red hair.
• Multiple evolutionary pressures may act on one trait and the strength of their influence may vary between species.

""Human hair evolution remains a mystery, largely because hair does not fossilize,"" Elizabeth Tapanes, lead author on the paper and a postdoctoral scholar at the University of San Diego, California, said. (Tapanes conducted the study while a doctoral student at GW.) ""The lemurs we studied exhibit an upright posture like humans and live in a variety of ecosystems like early humans, so our results provide a unique window into human hair evolution.""

Brenda Bradley, an associate professor of anthropology who directs GW's Primate Genomics Lab and is a co-author on the study, explained our understanding of hair evolution and diversity in other primates helps us fill in the gaps of our own human evolutionary story.

""Most people are intrigued by the diversity of hair on their own bodies, and the variety of hair types among people around the world,"" Bradley said. ""Understanding hair patterns in non-human primates, such as these lemurs, may provide a comparative context for understanding how variation arose in human hair.""

The researchers note future work should focus on samples across smaller geographic or phylogenetic (family-level, genus-level) scales and from diverse non-human and human populations.",0

740,"The first evidence of a genetic link explaining why some people who catch Covid-19 don't become sick has been discovered

A scientific and medical team led by Newcastle University, UK, has demonstrated that the gene, HLA-DRB1*04:01, is found three times as often in people who are asymptomatic. This suggests that people with this gene have some level of protection from severe Covid.

The study, funded by Innovate UK, the UK's innovation agency, compared asymptomatic people to patients from the same community who developed severe Covid but had no underlying illnesses, and is published in the HLA journal.

The study team believe this is the first clear evidence of genetic resistance because this study compared severely affected people with an asymptomatic COVID group and used next generation sequencing to focus in detail and at scale on the HLA genes which are packed together on chromosome 6. Other studies have scanned the whole genome but that approach is less effective in the tissue typing complex.

Genome wide studies can be likened to a satellite image. The high density and complexity of the histocompatibility complex and variation in different populations means significant variation can be overlooked. For example, different alleles or versions of the same gene could have opposite effects on the immune response. This study was much more focused and compared symptomatic to asymptomatic in the same population revealing the ""protective"" qualities of the allele.

It is known that the human leukocyte antigen gene identified, HLA-DRB1*04:01, is directly correlated to latitude and longitude. This means more people in the North and West of Europe are likely to have this gene.

This suggests that populations of European descent will be more likely to remain asymptomatic but still transmit the disease to susceptible populations.

Dr Carlos Echevarria from the Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University who also works as a Respiratory Consultant in the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is a co-author of the paper says: ""This is an important finding as it may explain why some people catch Covid but don't get sick.

""It could lead us to a genetic test which may indicate who we need to prioritise for future vaccinations.""

""At a population level, this is important for us to know because when we have lots of people who are resistant, so they catch Covid but don't show symptoms, then they risk spreading the virus while asymptomatic.""

The effect of genes being linked to geolocation is an accepted scientific concept and it is well known that HLA genes develop over generations in reaction to disease-causing pathogens.

Study author, David Langton, whose company ExplantLab helped fund the study through an Innovate UK research award, added: ""Some of the most interesting findings were the relationships between longitude and latitude and HLA gene frequency. It has long been known that the incidence of multiple sclerosis increases with increasing latitude. This has been put down in part to reduced UV exposure and therefore lower vitamin D levels. We weren't aware, however, that one of the main risk genes for MS, that is DRB1*15:01, directly correlates to latitude.

""This highlights the complex interaction between environment, genetics and disease. We know some HLA genes are vitamin D responsive, and that low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for severe COVID and we are doing further work in this area.""

The study used samples from 49 patients with severe Covid who had been hospitalised with respiratory failure, samples from an asymptomatic group of 69 hospital workers who had tested positive through routine blood antibody testing and a control group from a study into the relationship between HLA genotypes and the outcomes of joint replacement surgery.

The research used next generation sequencing machines to study the different versions, or alleles, of the HLA genes in depth which was combined with a variety of expertise and modelling. The work was limited to samples from North East England during the first lockdown, this reduced variation in the study groups but more studies will be needed in the UK and other populations as there may be different copies of the HLA genes providing resistance in other populations.

The work was a collaboration between Newcastle University, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust as well as the James Cook University Hospital and North Tees and Hartlepool Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Co-author, Professor Sir John Burn, Professor of Clinical Genetics at Newcastle University said: ""SARS Cov-2 is one of the greatest threats Mankind has faced.

757,"A new intraoperative imaging technique, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI), can accurately assess surgical margins during radical prostatectomy, according to a first-in-human research published in the October issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine. The feasibility study showed that 68Ga-PSMA CLI can image the entire excised prostate specimen's surface to detect prostate cancer tissue at the resection margin.

Radical prostatectomy is one of the primary treatment options for men with localized prostate cancer. The goal of a radical prostatectomy is to completely resect the prostate without positive surgical margins. Incomplete removal of the cancer tissue during radical prostatectomy is often associated with poorer patient outcomes, including increased likelihood of recurrence and prostate cancer-related mortality.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as an accurate tool to detect prostate cancer both in primary staging and at time of biochemical recurrence. As PET imaging agents also emit optical photons via a phenomenon called Cerenkov luminescence, researchers sought to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of CLI in detecting prostate cancer.

""Intraoperative radioguidance with CLI may help surgeons in the detection of extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins and lymph node metastases with the aim of increasing surgical precision,"" stated Christopher Darr, PhD, resident at the Department of Urology of the University Medical Center Essen in Essen, Germany. ""The intraoperative use of CLI would allow the examination of the entire prostate surface and provide the surgeon with real-time feedback on the resection margins.""

The single-center study included 10 patients with high-risk primary prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA PET scans were performed followed by radical prostatectomy and intraoperative CLI of the excised prostate. CLI images were analyzed postoperatively to determine regions of interest based on signal intensity, and tumor-to-background ratios were calculated. CLI tumor margin assessment was performed by analyzing elevated signals at the surface of the intact prostate images. To determine accuracy, tumor margin status as detected by CLI was compared to postoperative histopathology.

Tumor cells were successfully detected on the incised prostate CLI images and confirmed by histopathology. Three patients had positive surgical margins, and in two of the patients, elevated signal levels enabled correct identification on CLI. Overall, 25 out of 35 CLI regions of interest proved to visualize tumor signaling according to standard histopathology.

Boris A. Hadaschik, PhD, director of the Clinic for Urology of the University Medical Center Essen, added, ""Radical prostatectomy could achieve significantly higher accuracy and oncological safety, especially in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, through the intraoperative use of radioligands that specifically detect prostate cancer cells. In the future, a targeted resection of lymph node metastases could also be performed in this way. This new imaging combines urologists and nuclear medicine specialists in the local treatment of patients with prostate cancer.""

758,"NIH and VentureWell award teams who develop real solutions to real problems.

The winners of the eight annual Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams (DEBUT) challenge developed simple but effective solutions that can make a significant difference to the patient population, such as a tool to make intubation easier and more accurate and a rapid screening test for C. difficile infections (CDI). The DEBUT challenge, totaling $65,000 in prizes, is supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health, and VentureWell, a non-profit higher-education network that cultivates revolutionary ideas and promising inventions.

DEBUT received 52 applications from 32 universities in 18 states, engaging a total of 250 students this year. NIBIB selected four winning teams for designs that excel according to four criteria: the significance of the problem being addressed; the impact on clinical care; the innovation of the design; and the existence of a working prototype. An additional prize for a project focused on HIV/AIDS was awarded with funds from the NIH Office of AIDS Research. The winning project helps avoid the spread of blood-borne illness such as HIV by preventing scalpel blades from causing lacerations in the operating room. VentureWell selected two more teams based on two additional criteria: market potential and patentability. The prizes will be awarded in a ceremony at the annual Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) conference in Philadelphia on Oct. 17, 2019.

“The DEBUT awards recognize undergraduate student design teams working on challenging healthcare problems that impact millions of people around the world,” said Bruce J. Tromberg, Ph.D., Director of NIBIB. “We are proud to team up with VentureWell and BMES to celebrate these exceptionally talented students and their mentors. Its inspiring to learn about each team’s commitment to make a difference in the lives of patients.”

NIBIB’s first-place prize, renamed this year to Steven H. Krosnick prize, of $20,000 went to In Touch: An Intubation Guidance System. Intubations are often performed by non-expert healthcare workers outside of the operating room such as emergency medical technicians or residents and can fail as often as 49% of the time, which can cause hypoxia, hypotension, and even death. The team from Columbia University, New York City, developed a tool to help make intubation easier by providing the user with feedback that informs them when they are incorrectly pushing the tube into the trachea or esophagus. Limited testing has shown that it significantly decreases the amount of time it takes a novice to correctly intubate, and greatly increases the chance that they will be successful on their first try.

The second place NIBIB award of $15,000 went to a team from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, that developed a rapid screening test called C. Differently to screen for CDI. The current tests for CDI take more than an hour, require a trained lab technician, and are costly. More than 90% of those tests will be negative. C. Differently developed a test that can rule out CDI within five minutes. This could save hospitals and estimated $250 million in unnecessary testing costs. In addition, since it is paper based, portable, and does not require expertise to use, it is significantly cheaper than traditional testing — lowering costs for hospitals and patients.

NIBIB’s third place prize of $10,000 was awarded to a team from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, for their device that helps patients with tracheostomies. A tracheostomy involves cutting an opening in the neck where a tube can be inserted to allow air to go into the trachea and reach the lungs of patients who experience difficulty breathing. While this procedure allows a patient to breathe on his own, it also prevents him from being able to speak since most of the air from the lungs goes out through the tracheostomy tube and cannot drive the vocal cords into vibration. Another major problem is that patients suffer from an excess of mucus buildup in the throat because they are breathing in dry air that has bypassed the normal pathway through the nasal cavity that regulates its humidity. The attachment developed by the students combines a filter that captures humidity (reducing mucus) and a plug that blocks exhalation and enables the patients to speak. It is designed so the patient can switch back and forth easily between the two functions. The device is also re-usable.

The Venture Prize of $15,000 was awarded by VentureWell to The Cath Path, a device that helps women to self-catheterize, designed by a team from Stanford University, California. More than 250,000 women in the United States suffer from neurogenic bladder — a condition in which bladder control is compromised. The solution to this is to use a catheter four to six times a day to void the bladder. However, females often face difficulty locating the urethra and inserting the catheter correctly. This can result in social embarrassment and urinary tract infections. The Cath Path features a vaginal insert that aligns the catheter guide with the urethra and helps women insert the catheter without assistance.

VentureWell’s Design Excellence Prize of $5,000 went to Axexo, an arm exoskeleton developed by a team from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia. Medical arm exoskeletons are used to support a user’s arm against the load of gravity. They can be used for medical reasons, such as stroke patients who need extra support, or by professionals performing delicate or repetitive motions for long periods of time such as doctors. Currently available exoskeletons are either fully supportive or compact, but not both. The Axexo was designed to be compact enough to be worn under a shirt while still supportive enough that the user’s arm feels nearly weightless as they perform tasks.

“This year’s winners have developed compelling solutions addressing a broad range of urgent needs,” said Phil Weilerstein, President of VentureWell. “The DEBUT submissions demonstrated the application of effective design principles and great ingenuity in applying emerging scientific and technological breakthroughs to create innovative solutions that are designed to improve patient safety and meet regulatory requirements.”

759,"Without altering the genetic code in the DNA, epigenetic modifications can change how genes are expressed, affecting an organism's health and development. The once radical idea that such changes in gene expression can be inherited now has a growing body of evidence behind it, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood.

A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz shows how a common type of epigenetic modification can be transmitted via sperm not only from parents to offspring, but to the next generation (""grandoffspring"") as well. This is called ""transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,"" and it may explain how a person's health and development could be influenced by the experiences of his or her parents and grandparents.

The study, published the week of September 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), focused on a particular modification of a histone protein that changes the way DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. This widely studied epigenetic mark (called H3K27me3) is known to turn off or ""repress"" the affected genes and is found in all multicellular animals -- from humans to the nematode worm C. elegans used in this study.

""These results establish a cause-and-effect relationship between sperm-transmitted histone marks and gene expression and development in offspring and grandoffspring,"" said corresponding author Susan Strome, professor emerita of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.

Histones are the main proteins involved in the packaging of DNA in the chromosomes. The epigenetic mark known as H3K27me3 refers to methylation of a particular amino acid in the histone H3. This leads to the DNA being more densely packaged, making the genes in that region less accessible for activation.

The new study involved selectively stripping this histone mark from the chromosomes of C. elegans sperm, which were then used to fertilize eggs with fully marked chromosomes. In the resulting offspring, the researchers observed abnormal gene expression patterns, with genes on the paternal chromosomes (inherited from the sperm) turned on or ""upregulated"" in the absence of the repressive epigenetic mark.

This led to tissues turning on genes they would not normally express. For example, germline tissue (which produces eggs and sperm) turned on genes normally expressed in neurons.

""In all the tissues we analyzed, genes were aberrantly expressed, but different genes were turned up in different tissues, demonstrating that the tissue context determined which genes were upregulated,"" Strome said.

Analysis of the chromosomes in the offspring's germline tissue revealed that the upregulated genes still lacked the repressive histone mark, while the mark had been restored on the genes that were not upregulated.

""In the germline of the offspring, some genes were aberrantly turned on and stayed in the state lacking the repressive mark, while the rest of the genome regained the mark, and that pattern was passed on to the grandoffspring,"" Strome explained. ""We speculate that if this pattern of DNA packaging is maintained in the germline, it could potentially be passed on for numerous generations.""

In the grandoffspring, the researchers observed a range of developmental effects, including some worms that were completely sterile. This mix of outcomes is due to how chromosomes get distributed during the cell divisions that produce sperm and eggs, resulting in many different combinations of chromosomes that can be passed on to the next generation.

Researchers in Strome's lab have been studying epigenetic inheritance in C. elegans for years, and she said this paper represents the culmination of their work in this area. She noted that other researchers studying mammalian cells in culture have reported results very similar to her lab's findings in worms, although those studies did not show transmission across multiple generations.

""This looks like a conserved feature of gene expression and development in animals, not just a weird worm-specific phenomenon,"" she said. ""We can do amazing genetic experiments in C. elegans that can't be done in humans, and the results of our experiments in worms can have broad implications in other organisms.""

The co-first authors of the paper are Kiyomi Kaneshiro, who worked on the study as a graduate student in Strome's lab and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and UCSC research associate Thea Egelhofer. The coauthors also include bioinformaticist Andreas Rechtsteiner and graduate student Chad Cockrum (now at IDEXX Laboratories). This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health.",0

She also encouraged pediatricians to reinforce good hygiene habits with parents, including making sure children stay home if they are sick and that they wash their hands with warm water and soap, as most hand sanitizers are not effective against the germs most often linked to GI outbreaks in kids.

761,"Telehealth companies are helping people achieve long-term weight loss with online programs that combine one-on-one coaching with prescription drugs like Ozempic. Wagner Okasaki/Getty Images
• Telehealth company Calibrate is offering a weight loss program that prescribes a weight loss drug and one-to-one coaching.
• Ozempic is a drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it’s recently grown in popularity as a weight loss tool.
• Experts say it can provide a motivating kickstart for people who are trying to lose weight.
• One-to-one coaching may help people to understand and improve their eating habits, which could lead to weight loss. Shifting unwanted body fat can be difficult for a number of reasons, both physical and mental. On the one hand, you must create a calorie deficit through diet and exercise, and on the other, you’ll need to address unhealthy eating habits and understand why you eat the way you do. A telehealth company has devised a program that claims to help you with both the physical and mental aspects of sustainable weight loss. Calibrate says it takes a multi-pronged approach to weight loss by offering one-to-one coaching sessions with an obesity doctor and a weight loss coach, and prescribing GLP-1s, a kind of medication that’s said to curb cravings and make you feel fuller faster. The medications on offer include brand-name GLP-1s such as Wegovy, Saxenda, Mounjaro, and Ozempic. If the latter name sounds familiar, it’s because it’s been heralded as a weight loss wonder drug and has grown in popularity as a weight loss tool in recent years. Ozempic is a brand name of semaglutide, an injectable drug that is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The company claims that, according to research, combining GLP-1 medications (like Ozempic) with coaching and small lifestyle changes is the “safest and most effective long-term option for weight loss.” Used in tandem, are these methods really a fail-safe weight loss approach?

How the combination of counseling and medication helps with weight loss “Initially, this drug was devised for people with type 2 diabetes as it regulates your blood sugar levels,” says Anne Iarchy, a weight loss and healthy lifestyle coach. “It was never intended to be a weight loss drug.” Ozempic works by lowering your blood sugar levels after eating. It stimulates the same effect of insulin secretion in a healthy person. “Your blood sugar levels after a meal are reduced, which then makes you feel full. And when you feel full, you don’t have any craving for food,” Iarchy explains. As well as improving satiety, there are claims that the drug makes certain foods repulsive as well. This is said to be down to the body’s insulin reaction, which causes you to crave different foods. So, is combining Ozempic and one-to-one coaching an effective recipe for consistent and sustainable weight loss? Iarchy believes that the drug may be a good starting point for some. “Obese people who have tried many diets before can easily get disheartened if they don’t see results immediately. Their mindset has been shot over the years of trying, and sometimes a boost with a certain drug can help you get over that first hurdle,” she says. While Iarchy says she hasn’t heard that the drug makes food taste terrible, she does worry that it could encourage people into the habit of relying on drugs without taking ownership of their own behavior and lifestyle.

Beyond medication: how 1-on-1 coaching can improve long-term results Iarchy says she believes that, combined with prescription medications, coaching is a good addition to the Calibrate program if it’s done properly. “Coaching has to encompass education on nutrition, awareness around current habits and patterns, and a reset of someone’s mindset around food, exercise, and lifestyle,” she surmises. For Iarchy, addressing why people overeat, why they eat certain foods, and what they need to do to change is crucial for long-term results. With the convenience of grabbing processed foods, Iarchy says Calibrate would need to educate their members on what a healthy meal looks likes and how they can prepare it during these sessions. “The meds do come with quite a lot of potential side effects, so that has to be taken into consideration as well,” Iarchy adds. Among the possible side effects are fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Add to that, if the drug really does ruin your enjoyment of food, there is a risk that it could lead to disordered eating. Losing interest in the foods you normally love – or being able to only eat a few bites of them – could create an unhealthy and unsatisfying relationship with food that could do more harm than good in the long run. Shaheen-Zaffar, a coach and counselor, says this is a potential risk with any weight loss drug. But adds that, the emotional support you receive through one-to-one coaching may help you with these challenges. “[Coaching] can help you identify if that is happening and allow you to raise your concerns,” she notes. Like Iarchy, Shaheen-Zaffar believes that drugs like Ozempic can act as a kickstart, and provide motivation while people begin to heal their relationship with food through coaching or counseling.

Medication without counseling may make long-term weight loss more challenging Having tried the drug herself several years ago, Shaheen-Zaffar can attest to the fact that it can cause weight loss. However, she notes that she regained weight as she wasn’t exploring the emotional reasons she had gained weight in the first place. “There was no emotional or nutritional support at the time, and so I went back to the same old habits,” she explains. Weight loss aside, there are also concerns that the increased demand for the drug is causing shortages for people who rely on it to manage type 2 diabetes. The FDA has reported intermittent supply disruptions of semaglutide injectables, which it expects to continue until at least January 2023. So, there is also a moral quandary to consider when selecting a program like this.",0
762,"NIH and Prostate Cancer Foundation launch large study on aggressive prostate cancer in African-American men

The largest coordinated research effort to study biological and non-biological factors associated with aggressive prostate cancer in African-American men has begun. The $26.5 million study is called RESPOND, or Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Tumor Markers, and Social Stress. It will investigate environmental and genetic factors related to aggressiveness of prostate cancer in African-American men to better understand why they disproportionally experience aggressive disease — that is, disease that grows and spreads quickly — compared with men of other racial and ethnic groups.

RESPOND is supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), both parts of the National Institutes of Health, as well as by the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF). The NCI funding will be provided from the 21st Century Cures Cancer Moonshot Initiative.

“Understanding why African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer than men of other racial and ethnic groups is a critical, unanswered question in cancer disparities research,” said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. “This large, collaborative study can help the cancer research community better understand and address these disparities.”

African-American men have about a 15 percent chance of developing prostate cancer in their lifetimes, compared to about a 10 percent chance for white men, and African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive disease. In addition, the risk of dying from prostate cancer for African-American men is about 4 percent compared to about 2 percent for white men. With the RESPOND study, researchers aim to learn more about why these disparities exist.

“This study, which is combining state-of-the-art molecular approaches with social and environmental science, will help unravel the complex interactions of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to excess prostate cancer burden and poorer outcomes in African-American men, allowing development of tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in this population,” said NIMHD Director Eliseo Pérez-Stable, M.D.

The investigators aim to enroll 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer into the RESPOND study. The participants will be identified primarily via NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer Registries. In addition, this study builds on years of research collaboration involving investigators who are part of the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. These investigators will contribute additional information and samples from 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer. In accordance with NIH data sharing policies, and with appropriate informed consent, the de-identified data and samples collected as part of this research will be made available as a resource to the scientific community, aiding future research.

Investigators in the study will examine possible associations between aggressive disease and exposures to neighborhood/environmental stressors such as discrimination, early-life adversity, and segregation. They will also study DNA and tumor samples to identify gene variants associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Once researchers have identified genetic changes associated with aggressive prostate cancer, they will investigate how the social environment interacts with those genetic changes.

“Previous research on prostate cancer disparities has investigated social and genetic factors separately, but we know these components interact with each other to contribute to disparities,” said Damali Martin, Ph.D., program director for the study in NCI’s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program. “The ability to integrate genetic and environmental factors, including individual, neighborhood, and societal factors, into one large study will enable us to have a better understanding of how all of these factors contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.”

RESPOND, a cooperative agreement, will be led by Christopher Haiman, Sc.D., of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, in collaboration with John Carpten, Ph.D., Ann Hamilton, Ph.D., and David Conti, Ph.D., also of USC; Scarlett Gomez, Ph.D., of the University of California, San Francisco; Tamara Lotan, M.D., of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; and Franklin Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics will perform genotyping, and the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University will conduct DNA sequencing for the genetic component of the study. NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences is administering the study grant.

“No group in the world is hit harder by prostate cancer than men of African descent, and, to date, little is known about the biological reasons for these disparities, or the full impact of environmental factors,” said Jonathan W. Simons, M.D., PCF’s president and CEO. “We celebrate our partnership and applaud NIH for spearheading this study, which we believe will help pave the way for groundbreaking discoveries that will improve health equity for African-American men and their families.”

763,"Cleveland Clinic Awarded $3 Million NIH Grant to Determine Disease-Modifying Effects of Exercise in Parkinson’s Patients The study is designed to measure the impact of long-term, high-intensity aerobic exercise

The National Institutes of Health has awarded Cleveland Clinic researcher Jay Alberts, Ph.D, a 5-year, $3 million grant to conduct a multi-site clinical trial to study the long-term effects of aerobic exercise on slowing the progression of Parkinson’s disease.

Jay Alberts, Ph.D., is vice-chair of innovation in the Neurological Institute and a staff member in Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute Department of Biomedical Engineering. Alberts is the principal investigator on the CYCLE trial (“CYClical Lower Extremity Exercise for Parkinson’s trial”).

The new study aims to determine if long-term, high-intensity aerobic exercise can slow the advancement of Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurological disease. To date, no surgical or pharmacological intervention has been effective in slowing the disease’s course. This project will be the first long-term investigation of the potential for aerobic exercise to arrest disease progression.

“Our previous work clearly indicates that aerobic exercise, such as cycling, in a controlled laboratory environment improves motor function over the course of eight weeks,” said Alberts. “This project is important in understanding how exercise can slow disease progression and the translation of a laboratory-based protocol to the home of the patient. To bring an effective intervention from the Cleveland Clinic to the home of a patient outside of our zip code is an exciting next step in the treatment of Parkinson’s.”

Cleveland Clinic and University of Utah will recruit 250 Parkinson’s patients who will be randomized to a high-intensity home exercise or usual and customary care (UCC) group. CYCLE’s exercise group will utilize indoor cycling bikes from fitness technology company Peloton. Participants will be instructed to exercise 3x/week for 12 months; the UCC group will be instructed to engage in their normal activities. The exercise and control groups will undergo identical motor and non-motor evaluation protocols at enrollment, 6, and 12 months.

Overall activity levels will be monitored for both groups via a wearable device. Exercise performance data will be used to determine if there is an optimal exercise dose necessary to slow disease progression. Identifying a necessary exercise dose will provide clinicians with more specific recommendations for Parkinson’s disease patients and provides patients an opportunity to play a more active role in the treatment of this disease.

This research will build upon previous work done by Alberts and his team. They recently completed a 100-person in-laboratory randomized clinical trial and results showed an 8-week high-intensity aerobic exercise program significantly improved global motor function and specific aspects of walking and cognitive function in patients with Parkinson’s. These positive outcomes provide strong rationale to evaluate effectiveness of a long-term CYCLE protocol in a home-based setting to impact a greater number of people with Parkinson’s disease.",0

766,"The correct cuff size can help people who monitor their blood pressure from home. Siro Rodenas Cortes/Getty Images
• Researchers report that an incorrect cuff size on blood pressure monitoring devices can provide inaccurate readings.
• This can result in unnecessary medication prescriptions as well as lack of treatment.
• The issue can affect people who get their blood pressure checked at a doctor’s office as well as someone who takes their own readings at home. If you think one-size-fits-all doesn’t work very well in clothing, scientists want you to know that it doesn’t work when it comes to your blood pressure readings. They say a wrong cuff size could get you a false reading. That means your doctor might prescribe too much or too little medication for you. It could also mean your high blood pressure goes untreated. That’s the preliminary conclusion of a released March 1 during the American Heart Association’s Epidemiology, Prevention, Lifestyle & Cardiometabolic Health Conference 2022 in Chicago. The information could be important for millions of people, especially those who take their blood pressure readings at home. A found that nearly half of adults in the United States have high blood pressure (hypertension). That’s defined by the top or systolic number being 130 mm Hg or greater and the diastolic or bottom number being 80 mm Hg or higher. In addition, in 2019, more than half a million deaths in the United States had hypertension as a primary or contributing cause.

What sets this research apart The authors of the new study say what’s different about their findings is that researchers used automatic blood pressure measuring devices, the kind you often find in your doctor’s office, or you may be using at home. “It has even more implications for people who want to do blood pressure monitoring at home. Blood pressure devices you purchase at a pharmacy or online come with one cuff size. And many people don’t realize how important it is to get a cuff size that’s the right size for your arm,” said Dr. Tammy McLoughlin Brady, vice chair for clinical research in the Department of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland as well as the medical director of the Pediatric Hypertension Program at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. “If you need an extra-large cuff, you would need to find select devices because they don’t come with an extra-large cuff, or you have to pay almost twice the amount to get an extra-large cuff to fit your arm,” Brady told Healthline. The study researchers analyzed blood pressure readings of 165 adults in Baltimore. In a single setting, they compared the average of three readings using a regular adult-sized cuff versus the readings from a cuff appropriately sized for their arms. They found that the individuals who needed an extra-large cuff had a reading of 143/86 when a regular-sized cuff was used. That reading falls in the range of the diagnosis of stage two hypertension. However, with an appropriately sized cuff, that reading averaged 124/79, which is in the standard range. “In our study, the overestimation of blood pressure due to using a cuff that is too small misclassified 39 percent of participants as being hypertensive,” Brady said. “While the underestimation of blood pressure due to using a cuff that is too large missed 22 percent of participants with hypertension.”

Getting the right reading The American Heart Association recommends using a tape measure around the bicep at mid-arm to get the right measurements. Then compare those numbers against their chart to find what size cuff you should be using. Brady also says the device you’re using should have been tested and approved for accuracy. You can check for a list of those devices at https://www.validatebp.org/ or https://www.stridebp.org/. There are also steps you need to follow before and while you are measuring your blood pressure. Here are 10 tips to get a more accurate reading:
• Use the right size cuff.
• Don’t put the cuff over your clothing.
• Relax for 3 to 5 minutes before taking your reading.
• Sit in a comfortable chair. Don’t dangle your feet, be sure to uncross your legs, and make sure your back and arm are supported.
• Try not to be tense or stressed.
• Don’t smoke for at least 30 minutes before.
• Avoid alcohol and caffeine for at least 30 minutes before.
• Don’t sit in a cold room. Being in the cold could increase your blood pressure reading.
• Go to the bathroom before. A full bladder increases your blood pressure.",0

• A recent study found that a key tool for reading blood oxygen can give inaccurate readings for Black and Hispanic patients.
• Pulse oximeters are placed on a person’s finger and can help monitor how oxygenated their blood is.
• These pulse oximeter readings can be key for monitoring people with COVID-19. New research has found that pulse oximetry readings — a tool used to measure blood oxygen saturation levels and guide treatment options for COVID-19 — have been less accurate in Black, Asian and Hispanic patients. The , recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine, also found that Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to experience delayed or unrecognized eligibility for COVID-19 treatments. The findings add to previous research suggesting that inaccurate pulse oximeter readings are more common among Black and Hispanic people, which can lead to life-threatening delays in treatment. consistently shows that Black and Hispanic people are more likely to be hospitalized and die from COVID-19. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued that pulse oximeters may be less accurate in people with dark skin pigmentation. “This and other studies show that pulse oximeter readings in persons with more pigmented skin can be lower than the readings of those with lighter skin. So, both providers and persons using pulse oximeter at home and for treatment interventions need to be aware of this difference when using this data,” says Dr. Laura Vaughan, an internal medicine physician and clinical assistant professor of primary care medicine and population health at Stanford Medicine.

Pulse oximeter inaccuracies are more likely in non-white patients The researchers evaluated the health data of 1,216 patients with oxygen saturation levels measured by two different tests — pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas — and found that oxygen levels were often overestimated among Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients. Black patients’ oxygen saturation levels were overestimated by 1.2 percent compared to white patients. Hispanic patients’ levels were overestimated by 1.1 percent and Asian patients by 1.7 percent. Black and Hispanic patients were also 29 percent and 23 percent less likely to be recognized for treatment eligibility compared to white patients. The researchers also analyzed the data of over 6,500 patients with COVID-19 and, based on their findings, predicted that over 1,900 patients’ oxygen saturation levels were likely overestimated, leading to delays and failures in life-saving treatments. “This study’s results suggest that for critical treatment decisions that rely on arterial oxygen saturation, use of pulse oximetry may be inadequate and produce opportunities for undertreatment and overtreatment irrespective of the patient’s race or ethnicity,” the researchers stated in the study. A published last year in JAMA Network Open found that inaccuracies in pulse oximeter readings increase the risk of death in Black patients. Another study, published in Anesthesia & Analgesia, similarly found that pulse oximetry overestimates oxygen levels in people with darker skin pigmentation compared to those with lighter skin pigmentation.

Pulse oximeters — a device placed on a patient’s finger — are used to measure the amount of oxygen in red blood cells in emergency situations. “Oxygen saturation gives information about the amount of oxygen carried in the blood. The pulse oximeter can estimate the amount of oxygen in the blood without having to draw a blood sample,” says Dr. Geraldine Finlay, a pulmonologist and senior deputy editor for Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at UpToDate at Wolters Kluwer, Health. With COVID, oxygen levels are often the first sign of a downturn, according to Vaughan. Many patients with COVID-19 experience low oxygen levels, which is a that can cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, and a fast pulse. Some patients with low oxygen levels, or hypoxemia, may remain asymptomatic, which can lead to rapid deterioration, according to Finlay. COVID-19 patients with low oxygen levels should start oxygen therapy to boost their oxygen saturation to at least 90 percent, according to the . Pulse oximetry has also been used to inform whether patients should begin more aggressive therapies, like the antiviral remdesivir or the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which were routinely given to patients with low oxygen levels during the pandemic. “Some of the current hospital treatments guidelines use oxygen saturation to determine offering these treatments. Also, a delay in recognizing this decline can lead to delays in these treatments,” says Vaughan.",0
770,"A study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found the natural decline in lung function over a 10-year period was slower among former smokers with a diet high in tomatoes and fruits, especially apples, suggesting certain components in these foods might help restore lung damage caused by smoking.

The researchers found that adults who on average ate more than two tomatoes or more than three portions of fresh fruit a day had a slower decline in lung function compared to those who ate less than one tomato or less than one portion of fruit a day, respectively. The researchers inquired about other dietary sources such as dishes and processed foods containing fruits and vegetables (e.g. tomato sauce) but the protective effect was only observed in fresh fruit and vegetables.

The paper, which is part of the Ageing Lungs in European Cohorts (ALEC) Study, funded by the European Commission and led by Imperial College London, also found a slower decline in lung function among all adults, including those who had never or had stopped smoking, with the highest tomato consumption. Poor lung function has been linked with mortality risks from all diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, and lung cancer.

The findings appear in the December issue of the European Respiratory Journal.

""This study shows that diet might help repair lung damage in people who have stopped smoking. It also suggests that a diet rich in fruits can slow down the lung's natural aging process even if you have never smoked,"" says Vanessa Garcia-Larsen, assistant professor in the Bloomberg School's Department of International Health and the study's lead author. ""The findings support the need for dietary recommendations, especially for people at risk of developing respiratory diseases such as COPD.""

For the study, the research team assessed diet and lung function of more than 650 adults in 2002, and then repeated lung function tests on the same group of participants 10 years later. Participants from three European countries -- Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom -- completed questionnaires assessing their diets and overall nutritional intake. They also underwent spirometry, a procedure that measures the capacity of lungs to take in oxygen.

The test collects two standard measurements of lung function: Forced Exhaled Volume in 1 second (FEV1), which measures how much air a person can expel from their lungs in one second; and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), the total amount of air a person can inhale in 6 seconds. The study controlled for factors such as age, height, sex, body mass index (an indicator of obesity), socio-economic status, physical activity and total energy intake.

Among former smokers, the diet-lung-function connection was even more striking. Ex-smokers who ate a diet high in tomatoes and fruits had around 80 ml slower decline over the ten-year period. This suggests that nutrients in their diets are helping to repair damage done by smoking.

""Lung function starts to decline at around age 30 at variable speed depending on the general and specific health of individuals,"" explains Garcia-Larsen ""Our study suggests that eating more fruits on a regular basis can help attenuate the decline as people age, and might even help repair damage caused by smoking. Diet could become one way of combating rising diagnosis of COPD around the world.""",0

775,"Telehealth has been used to help people with opioid misuse disorder. Oleksii Syrotkin/Getty Images
• The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has announced proposed changes that would increase the availability of telehealth and at-home treatment for those who are part of opioid treatment programs.
• Experts say that these changes, while valuable, are part of a larger shift that is needed as the country struggles under the weight of an overdose epidemic.
• Telehealth, while improving health outcomes for some, also brings forward questions about its availability, particularly in rural and marginalized communities. The Biden administration has put forward changes to nationwide regulations that would widen the availability of certain treatments for opioid use disorder via telehealth, according to a US Department Health and Human Services (HHS) announcement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts the number of deaths due to an overdose in 2021 at over 107,000. Dr. Jonathan Watanabe (PhD, PharmD) of the University of California-Irvine, who served on the White House-sponsored committee on improving access to methadone says that healthcare systems are struggling as cases mount and that this isn’t a new problem. Watanabe said it is vital to ensure more people can access treatment for drug misuse. “If anything, we need to relax rules from what they were just to meet the past epidemic, we certainly have to get more bold and more flexible in treating patients with opioid use disorder now that it’s gotten worse. And so I think that’s why a lot of these measures that are being described [by the HHS] , they just really have to occur if you want to make a difference.”

New push to make addiction treatment easier to access Rules around telehealth medical appointments were relaxed during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to allow more patients to get care without having to go into a physician’s office. An August 2022 published in JAMA Psychiatry found that people getting treatment for substance misuse benefitted greatly from telehealth appointments. They found that people getting via telehealth were 27% more likely to stay on medication for opioid misuse. They had about a 33% decreased risk of having an overdose during the study period. The proposed changes from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) include:
• Expanding the definition of an [opioid treatment program] practitioner to include any provider who is appropriately licensed to dispense and/or prescribe approved medications.
• adding evidence-based delivery models of care which would include split dosing, telehealth and harm reduction activities.
• strengthening the patient-practitioner relationship through the promotion of shared and evidence-based decision-making.
• updating criteria for provision of take-home doses of methadone; The extended supply availability of medications like methadone and buprenorphine, and their availability via telehealth appointments, would formalize guidance published in 2020. The changes are open for public comment until Feb. 14.

Telehealth can help, but only if people have access Experts say that the changes around telehealth medical appointments could help many with substance misuse disorder, but that many people may not get access to these programs. Dr. Katherine Hirchak (PhD, MHPA) of Washington State University, whose research and work is centered on American Indigenous communities, says that healthcare policymakers and providers need to make sure that they’re not prescribing urban solutions to issues facing rural communities, especially when it comes to internet availability. “[It means] thinking about how to invest in the necessary infrastructure around that to increase internet access, or other ways of being able to receive that care, which I think is really important and needed in rural areas. So, really wanting to make sure that we don’t increase structural racism or other issues around access, and [not] just sort of taking the blueprint of what works in more urban areas and trying to apply it to rural areas.” Watanabe says that telehealth and an expansion of the treatment options that could be provided by nurses and pharmacists came to the forefront when COVID-19 impacted the ability for patients to participate in opioid treatment programs (OTPs.) “That was a big challenge with the OTPs in the pandemic. People had to go in every day, so waiting in line with a whole bunch of people, when there’s shelter-in-place order is not very wise in terms of anybody’s safety. So, I think that’s where a lot of these things started to resonate…providing care is actually dangerous when you think of pandemic spread.”

Dr. Joseph Garbely (DO), who teaches at both Drexel and Penn. State, while also sitting on the board of directors of the American Society of Addictions Medicine, says that privacy and legal barriers also lead to concerns as telehealth access is expanded. “The system that you’re going to be using for telehealth, is it HIPAA and 42 CFR compliant? Because we cannot violate either of those federal laws when it comes to our patients and we really need to make sure that we have the ability to reach patients in a cogent and safe way.” Garbely is one of a number of experts who spoke to Healthline for this story who believe that the proposed removal of the X waiver (a federal rule that limits who can prescribe buprenorphine) will also expand access for those seeking addiction treatment. The hope is that this will be done by expanding the number of professionals who can provide much-needed medication more people can access treatment. The removal of the waiver was included in the omnibus spending bill passed at the end of last year.

Hirchak says that while telehealth expansion is promising when it comes to medications for opioid use disorder it’s imperative to reduce stigma while providing culturally informed care.



“Telehealth has been really helpful in continuing needed care, but it may not address all of the issues around that. And so just continuing to think that through, making sure that we continue to address stigma around [medications for opioid use disorder ] both at the patient-relative level as well as the prescriber provider and community levels [is important].” In that vein, SAMHSA’s proposed changes include eliminating stigmatizing language such as detoxification. For Watanabe, everyone involved in addictions treatment in the United States needs to work from a place that prioritizes reducing these social barriers. “We need to embrace de-stigmatization in all circles.”",0

785,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Over the past two years Mayo Clinic’s Florida campus has erupted with substantial growth in major construction projects and new staff to serve a fast-growing patient population, especially those who require complex medical care. During this time, Mayo Clinic has invested more than $300 million in major construction projects and added 900 new staff as it advances its status as the premier destination medical center in the Southeast. Mayo Clinic’s Florida campus now has about 5,900 employees and contributes roughly $2 billion to the Florida economy.

As part of this economic boom, Mayo Clinic today announced another major construction project on its Florida campus – an investment of $70.5 million to add four floors for a total of five to Mayo Building South and remodel existing space in the Davis Building. The project will add 80,000 new square feet and renovate 40,000 existing square feet. With completion expected in 2019, the building expansion will provide:
• Expansion of the spine center and pain rehabilitation programs
• Space and equipment to establish a molecular imaging center for radiology

“To solidify our position as the premier destination medical center in the Southeast, we plan to recruit the brightest people, significantly expand our space, and continuously improve our technology to enhance our ability to deliver the highest quality of care for our patients,” says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., vice president, Mayo Clinic, and CEO of Mayo Clinic in Florida.

A $25 million gift from the family of Dan and Brenda Davis of Jacksonville helped spur the next phase of the expansion. The family’s gift will support the Mayo Building South construction and the recruitment of world-renowned physicians and researchers.

“We are extremely grateful to the family of Dan and Brenda Davis for their generous and unyielding support for Mayo Clinic,” Dr. Farrugia says. “The history of Mayo Clinic in Florida is enshrined and made possible by the incredible generosity of generations of the Davis families.”

Over the next five years, Mayo Clinic’s Florida campus will add about 300,000 square feet of space and hundreds of additional new staff, including more than 100 physicians.

In preparation for this new expansive growth, Mayo Clinic is working with the North Florida Transportation Planning Organization and Florida Department of Transportation on improvements for traffic around the campus.

“We are seeing tremendous growth in recruiting outstanding academic medical personnel and adding much needed space for our staff to work and care for patients,” Dr. Farrugia says. “As we grow, we will double our capacity to care for patients of all ages. That’s why it is important for patients to know that 85 percent of all commercial insurance plans are accepted at Mayo Clinic’s Florida campus.”

Mayo Clinic already has begun constructing an innovative destination medical building that will provide integrated services needed for complex cancer, as well as neurologic and neurosurgical care. Initially rising four stories, the 150,000-square-foot building has the potential for 11 more stories. The building is expected to be completed in 2018.

Another major construction project underway on Mayo’s Florida campus is a state-of-the-art positron emission tomography (PET) radiochemistry facility. The facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018, will house a radiochemistry laboratory and a cyclotron – a particle accelerator important in the production of radiopharmaceuticals. The facility will produce Mayo-developed Choline C-11 used in certain PET scans. The scans are the latest advancements in imaging tests that light up prostate cancer wherever it is found and provide targets for therapy. Locating recurrent prostate cancer sooner may enable Mayo physicians to target the cancer more quickly, before it spreads further. This allows for more effective treatment. The cyclotron also will produce other radiopharmaceuticals to image a variety of organs and develop the next generation of imaging techniques.

Also, Mayo Clinic and United Therapeutics Corporation are collaborating to construct a three-story, 75,000 square-feet building that houses technology that will increase the volume of lungs for transplantation significantly by preserving selected marginal donor lungs and making them viable for transplantation. Then, the lungs will be made available to patients at Mayo Clinic and other transplant centers throughout the U.S. The organizations also will work together on regenerative medicine research — a game-changing area of medicine with the potential to heal damaged tissues and organs. The building also will house a biotechnology center aimed at attracting new companies to Northeast Florida. Construction is expected to be completed in 2019.

“For health care to reach its full potential, we have to discover, translate and apply new solutions,” Dr. Farrugia says. “We must bring together talented and curious minds from health care and all kinds of industries to nurture an environment that encourages collaboration and innovation.”

797,"Missing crucial doses of medicines and vaccines could become a thing of the past thanks to Rice University bioengineers' next-level technology for making time-released drugs.

""This is a huge problem in the treatment of chronic disease,"" said Kevin McHugh, corresponding author of a study about the technology published online in Advanced Materials. ""It's estimated that 50% of people don't take their medications correctly. With this, you'd give them one shot, and they'd be all set for the next couple of months.""

When patients fail to take prescription medicine or take it incorrectly, the costs can be staggering. The annual toll in the United States alone has been estimated at more than 100,000 deaths, up to 25% of hospitalizations and more than $100 billion in healthcare costs.

Encapsulating medicine in microparticles that dissolve and release drugs over time isn't a new idea. But McHugh and graduate student Tyler Graf used 21st-century methods to develop next-level encapsulation technology that is far more versatile than its forerunners.

Dubbed PULSED (short for Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs), the technology employs high-resolution 3D printing and soft lithography to produce arrays of more than 300 nontoxic, biodegradable cylinders that are small enough to be injected with standard hypodermic needles.

The cylinders are made of a polymer called PLGA that's widely used in clinical medical treatment. McHugh and Graf demonstrated four methods of loading the microcylinders with drugs, and showed they could tweak the PLGA recipe to vary how quickly the particles dissolved and released the drugs -- from as little as 10 days to almost five weeks. They also developed a fast and easy method for sealing the cylinders, a critical step to demonstrate the technology is both scalable and capable of addressing a major hurdle in time-release drug delivery.

""The thing we're trying to overcome is 'first-order release,'"" McHugh said, referring to the uneven dosing that's characteristic with current methods of drug encapsulation. ""The common pattern is for a lot of the drug to be released early, on day one. And then on day 10, you might get 10 times less than you got on day one.

""If there's a huge therapeutic window, then releasing 10 times less on day 10 might still be OK, but that's rarely the case,"" McHugh said. ""Most of the time it's really problematic, either because the day-one dose brings you close to toxicity or because getting 10 times less -- or even four or five times less -- at later time points isn't enough to be effective.""

In many cases, it would be ideal for patients to have the same amount of a drug in their systems throughout treatment. McHugh said PULSED can be tailored for that kind of release profile, and it also could be used in other ways.

""Our motivation for this particular project actually came from the vaccine space,"" he said. ""In vaccination, you often need multiple doses spread out over the course of months. That's really difficult to do in low- and middle-income countries because of health care accessibility issues. The idea was, 'What if we made particles that exhibit pulsatile release?' And we hypothesized that this core-shell structure -- where you'd have the vaccine in a pocket inside a biodegradable polymer shell -- could both produce that kind of all-or-nothing release event and provide a reliable way to set the delayed timing of the release.""

Though PULSED hasn't yet been tested for months-long release delays, McHugh said previous studies from other labs have shown PLGA capsules can be formulated to release drugs as much as six months after injection.

In their study, Graf and McHugh showed they could make and load particles with diameters ranging from 400 microns to 100 microns. McHugh said this size enables particles to stay where they are injected until they dissolve, which could be useful for delivering large or continuous doses of one or more drugs at a specific location, like a cancerous tumor.

""For toxic cancer chemotherapies, you'd love to have the poison concentrated in the tumor and not in the rest of the body,"" he said. ""People have done that experimentally, injecting soluble drugs into tumors. But then the question is how long is it going to take for that to diffuse out.

""Our microparticles will stay where you put them,"" McHugh said. ""The idea is to make chemotherapy more effective and reduce its side effects by delivering a prolonged, concentrated dose of the drugs exactly where they're needed.""

The crucial discovery of the contactless sealing method happened partly by chance. McHugh said previous studies had explored the use of PLGA microparticles for time-released drug encapsulation, but sealing large numbers of particles had proven so difficult that the cost of production was considered impractical for many applications.

While exploring alternative sealing methods, Graf noticed that trying to seal the microparticles by dipping them into different melted polymers was not giving the desired outcome. ""Eventually, I questioned whether dipping the microparticles into a liquid polymer was even necessary,"" said Graf, who proceeded to suspend the PLGA microparticles above a hot plate, enabling the top of the particles to melt and to self-seal while the bottom of the particles remained intact, ""Those first particle batches barely sealed, but seeing the process was possible was very exciting.""Further optimization and experimentation resulted in consistent and robust sealing of the cylinders, which eventually proved to be one of the easier steps in making the time-released drug capsules. Each 22x14 array of cylinders was about the size of a postage stamp, and Graf made them atop glass microscope slides.

After loading an array with drugs, Graf said he would suspend it about a millimeter or so above the hot plate for a short time. ""I'd just flip it over and rest it on two other glass slides, one on either end, and set a timer for however long it would take to seal. It just takes a few seconds.""

809,"The most common head and neck cancer -- oral squamous cell carcinoma -- often starts off, as many other cancers do, quite innocently. Perhaps as a little white patch in the mouth or a small red bump on the gums. Easy to ignore, to downplay. But then something changes, and the little blotch becomes more ominous, starts growing, burrowing into connective tissue.

Patients who are lucky enough to see a dentist before things take a nasty turn have a shot at being able to prevent the lesions from turning cancerous -- or can at least make sure treatment starts when it's most effective. But for those who aren't that lucky, the outlook can be bleak: the five-year survival rate of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is around 66 percent. More than 10,000 Americans die of oral cancer every year; smokers and drinkers are hardest hit.

Now, researchers at Boston University's Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine have found that dialing back -- or even genetically deleting -- a protein that seems to spur the cancer's growth might help limit a tumor's development and spread. They say their findings make the protein, an enzyme called lysine-specific demethylase 1, a potential ""druggable target"" -- something that doctors could aim chemo and immuno-oncology therapies at to take down a tumor. The study was published in Februaryin Molecular Cancer Research.

Given that at least one-third of Americans don't visit a dentist regularly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the discovery could be a future lifesaver for those who miss out on preventative care.

""These findings have significant implications for new and potentially more effective therapies for oral cancer patients,"" says Manish V. Bais, a lead author on the study and SDM assistant professor of translational dental medicine. ""This study is an important step toward the development of novel groundbreaking therapies to treat oral cancer.""

Maria Kukuruzinska, SDM's associate dean for research and a coauthor on the study, says it was rare in the past for dental schools to be diving into the science behind head and neck cancers, with most of the research happening in cancer centers. But that's changing and ""dental schools have an advantage over traditional cancer centers when it comes to investigating the science behind the development of OSCC,"" she says, ""because we can get access to premalignant lesions, where cancer centers basically just see patients who are presenting with fully developed disease.""

Once OSCC takes hold, says Bais, there's little chance of eliminating it completely. Clinicians can try chemotherapy and radiotherapy, even cutting out a tumor. ""But there is no cure -- you can shrink the tumor, but not eliminate it,"" Bais says.

In previous research, Bais had found that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) -- an enzyme that typically plays a crucial role in normal cell and embryo development -- goes out of control, or is ""inappropriately upregulated,"" in a range of cancers, including in the head and neck, as well as those in the brain, esophagus, liver, and lung.

""The expression of this enzyme goes up with each tumor stage,"" says Bais, who's also a member of BU's Center for Multiscale & Translational Mechanobiology. ""The worse the tumor, the higher the expression of this protein.""

In his lab, Bais began testing what would happen to tumors in the tongue if LSD1 was blocked. To restrict the enzyme, the researchers either knocked it out -- by manipulating genes so LSD1 is effectively switched off -- or used a type of drug called a small molecule inhibitor, which enters a cell and impedes its normal function. Already in clinical trials for treating other cancers, small molecule inhibitors haven't previously been tested against oral cancer. Bais found that disrupting LSD1 curbed the tumor's growth.

""The aggressiveness, or bad behavior, of the tumor went down,"" he says. ""We found that when we inhibit this protein, it promotes anti-tumor immunity -- our body tries to fight by itself.""

But LSD1 isn't the only troublemaker in the tumor: when it's upregulated, it messes with a cell communication process -- the Hippo signaling pathway-YAP -- that normally helps control organ growth and tissue regeneration. Bais says YAP, LSD1, and a couple of other proteins then get stuck in a vicious cycle, each one pushing the other into increasingly aggressive and harmful moves. ""We need to break this cycle,"" says Bais.

To find a new way of doing that, the researchers coupled the effort to inhibit LSD1 by targeting YAP with a different inhibitor, a drug called verteporfin. Originally developed to help treat serious eye conditions like macular degeneration, verteporfin is being tested by other researchers as a potential cancer treatment, including in ovarian cancer. The combination proved effective, according to Bais. He also threw a third drug into the mix. Bais says using the LSD1 inhibitor in combination with a common immunotherapy drug that helps white blood cells in the immune system kill cancer cells -- an immune checkpoint inhibitor called anti-Programmed Death 1 ligand antibody -- ""showed a favorable response.""

""Our findings provide a basis for future clinical studies based on the inhibition of LSD1, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents to treat oral cancer in humans,"" he says. The work was recently boosted with a new $2.6 million National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research grant. ""Although our studies are preclinical, restricted to mice and some human tissue, we want to expand to look at human clinical trial samples.""

According to Kukuruzinska, Bais' focus on the biology of oral cancer may also help make the development of other future treatments more efficient.

""People get very excited when you have a drug that may show some positive preliminary results, but very frequently, these studies move forward to humans, cost billions of dollars, and then eventually fail,"" says Kukuruzinska, who's also director of SDM's predoctoral research program and a professor of translational dental medicine. ""If you really understand what pathways, what cell processes are impacted by these inhibitors, then it allows you to predict in advance whether something is going to be successful in human patients.""

At BU, the dental school has a teaching clinic on site and shares a campus with the BU School of Medicine and its primary teaching hospital, Boston Medical Center. It's also home to BU's Head & Neck Cancer Program -- which pairs basic science researchers with clinicians to look at the underlying mechanisms of oral cancers -- and Center for Oral Diseases, a multidisciplinary clinical-research collaborative.

""So, we can think about disease interception,"" says Kukuruzinska. ""And perhaps think about preventing the tumor from happening.""

With access to a clinic -- as well as head and neck surgeons from the neighboring hospital -- researchers like Bais can test any new treatments and approaches on human tissue samples.

""It's a holy grail,"" Kukuruzinska says of the human samples. ""We can interrogate them for responses to small molecule inhibitors, by capturing tumor slices and trying to treat them with different inhibitors to see the response.""

Eventually, it could also open the door to personalized, precision medicine, with researchers trialing different therapies on tissue from individual patients. ""And then it will predict whether this person can be treated with this study,"" says Kukuruzinska. ""This is something we really want to develop.""

With students involved in many of the research projects -- three were coauthors on Bais' paper and another, Thabet Alhousami (SDM'22), was a lead author -- it means future dentists produced at BU will head into the clinic with a sharper eye for potential malicious bumps and blotches.

""They will be able to say, 'This is precancerous or cancerous' -- it will impact their diagnoses,"" says Bais. ""Then, in terms of therapy, because they're now aware of what can work, what immunotherapy can work, they can make specific reference to where patients should go next. It can improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment in the long term.""",0

811,"Camryn Colahan, a senior at Vermillion High School in Vermillion, Ohio, overcame major medical obstacles to return to playing competitive sports. Colahan will be honored with the Cleveland Clinic Sports Medicine Courage Award during the 21st Greater Cleveland Sports Awards presented by Medical Mutual and Ancora on Thursday, March 4, 2021, aired on WKYC TV 3, wkyc.com and SportsTime Ohio.

As a freshman, Colahan had lettered in varsity volleyball, basketball and track. In 2018, as a sophomore, she was beginning her fourth year on a national level Junior Olympic Volleyball team when Colahan discovered a lump on her inner thigh.

The lump started to cause her some discomfort. Immediately following her sectional championship volleyball match, she was taken to Cleveland Clinic Children’s for testing, including an MRI and biopsy. Colahan, who was 15 years old at the time, was diagnosed with Stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of soft-tissue cancer.

In the days following her diagnosis, the Colahan family met with doctors at Cleveland Clinic Children’s, who put together a treatment plan that included intensive chemotherapy for 10 months and intensive proton beam radiation therapy.

While she was still able to attend school during treatment, she was not able to participate in any sports because of fatigue and the time commitment for chemotherapy.

By mid-March of 2019, Colahan started to experience second and third-degree burns from the radiation. During the last few weeks of treatment, she needed the assistance of a wheelchair to aide with movement due to her wounds.

“So many of our patients are such incredible fighters, but what makes Cam stand out is that she makes her fight look easy, “said Stacey Zahler, D.O., Cleveland Clinic Children’s pediatric hematologist-oncologist. “She has treated cancer like a match against the toughest volleyball team – with such strength and determination, but yet, simultaneously with such grace and poise. She does not complain. She always has her game face on, and she perseveres.”

She began physical therapy in November 2019 to strengthen her coordination and footwork due to side effects from radiation, including significant skin and muscle damage.

“It was very frustrating during the season because I was not even close to being as good as I was the season before,” says Colahan. “I still managed to go to practice every day and work my hardest to get back. Running was a challenge because of how weak my body had become. To put it in perspective, I only played 30 seconds of our first game and I was exhausted.”

See the video of Colahan’s come-back basketball shot.

In January 2021, Colahan’s family shared she had completed her maintenance treatment and her scans continue to show no evidence of disease. Colahan completed nearly two years of chemotherapy.

“As I’ve gone through all of this, I have realized what life is about,” said Colahan. “It’s not about how many followers you have on Instagram, it’s all about how you think of things and knowing that you shouldn’t take anything for granted. Anything can be taken from you at any point. Enjoy every moment you have, and surround yourself with people that you love and make you happy.”

Colahan lives with Brett and Aimee, her parents, and her three siblings. She is on the varsity volleyball and basketball teams. Colahan recently committed to play on the women’s volleyball team at Wittenberg University and plans to study psychology.

826,"Taking Vitamin D supplements during pregnancy could substantially reduce the chances of babies up to a year old suffering from atopic eczema, according to a new study by University of Southampton researchers.

The research, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, revealed that babies had a lower risk of developing atopic eczema in their first year if their mothers took 1000 international units (IU) of Vitamin D a day from when they were 14 weeks pregnant until they delivered. The effect was particularly seen in babies who were later breastfed for more than a month.

Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory condition that can have a large impact on sufferers, their families, and healthcare. It is estimated that one in six children aged one to five has atopic eczema, and there has been a global rise over recent decades.

The study at the University of Southampton Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Centre and the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre is the first randomised, controlled trial to show evidence of reduced risk of atopic eczema in infants of mothers who took Vitamin D supplements during pregnancy. More than 700 pregnant women took part in the research -- with 352 taking the supplements from 14 weeks until they gave birth and 351 taking a placebo.

The eczema research was part of the UK Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS) and was led by Professor Keith Godfrey, working with Dr Sarah El-Heis, who was first author of the paper.

Dr El-Heis said: ""Our aim was to see whether taking 1000IU of Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) as a supplement during pregnancy would decrease the risk of atopic eczema in babies. We also wanted to establish whether breastfeeding had any effect on this.

""Our results showed that babies of mothers who received supplements had a lower chance of having atopic eczema at 12 months, which supports recommendations for Vitamin D supplements to be routine during pregnancy.

""We found no effect at 24 and 48 months suggesting that other postnatal influences might become more important beyond infancy or that the babies themselves might also need to be supplemented during the postnatal period for a sustained effect.""

The MAVIDOS study also recently reported that taking the Vitamin D supplement during pregnancy also had lasting benefits for the child's bone density at four-years-old.

Professor Godfrey commented: ""We know that Vitamin D can affect the immune system and the proteins that make up our skin. We were interested to know if Vitamin D supplements taken by pregnant women would have an impact on their child's risk of atopic eczema.

""Our findings showed a positive effect, which was more evident in infants that breastfed. This may reflect supplementation during pregnancy increasing the amount of Vitamin D in breast milk.""",0
830,"Three decades of responding to infectious disease outbreaks

Soon after his appointment in 1984 as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., testified before Congress showing a world map annotated with a single emerging infectious disease threat, HIV/AIDS. Since then, diseases and pathogens including chikungunya, H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile, Ebola and Zika viruses were added, providing a powerful visual reminder of the enduring need to anticipate, detect and manage new and emerging infectious diseases around the globe. In an essay in Annals of Internal Medicine published online today, Dr. Fauci reflects on the ways efforts have been marshalled to address infectious disease outbreaks of the past three decades.

Initial responses to a newly recognized disease, now known as HIV/AIDS, in the early 1980s were criticized as being too slow, the essay notes. “The insidious emergence of HIV/AIDS and the lack of due attention by policymakers illustrate how some outbreaks that start subtly can grow to global proportions if they are not aggressively addressed early on,” Dr. Fauci writes. Between the early 1980s and the early 1990s, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research increased markedly, reaching $1 billion by the end of 1992. The accelerated government response supported both research and research infrastructure, and yielded advances in countering the HIV/AIDS pandemic domestically and internationally. Ultimately, notes Dr. Fauci, sustained support for scientific research coupled with political and community engagement helped transform HIV/AIDS from a nearly universally fatal disease to a condition that can be managed with appropriate treatment.

In contrast to HIV/AIDS, when outbreaks of respiratory diseases caused by SARS coronavirus and influenza viruses have occurred, they generated immediate widespread public attention and prompted concerted responses by presidential administrations and the Congress. For example, the 2009 influenza pandemic began in April and an experimental vaccine entered clinical trials by August. However, despite intense efforts to test and manufacture the new vaccine, adequate supplies to protect the broad U.S. population were not available until early winter, after the outbreak had peaked. “This experience,” writes Dr. Fauci, “served as a striking reminder of the inadequacy of our pandemic preparedness capabilities and underscored the need, now being actively pursued, to develop platform technologies that can be applied rapidly to develop vaccines for evolving outbreaks.”

The essay also considers how presidential administrations have responded to the appearance of pathogens ranging from West Nile virus and Ebola to, most recently, the arrival of Zika virus in the Americas. “Leadership at the NIAID has learned many valuable lessons through experiences during the prior administrations with regard to optimal responses to such outbreaks,” Dr. Fauci concludes. “It is critical to apply these lessons to the infectious disease threats that we will inevitably face in the current administration and beyond.”

832,"The lungs are one of the last organs to undergo full maturation in a baby's body. Children that are born very prematurely do not have fully developed lungs, and are therefore more susceptible to associated complications. The most common of these is a chronic lung disease known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which mainly occurs when the (immature) newborns require mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation.* The disease is characterized by a lack of fully developed alveoli and small blood vessels that support them. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand and makes breathing more difficult, effects which can be clinically measured.

""To date, there has been very little understanding of what exactly causes BPD,"" says Dr. Prajakta Oak, scientist at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center and Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD) at the Helmholtz Zentrum München. ""Alongside damage caused by mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity**, characteristic inflammatory processes and the functional and structural immaturity of the lungs are considered to underlie the disease,"" the lead author of the current study explains.

The starting point for the research was a genetic association study involving a total of 1,061 neonates, 492 of whom had been diagnosed with BPD. It revealed that certain mutations in the gene for PDGFR-α (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha) significantly increased the risk of developing the disease. That stands to reason, as the cells in the lung tissue that produce PDGFR-α are involved in the formation of the alveoli and in the development of lung structure. The scientists were also able to confirm these genetic anomalies in cells isolated from the lungs of affected children and to link them to lowered production of this molecule and respective functional consequences.

""In a model system that has only been established at a few locations worldwide, we were then able to show that lowered production of PDGFR-α combined with mechanical ventilation led to the typical symptoms of BPD,"" explains research team leader Dr. Anne Hilgendorff from the ILBD. ""These included lower blood vessel density and defective septation in the lung as well as a higher rate of apoptosis."" The researchers associated these findings with a lower production in VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), an important vascular growth factor. However, the researchers succeeded in decreasing the symptoms in the experimental model of the disease by artificially increasing signal transmission via PDGFR-α.

In further experiments, the researchers also demonstrated that the TGF-ß (transforming growth factor beta) signaling molecule plays a role in the development of BPD by decreasing production of PDGFR-α. The scientists presume that the messenger substance TGF-ß is released particularly frequently due to injury to the lung caused during mechanical ventilation.

""For the first time, we show in an experimental model and in cells of premature patients that there is a link between BPD and the decreased production of a key growth factor, namely PDGFR-α,"" Dr. Hilgendorff says, putting the results into context. BPD may be genetically determined, but it can also be caused or worsened by effects of the inflammatory process. ""Next we would like to examine even more closely whether we can target interventions into this signaling pathway and thus open up the way for potential therapies.""

* Although mechanical ventilation is often vital, it can damage the lungs and cause inflammation, resulting in the chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is also known as neonatal chronic lung disease (nCLD). The symptoms of this disease can persist into adulthood, thereby increasing the risk of an earlier reduction in lung capacity or the development of chronic lung diseases in later life such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

840,"NIH taps Dr. Lindsey Criswell as director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases

National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., has selected Lindsey A. Criswell, M.D., M.P.H., D.Sc., as director of NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). A rheumatologist, Dr. Criswell is currently the vice chancellor of research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She is a professor of rheumatology in UCSF’s Department of Medicine, as well as a professor of orofacial sciences in its School of Dentistry. She is expected to begin her new role as the NIAMS director in early 2021. She will succeed long-time director Stephen I. Katz, M.D., Ph.D., who passed away suddenly in December 2018.

“Dr. Criswell has rich experience as a clinician, researcher and administrator. Her ability to oversee the research program of one of the country’s top research-intensive medical schools, and her expertise in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, make her well-positioned to direct NIAMS,” said Dr. Collins. “I look forward to having her join the NIH leadership team early next year. I also want to thank Robert H. Carter, M.D., for his exemplary work as the acting director of NIAMS since December 2018.”

As NIAMS director, Dr. Criswell will oversee the institute’s annual budget of nearly $625 million, which supports research into the causes, treatment and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. The institute advances health through biomedical and behavioral research, research training and dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases.

The NIAMS Division of Extramural Research supports scientific studies and research training and career development throughout the country through grants and contracts to research organizations in fields that include rheumatology, muscle biology, orthopaedics, bone and mineral metabolism and dermatology. NIAMS-supported research addresses some of the most common and disabling chronic diseases that affect almost every household in America.

Dr. Criswell has been a principal investigator on multiple NIH grants since 1994 and has published more than 200 peer-reviewed journal papers. Her research focuses on the genetics and epidemiology of human autoimmune disease, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Using genome-wide association and other genetic studies, her research team contributed to the identification of more than 30 genes linked to these disorders.

Dr. Criswell’s many honors include the Kenneth H. Fye, M.D., endowed chair in rheumatology and the Jean S. Engleman Distinguished Professorship in Rheumatology at UCSF, and the Henry Kunkel Young Investigator Award from the American College of Rheumatology. She also received UCSF’s 2014 Resident Clinical and Translational Research Mentor of the Year. During her career, she has mentored some four dozen students (high school through medical/graduate school), medical residents, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty.

Dr. Criswell earned a bachelor’s degree in genetics and a master’s degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley; a D.Sc. in genetic epidemiology from the Netherlands Institute for Health Sciences, Rotterdam; and an M.D. from UCSF. In addition to completing a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in rheumatology, she is certified as a first responder in wilderness medicine.

843,"The National Institutes of Health and partners have launched a large clinical trial to assess whether an experimental HIV vaccine regimen is safe and able to prevent HIV infection. The new Phase 2b proof-of-concept study, called Imbokodo, aims to enroll 2,600 HIV-negative women in sub-Saharan Africa. Of 1.8 million new HIV infections worldwide in 2016, 43 percent occurred in eastern and southern Africa, with women and girls disproportionately affected.

“Imbokodo,” the Zulu word for rock, is part of a well-known proverb in South Africa that refers to the strength of women and their importance in the community. The study is sponsored by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention, B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, with co-funding from two primary partners, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

The vaccine regimen being tested in Imbokodo is based on “mosaic” immunogens — vaccine components designed to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains. This regimen differs from the one being tested in the Phase 2b/3 HVTN 702 study, an ongoing HIV vaccine efficacy trial sponsored by NIAID that launched late last year in South Africa with major co-funding from NIAID and BMGF. HVTN 702 is evaluating a newer version of the vaccine regimen tested in the RV144 Thai trial — the only candidate HIV vaccine regimen ever shown to provide some protection against the virus.

“Together with the implementation of existing HIV prevention and treatment strategies, the development and delivery of a preventive HIV vaccine that is safe and at least moderately effective would help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “We are committed to pursuing multiple vaccine development strategies to achieve this goal.”

The first Imbokodo participants have received vaccinations at clinical research sites in South Africa. Regulatory approvals are being sought to conduct the study at additional sites in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. With the start of Imbokodo, two HIV vaccine efficacy trials now are taking place in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from HVTN 702, which is enrolling HIV-negative men and women in South Africa, are expected in late 2020. Results from Imbokodo are expected in 2021.

“Both Imbokodo and HVTN 702 have resulted from years of scientific testing and clinical development, and they represent science’s current best efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent HIV infection,” said Kathy Mngadi, M.B.Ch.B., M.Phil., senior scientist at the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) and Imbokodo co-chair. “We are grateful to the people of southern Africa who volunteer for these trials, and the communities in which the trials are conducted to help develop what could be a true game-changer for the HIV/AIDS pandemic.”

The NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), headquartered at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, is implementing Imbokodo. The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) is helping implement the study in South Africa. Additional partners providing support include the U.S. Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity, and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard.

NIAID provided funding for preclinical and early phase clinical development of the mosaic-based vaccine, which was initially developed by the laboratory of Dan H. Barouch, M.D., Ph.D., at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, together with Janssen and other partners. The mosaic immunogens incorporated in the vaccine were designed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

In preclinical studies, regimens with mosaic-based vaccines protected monkeys against infection with an HIV-like virus. Findings from two early-stage human clinical trials suggest that these vaccines are well-tolerated and can generate anti-HIV immune responses in healthy adult volunteers. Based on results from an early-stage clinical trial called APPROACH, reported in July 2017, as well as findings from a second early-stage trial called TRAVERSE, researchers selected a lead candidate regimen for further evaluation.

Data from TRAVERSE confirmed the decision to move forward with the larger trial to evaluate whether the experimental regimen can prevent HIV infection. The ongoing TRAVERSE study is comparing two regimens containing vaccines that use a strain of common-cold virus engineered so that it does not cause illness (adenovirus serotype 26, or Ad26) to deliver either three (trivalent) or four (quadrivalent) mosaic antigens among 198 healthy, HIV-negative adult volunteers in the United States and Rwanda. Interim data indicate that both are well-tolerated and can elicit anti-HIV immune responses. Imbokodo is evaluating the quadrivalent vaccine.

All Imbokodo participants will receive vaccinations at four timepoints over one year. They will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine regimen or placebo. The experimental regimen includes four doses of the quadrivalent mosaic vaccine. The final two doses will be given together with doses of an HIV protein, clade C gp140, and an aluminum phosphate adjuvant to boost immune responses. Participants will be followed for at least two years.

844,"While many scientists are trying to prevent the onset of a cancer defense mechanism known as autophagy, researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center are leveraging it in a new therapy that causes the process to culminate in cell death rather than survival. The novel treatment strategy targets the p62 protein, which is often referred to as the ""Trash Man"" due to its role in disposing unwanted cellular proteins during autophagy. Results from preclinical experiments suggest this experimental treatment approach could be particularly effective against multiple myeloma and potentially other forms of blood cancers.

Cancer therapies cause unwanted proteins to accumulate in cancer cells, which can trigger a form of cell suicide known as apoptosis. To survive, the cells break down the excess proteins through autophagy, from a Greek term meaning ""self eating."" In a study recently published in the journal Molecular and Cellular Biology, scientists induced autophagy using the anti-tumor drug obatoclax while simultaneously blocking the production of p62 using a drug known as a cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK) inhibitor. Several experiments involving animal models and cultured multiple myeloma cells demonstrated that blocking p62 disrupted autophagy and killed far more cancer cells than administering the anti-cancer agents alone.

""Therapies that are designed to block the early stages of autophagy do not offer the possibility of exploiting its potentially lethal effects,"" says Steven Grant, M.D., Shirley Carter Olsson and Sture Gordon Olsson Chair in Cancer Research, associate director for translational research and program co-leader of Developmental Therapeutics at VCU Massey Cancer Center. ""Our strategy turns autophagy from a protective process into a toxic one, and these results suggest it could increase the effectiveness of a variety of cancer therapies that induce autophagy.""

Critical to the success of this therapy is Bik, a protein that plays a significant role in governing cell death and survival. During cancer treatments, Bik accumulates in cancer cells until it triggers apoptosis. Normally, the cancer cells would induce autophagy and p62 would rid the cells of Bik by loading the proteins into degradation chambers known as auotophagosomes for disposal. However, blocking p62 production results in an inefficient form of autophagy and the accumulation of Bik eventually causes the cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.

This research builds upon more than a decade of work by members of Grant's laboratory investigating novel treatment strategies and combination therapies that selectively kill multiple myeloma and other blood cancer cells. The technology in his study has been made available for licensing through the VCU Office of Research.

""We are now working to identify additional CDK inhibitors that can be used to disrupt autophagy,"" says Grant. ""The ultimate goal will be to translate these findings into a clinical trial to test the therapy in patients with various blood cancers.""",0
845,"In a first-of-its-kind study, research from the University of Vermont Cancer Center has linked phthalates, commonly called the ""everywhere chemical,"" to higher incidence of specific childhood cancers. \

Phthalates are chemical additives used to enhance the durability or consistency of plastics and a wide range of consumer products. Humans are routinely exposed to these compounds when they leach out of the products and into the environment. They are also used as inactive ingredients in some medications, especially those that require extended or delayed drug release to work properly, for example, some anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics.

The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggests that exposure to medication-associated phthalates may contribute to the development of some childhood cancers, and that minimizing exposure to phthalates may help prevent some childhood cancers in the future.

The study measured the association between gestational and childhood phthalate exposures and childhood cancer incidence. Lead investigator Thomas Ahern, PhD, MPH, an associate professor at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine, teamed with colleagues at Aarhus University and Odense University Hospital in Denmark. Using data from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the Danish Medicines Agency, and the Danish Cancer Registry, all supported by the country's universal healthcare system, investigators studied all live births between 1997 and 2017, totaling nearly 1.3 million children.

Among the 2,027 cases of childhood cancer, researchers measured associations between gestational and childhood phthalate exposure and the incidence of specific cancers.

Childhood, but not gestational (in utero) phthalate exposure was associated with 20% higher rate of childhood cancer overall, with a nearly three-fold higher rate of osteosarcoma diagnosis, a bone cancer, and a two-fold higher rate of lymphoma diagnosis, cancer of the blood.

""These results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that these ubiquitous chemicals have a negative impact on human health,"" said Ahern.

""Our study characterized phthalate exposure based on prescription fills for phthalate-containing medications. While such exposures are typically much higher magnitude than what we would call 'background' environmental exposure, our findings warrant concern,"" he said.

Fellow Cancer Center member, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) fellow, and UVM Larner College of Medicine professor Frances Carr, PhD, notes that phthalates are now recognized endocrine disruptors because they interfere with hormonal systems and may affect thyroid function. ""Although more studies are needed, exposure to phthalates has been linked to thyroid, breast, and other solid tumors. Phthalates, like other plasticizers such as bisphenol A (BPA), are ubiquitous in the environment; age of exposure, as well as chronic low dose exposures, are significant risk factors for adverse health effects,"" said Carr.

""While no direct correlation has been made between phthalates in our region and increased cancer risk, this study highlights the importance of environmental exposures and their relationship to cancer risk,"" said UVM Cancer Center director Randall Holcombe, MD, MBA. The study's authors suggest that future research will explore which specific phthalate (or combination of phthalates) poses the greatest risk, and by what mechanism(s) phthalates might drive risk of osteosarcoma and lymphoma. ""Ultimately, research like this will lead to a better understanding of how to mitigate the risks of environmental phthalates,"" said Holcombe.",0
846,"A single high dose of radiation that can be delivered directly to the tumour within a few minutes is a safe and effective technique for treating men with low risk prostate cancer, according to a study presented at the ESTRO 38 conference.

Radiotherapy traditionally involves a series of lower dose treatments that take place over several days or week. The new treatment is called high dose-rate brachytherapy and it delivers radiation via a set of tiny tubes.

Researchers say this technique could offer an effective treatment that is convenient for patients and brings potential time and cost savings for hospitals.

The research was presented by Dr Hannah Tharmalingam, a Clinical Research Fellow at Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Northwood, and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.

She said: ""Brachytherapy, where we use temporary catheters to directly treat tumours, has already proved to be a good treatment for prostate cancer, both in terms of killing the cancer cells and minimising side effects. This usually means patients make four to six visits to the hospital for a series of lower dose treatments. We wanted to see whether we could get similar results but with just one high dose treatment, saving time for the patient and the hospital.""

The research included 441 men with prostate cancer who were treated at one of seven UK hospitals between 2013 and 2018. Their cancers were classified, depending on how likely they were to spread, as either low risk (total of 44 men), medium risk (285 men) or high risk (112 men). All were treated with a single high dose (19 Gy) of radiation; 166 men also received hormone therapy but none had any surgery or chemotherapy.

Researchers monitored the men's progress for an average of 26 months. They measured the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the men's blood two years after the treatment and again three years after the treatment. PSA is considered to be a good indicator of how well prostate cancer treatment has worked. If levels increase, this can indicate the cancer has returned.

Overall, after two years, 94% of men showed no sign of the cancer returning, according to their PSA levels. For men with low risk cancer this figure was 100%, in men with medium risk it was 95% and in men with high risk cancer it was 92%. After three years, the overall figure was 88%, and in men with low, medium and high risk cancers, the figures were 100%, 86% and 75% respectively.

Of the 27 men with raised PSA levels, researchers were able to identify where the cancer had returned in 25. In 15, the cancer had returned in the prostate. In the rest, it had spread to other parts of the body.

At the time of the treatment, there were no serious side effects. Later on, two men developed urethral strictures that required surgery and two developed rectal fistulae that required colostomy.

Dr Tharmalingam said: ""These results indicate that high dose-rate brachytherapy is a safe and effective treatment for men with low risk prostate cancer but further research is needed in medium and high risk patients to see if the results can be improved with a higher dose. This type of treatment offers an attractive alternative to surgery or other forms of radiotherapy as it has a comparatively low risk of side effects. It is also a patient-friendly option because the treatment can be given quickly at a single hospital visit.""

Dr Tharmalingam and her colleagues hope to continue studying the impact of using this type of radiotherapy, especially in patients with higher risk prostate cancer who are more likely to suffer a recurrence. She believes it would be possible, given the low risk of side effects, to modify the treatment or increase the dose even further in higher risk cases.

Dr Bradley Pieters, chair of ESTRO's brachytherapy committee and a radiation oncologist at the Academic University Medical Centers, The Netherlands, who was not involved in the study, said: ""This research suggests that a single treatment of high dose-rate brachytherapy could be a very good option for many men with prostate cancer. The technology and expertise needed to deliver this treatment is not yet available in all cancer centres. However, given that it may offer time and money savings for hospitals as well as benefits to patients, there is a good argument for investing in this type of radiotherapy.""",0

851,"Study beefs up support for brain cells that control protein hunger

Have you ever found yourself craving a steak or a burger? The brain controls our feelings of hunger and also determines the types of nutrients we should be seeking out. Not much is understood about the brain’s regulation of nutrient-specific hunger, but in a new study published in Science, researchers identified the brain cells in fruit flies that regulate protein hunger and were able to control those cells, affecting what the animals ate. The study, was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.

To study protein hunger, a team of researchers led by Mark Wu, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, starved flies of yeast (the animal’s protein source) for one week. Afterwards, they discovered that the flies ate more yeast and less sugar than flies that ate a control diet.

“Flies have been a great model system for brain research so we can learn a lot about how our own brain circuits work by peeking inside the heads of flies,” said Janet He, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS. “A better understanding of the basic mechanisms that regulate the consumption of different nutrients may help to provide clues to addressing the obesity epidemic.”

Using novel genetic tools, Dr. Wu’s team identified a specific circuit, a set of brain cells that communicate with one another, which controls protein-seeking behavior. When the circuit was stimulated, flies ate more yeast than normal. In contrast, when the researchers turned off the circuit, the flies ate less yeast. The cells in the circuit were more active, which was demonstrated by increased firing activity, when the flies were starved of yeast. Turning the circuit on or off did not affect the animals’ general hunger or thirst.

The researchers also discovered that the circuit serves dual functions in regulating feeding. Following protein starvation, this circuit promotes protein feeding and also simultaneously suppresses sugar intake. One branch of the circuit is activated when the flies are deprived of protein, leading them to seek more protein and increase their consumption of that nutrient. Meanwhile, the other branch of the circuit acts to reduce interest in eating sugar when the flies are protein-starved.

When Dr. Wu and his colleagues closely examined the brain circuit during protein starvation, they discovered structural changes in the brain cells, but only in the branch controlling protein hunger. Some of the changes included elongated processes and an increased number of active zones, which are the sites where brain cells release chemicals to communicate with their neighbors. The part of the circuit regulating sugar intake did not show any changes. These findings suggest that the structural changes in the protein branch of the circuit are responsible for the long-lasting increase in protein-seeking behavior.

“Adult flies usually have a sweet tooth, but when they are starved of protein, the brain makes it a priority to find this nutrient. Once they finally get some protein, the blockade on sugar feeding lifts but the flies still continue to be interested in eating protein,” said Dr. Wu. “In this way, the circuit we identified promotes a single-minded focus on eating protein when the animal is protein-starved, but also allows for more flexible eating patterns with a continued preference for protein, when the need for protein is less.”

Dr. Wu and his team are now trying to identify specific molecules involved in regulating protein hunger and plan to examine protein-specific hunger in mammals. They noted that this research may eventually have implications for obesity research, because the amount of protein in the diet significantly affects caloric intake.

856,"Cigarette smoking is overwhelmingly the main cause of lung cancer, yet only a minority of smokers develop the disease. A study led by scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and published online today in Nature Genetics suggests that some smokers may have robust mechanisms that protect them from lung cancer by limiting mutations. The findings could help identify those smokers who face an increased risk for the disease and therefore warrant especially close monitoring.

""This may prove to be an important step toward the prevention and early detection of lung cancer risk and away from the current herculean efforts needed to battle late-stage disease, where the majority of health expenditures and misery occur,"" said Simon Spivack, M.D., M.P.H., a co-senior author of the study, professor of medicine, of epidemiology & population health, and of genetics at Einstein, and a pulmonologist at Montefiore Health System.

It's long been assumed that smoking leads to lung cancer by triggering DNA mutations in normal lung cells. ""But that could never be proven until our study, since there was no way to accurately quantify mutations in normal cells,"" said Jan Vijg, Ph.D., a study co-senior author and professor and chair of genetics, professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences, and the Lola and Saul Kramer Chair in Molecular Genetics at Einstein (also at the Center for Single-Cell Omics, Jiaotong University School of Medicine in Shanghai, China). Dr. Vijg overcame that obstacle a few years ago by developing an improved method for sequencing the entire genomes of individual cells.

Single-cell whole-genome sequencing methods can introduce sequencing errors that are hard to distinguish from true mutations -- a serious flaw when analyzing cells containing rare and random mutations. Dr. Vijg solved this problem by developing a new sequencing technique called single-cell multiple displacement amplification (SCMDA). As reported in Nature Methods in 2017, this method accounts for and reduces sequencing errors.

The Einstein researchers used SCMDA to compare the mutational landscape of normal lung epithelial cells (i.e., cells lining the lung) from two types of people: 14 never-smokers, ages 11 to 86; and 19 smokers, ages 44 to 81, who had smoked a maximum of 116 pack years. (One pack year of smoking equals 1 pack of cigarettes smoked per day for one year.) The cells were collected from patients who were undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnostic tests unrelated to cancer. ""These lung cells survive for years, even decades, and thus can accumulate mutations with both age and smoking,"" said Dr. Spivack. ""Of all the lung's cell types, these are among the most likely to become cancerous.""

The researchers found that mutations (single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions) accumulated in the lung cells of non-smokers as they age -- and that significantly more mutations were found in the lung cells of the smokers. ""This experimentally confirms that smoking increases lung cancer risk by increasing the frequency of mutations, as previously hypothesized,"" said Dr. Spivack. ""This is likely one reason why so few non-smokers get lung cancer, while 10% to 20% of lifelong smokers do.""

Another finding from the study: The number of cell mutations detected in lung cells increased in a straight line with the number of pack years of smoking -- and, presumably, the risk for lung cancer increased as well. But interestingly, the rise in cell mutations halted after 23 pack years of exposure.

""The heaviest smokers did not have the highest mutation burden,"" said Dr. Spivack. ""Our data suggest that these individuals may have survived for so long in spite of their heavy smoking because they managed to suppress further mutation accumulation. This leveling off of mutations could stem from these people having very proficient systems for repairing DNA damage or detoxifying cigarette smoke.""

The finding has led to a new research direction. ""We now wish to develop new assays that can measure someone's capacity for DNA repair or detoxification, which could offer a new way to assess one's risk for lung cancer,"" said Dr. Vijg.

The study is titled, ""Single-cell analysis of somatic mutations in human bronchial epithelial cells in relation to aging and smoking.""

• Lifestyle habits are what people are most likely to be dishonest about.
• Gen Zers topped the chart as the generation that’s telling the most fibs to healthcare professionals. There’s something about being at the doctor’s office that ignites the urge to lie and withhold the truth. According to one study of over 1,000 patients, 77% of them admitted to lying about their health either directly or by omission when interacting with a healthcare professional. And certain generations tend to fib more than others. Gen Zers led the way, with 93% admitting to lying to healthcare professionals, especially about their sexual histories. “Gen Zers are so nervous when going to the doctor for fear of judgment,” Dr. Eric Ascher, family medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital, told Healthline. Next in line for being dishonest were: Interestingly, each generation lied about different things. Millennials were most likely to lie about their exercise habits. This may be due to the fact that this generation grew up during a time when going to workout facilities became popular, said Ascher. “Working out became trendy as opposed to only being healthy. People were always conscious about weight, but this group gets most embarrassed,” he said. Gen Xers tended to be dishonest about their alcohol consumption, while Baby Boomers told the most lies about their eating habits. Sometimes this is due to people underestimating or ballparking their consumption to avoid uncomfortable conversations, said Melissa Murphey, DNP, APRN, and nurse practitioner in Chicago. “They also may lack confidence in revealing their vulnerabilities or may underestimate the negative impacts associated with certain dangerous behavior,” she told Healthline.

Why do people lie about their health? Fear of judgment was the top reason respondents said they lie to healthcare professionals. Other reasons were: “Patients get embarrassed or oftentimes wait till the end of the visit or the next visit to open up to their provider once they feel comfortable in the doctor-patient relationship,” he said. Murphey agreed. She said many patients need to develop a rapport with their practitioner before disclosing personal information. “[Still,] it is disappointing that people would risk their healthcare outcomes due to [this.]. Healthcare professionals, regardless of their position, should be extra diligent in helping to establish comfortable rapport as quickly as possible with their patients.” Of the 23% of patients who were completely honest with healthcare providers, 64% said they didn’t always feel heard. “If you do not feel heard, it is likely that is not the provider for you. You should always feel heard and not rushed when seeing your doctor,” said Ascher.

Telehealth sessions allow for more lies Overall, patients were most likely to be dishonest with practitioners in telehealth settings. “Oftentimes throughout the pandemic, patients sought out telehealth in situations where they needed urgent care or where they met a provider for the first time. It is likely the patient did not have a relationship with the provider which probably led to fibbing,” said Ascher. “My return patients who utilize telehealth likely do not lie because we have already broken the ice.” Because telehealth provides access to many people who are limited by transportation restrictions or other logical factors, Murphey said these visits need to still be an option. However, if in-person visits with a healthcare provider are possible, she said that’s still the best option. “The remote setting can lend some psychological distance between the patient and practitioner,” she said. While practitioners need to be more vigilant in creating a genuine rapport during patient interaction, patients can aim to treat telehealth visits like in-person visits.

Doctors ask questions to treat, not judge During medical visits, Ascher said people don’t want to be “parented” by their provider regarding information they already know. For instance, he said most patients know that too much alcohol, take-out food, limited exercise, and not eating a lot of vegetables are not ideal, but he still has to ask about these habits. “I do not ask these questions so patients feel any less than human; I ask so I know if there is any advice I can offer, and even more importantly, if there are any reasons I should order an additional blood test or if a medication is warranted [and] which to stay away from,” he said. Gathering the information might also allow him to better match symptoms with lifestyle change suggestions. For example, if a person sees him for acid reflux but rounds down on their alcohol consumption, he may not be able to offer them the proper counseling or testing. If someone notifies him that they are sad, depressed, anxious, or having trouble with focus and sleep but rounds down their alcohol consumption, he may not be able to offer suggestions that could make a difference. If someone has multiple sexual partners, there are testing routines and medications he could recommend that might help keep them healthy. “I never ask patients personal questions to be nosy or intrusive, and we ask a ton of questions on your first visit, but this allows me to tailor appropriate care to you, to keep you healthy,” said Ascher. While providers ask these questions, Murphey noted that they are trained to consider a patient’s mental well-being and respect their emotional vulnerability. “We want our patients to be successful in achieving their healthcare goals, and understanding the full picture provides us the needed information in developing our plan of care,” she said. If you’re afraid to share information because of embarrassment, Ascher said healthcare providers have heard and seen it all. “Nothing is ‘TMI.’ We were trained for this. A good doctor will tailor the care they deliver to you to make you feel seen and heard,” he said. Finding that doctor should be your prerogative, he added. If you feel judged by your provider and don’t feel comfortable being open and honest with them, then the relationship isn’t working, and your health is at risk. “Sometimes finding a good primary care provider is like dating. You have to find one that you connect with,” said Ascher.",0
858,"Over the years, everyone loses a few brain cells. A study led by scientists from USC Stem Cell and the USC Neurorestoration Center presents evidence that adults can replenish at least some of what they've lost by generating new brain cells, and that this process is dramatically altered in patients with long-term epilepsy. The findings are published in Nature Neuroscience.

""Our study is the first to detail the presence of newborn neurons and an immature version of a related cell type, known as astroglia, in patients with epilepsy,"" said Michael Bonaguidi, an assistant professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, gerontology, and biomedical engineering at USC. ""Our findings furnish surprising new insights into how immature astroglia might contribute to epilepsy -- opening an unexplored avenue toward the development of new anti-seizure medications for millions of people.""

First author Aswathy Ammothumkandy, who is a postdoctoral fellow in the Bonaguidi Lab, and her colleagues collaborated with USC neurosurgeons Charles Liu and Jonathan Russin, who often treat patients with seizures that can't be controlled with medication. Drug resistance is particularly common with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, or MTLE, and affects one-third of all patients with this form of the disease. As a result, some patients need to undergo surgery to remove the section of the brain, the hippocampus, that causes their seizures.

""Many patients bravely and generously donate their surgical specimens for research to advance our understanding of epilepsy and to develop new and better therapies,"" said Russin, an assistant professor of neurological surgery, and associate director of the USC Neurorestoration Center. ""These patients know better than anyone the trade-offs involved in the current treatment options, which often either don't provide adequate seizure control, or carry very serious cognitive side effects.""

The surgical specimens afforded a unique opportunity for the researchers to study living brain tissue from patients with epilepsy, and to compare its microscopic anatomy with post-mortem samples from people with no known neurological disease.

In the samples from people both with and without epilepsy, the scientists observed newborn neurons, adding compelling new evidence to the ongoing scientific debate about whether adults retain the ability to generate these cells. In the surgical specimens, the longer the patients had experienced seizures, the scarcer these newborn neurons became. More surprisingly, the surgical specimens contained a persistent population of immature astroglia that were not observed in the disease-free samples.

Because the brain tissue in the surgical specimens was still alive, the scientists could also use it to grow stem cells in the laboratory and test their ability to form newborn neurons and immature astrocytes. In these experiments, a longer disease duration reduced the ability to form newborn neurons and increased the production of immature astroglia, consistent with the team's direct observations of the surgical specimens.

The team also studied electrical activity related to seizures. They found suspicious correlations between where electrical activity was localized within the surgical samples, and the location and behavior of the astroglia.

""Normally, astroglia are considered to be supporting cells, because their job is to create an environment where neurons can thrive,"" said Ammothumkandy. ""But in patients who have lived for many years with epilepsy, it might be immature astroglia that are contributing to both initiating and modulating chronic seizures.""

If this is the case, then immature astroglia could be an effective cell type to target by developing an entirely new class of anti-seizure medications.

""Currently available seizure medications tend to target neurons, so medications that act on immature astroglia could greatly expand the options for our patients,"" said Liu, a professor of neurological surgery, neurology, and biomedical engineering, director of the USC Neurorestoration Center, and director of the USC Epilepsy Care Consortium. ""A new class of drugs could combine with current medical and surgical strategies to control seizures without aggressive surgical removal of parts of the brain that can be critically important for learning, memory and emotional regulation.""

Bonaguidi, Liu and Russin originally kicked off the project with pilot funding from an Eli and Edythe Broad Innovation Award, which supports faculty pursuing research collaborations related to stem cells. The study brought together clinicians, scientists and engineers from across the Keck School of Medicine of USC -- including at the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC, the USC Neurorestoration Center, and the Zilkha Neurogenetic -- the USC Epilepsy Care Consortium, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and the USC Davis School of Gerontology, as well as other universities and medical centers.",0

866,"More Health Systems Join National #MaskUp Campaign Thousands of hospitals send a message to the public: Facemasks can slow the trend

The number of health systems joining the national #MaskUp campaign encouraging Americans to stop the spread of COVID-19 by following safety guidelines continues to grow. A total of 123 health systems with hospitals numbering in the thousands are now united to help keep Americans safe and stem the pandemic.

The public service campaign is critical to the health and well-being of all Americans. It is a plea from healthcare professionals everywhere: wear a mask and follow other precautions to save lives and help get our country back on its feet. This message is critical as we are on the cusp of vaccine distribution that will take place over the next several months.

One of the public service video messages showing healthcare heroes makes the voices of those caring for our patients clear:

“You’ve called us heroes. But heroes don’t deserve this. We’ve fought hard to protect our communities. Month after month. Our shields are worn. Our resolve is being tested.

 Yet we press on. Because we truly want to see this pandemic end. We put our lives on the line daily to keep you safe. So, do something for us. Wear. A. Mask.”

With the holidays upon us, it is crucial that everyone take precautions to slow the surging pandemic, including wearing masks and limiting contact with people who do not live in your home.

As some of the most trusted hospitals in the nation we know that continuing to take precautionary measures is tough. Here’s what we also know: The science has not changed. Masks slow the spread of COVID-19. Diligently washing our hands stops its transmission. And staying 6 feet apart from those we don’t live with makes it harder for the disease to spread too.

The number of positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths is increasing rapidly. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearing 15 million people have tested positive for COVID-19 resulting in deaths approaching the 300,000 mark as of Dec. 7.

If current trends continue, hospital leaders are increasingly concerned healthcare facilities will be overwhelmed as shortages of healthy caregivers make it difficult to handle a rapidly increasing number of patients. Unfortunately, this is already happening in parts of our country.

The CDC points to recent studies that have shown facemasks successfully limit spread of the COVID-19 virus, protecting those who wear them as well as those nearby. In addition to masking, the CDC suggests that everyone minimize the number of non-household contacts, maintain a physical distance of at least six feet, and limit the amount of time around others, especially while indoors and in poorly ventilated areas.

The next several months will be critical. Though there’s been positive news about vaccine development, widespread distribution is months away. Everyone must remain vigilant, take precautions, and follow public health orders. The country has reached a tipping point. The power to do what is right is in the hands of everyone everywhere.

To reach a broader audience, the campaign also includes messages on television, digital platforms, social media, online information, links to vital health resources and more. Regional health systems and hospitals in many communities across the nation are combining resources, demonstrating they are working together to get through this together.

871,"A new study from Tel Aviv University offers a new and unique treatment for AIDS which may be developed into a vaccine or a one time treatment for patients with HIV. The study examined the engineering of type B white blood cells in the patient's body so as to secrete anti-HIV antibodies in response to the virus. The study was led by Dr. Adi Barzel and the PhD student Alessio Nehmad, both from the school of neurobiology, biochemistry and biophysics at the George S. Wise faculty of life sciences and the Dotan Center for Advanced Therapies in collaboration with the Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov). The study was conducted in collaboration with additional researchers from Israel and the US. The study was published in the journal Nature.

Over the last two decades, the lives of many AIDS patients have improved as a result of the administration of treatments that change the disease from lethal to chronic. However, we still have a long way to go before a treatment is found that would provide the patients with a permanent cure. One possible way to do it, with a one time injection, was developed for the first time in Dr. Barzel's laboratory. The technique developed in his lab utilizes type B white blood cells that would be genetically engineered inside the patient's body to secrete neutralizing antibodies against the HIV virus that causes the disease.

B cells are a type of white blood cells responsible for generating antibodies against viruses, bacteria and more. B cells are formed in bone marrow. When they mature, B cells move into the blood and lymphatic system and from there to the different body parts.

Dr Barzel explains: ""until now, only a few scientists, and we among them, had been able to engineer B cells outside of the body, and in this study we were the first to do this in the body and to make these cells generate desired antibodies. The genetic engineering is done with viral carriers derived from viruses that were engineered so as not to cause damage but only to bring the gene coded for the antibody into the B cells in the body. Additionally, in this case we have been able to accurately introduce the antibodies into a desired site in the B cell genome. All model animals who had been administered the treatment responded and had high quantities of the desired antibody in their blood. We produced the antibody from the blood and made sure it was actually effective in neutralizing the HIV virus in the lab dish.""

The genetic editing was done with a CRISPR. This is a technology based on a bacterial immune system against viruses. The bacteria use the CRISPR systems as a sort of molecular ""search engine"" to locate viral sequences and cut them in order to disable them. Two biochemists who had figured out the sophisticated defense mechanism, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, were able to reroute for the cleavage of any DNA of choice. The technology has since been used to either disable unwanted genes or repair and insert desired genes. Doudna and Charpentier earned international recognition when they became chemistry Nobel Prize winners in 2020.

The PhD student Alessio Nehmad elaborates on the use of CRISPR: ""we incorporate the capability of a CRISPR to direct the introduction of genes into desired sites along with the capabilities of viral carriers to bring desired genes to desired cells. Thus, we are able to engineer the B cells inside the patient's body. We use two viral carriers of the AAV family, one carrier codes for the desired antibody and the second carrier codes the CRISPR system. When the CRISPR cuts in the desired site in the genome of the B cells it directs the introduction of the desired gene: the gene coding for the antibody against the HIV virus, which causes AIDS.""

Currently, the researchers explain, there is no genetic treatment for AIDS, so the research opportunities are vast. Dr. Barzel concludes: ""we developed an innovative treatment that may defeat the virus with a onetime injection, with the potential of bringing about tremendous improvement in the patients' condition. When the engineered B cells encounter the virus, the virus stimulates and encourages them to divide, so we are utilizing the very cause of the disease to combat it. Furthermore, if the virus changes, the B cells will also change accordingly in order to combat it, so we have created the first medication ever that can evolve in the body and defeat viruses in the 'arms race'.

Based on this study we can expect that over the coming years we will be able to produce in this way a medication for AIDS, for additional infectious diseases and for certain types of cancer caused by a virus, such as cervical cancer, head and neck cancer and more.""",0

875,"Oct. 12, 2022 – A significant number of people who get COVID-19 continue to have some type of symptoms for months or only feel somewhat better after recovery, according to a new large study published in Nature Communications. Between 6 and18 months after infection, 1 in 20 people hadn’t fully recovered, and 2 in 5 had only improved somewhat. “There are lots of different impacts going beyond health – to quality of life, employment, schooling and the ability to look after yourself,” Jill Pell, PhD, one of the study authors and a professor of public health at the University of Glasgow, told The Washington Post. Pell and colleagues are doing a study of long COVID in Scotland, called the Long-CISS (Covid in Scotland Study). In this analysis, she and colleagues looked at 33,281 people with laboratory-confirmed infections and 62,957 never-infected people who answered questionnaires at 6, 12, and 18 months during the pandemic, as well as hospitalization and death records.

Among 31,486 people with symptomatic infections, 1,856 (or 6%) hadn’t recovered at all in their most recent follow-up survey. Another 13,350 people (or 42%) had only recovered partially. People who hadn’t recovered were more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 and have other mental and physical conditions such as depression and respiratory disease. The risk of long COVID was also higher among women, older adults, and those who live in economically disadvantaged areas. “It has always been the case that those who are sicker are more likely to have long-term sequelae,” David Putrino, PhD, director of rehabilitation innovation for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, told the newspaper. “What is frightening is that the mild cases by far outnumber the severe, so even a small percentage of mild cases going on to develop long-term sequelae is a massive public health concern,” he said. A previous symptomatic infection was also linked to poorer quality of life, trouble with daily activities, and 24 persistent symptoms. Those with symptomatic infections were 3.4 times as likely to have breathlessness, 2.9 times as likely to have confusion or brain fog, 2.5 times as likely to have heart palpitations, and 2 times as likely to have chest pain.",0

884,"Surgical care experts have today unveiled two studies in The Lancet that will help to provide safer surgery for thousands of patients around the world -- particularly in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMIC).

Researchers found that routinely changing gloves and instruments just before closing wounds could significantly reduce Surgical Site Infection (SSI) -- the world's most common post-operative complication. Secondly, they tested a new toolkit that can make hospitals better prepared for pandemics, heatwaves, winter pressures and natural disasters that could reduce cancellations of planned procedures around the world.

Patients in LMICs are disproportionately affected by wound infections, but following a trial of the procedure in Benin, Ghana, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa, researchers found that a routine switch of gloves and instruments during abdominal wound closures could prevent as many as 1 in 8 cases of SSI.

The ChEETAh trial was funded by the UK's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Publishing their findings today in The Lancet, researchers are calling for the practice to be widely implemented -- particularly in LMICs.

Co-author Mr Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham, commented: ""Surgical site infection is the world's most common postoperative complication -- a major burden for both patients and health systems. Our work demonstrates that routine change of gloves and instruments is not only deliverable around the world, but also reduced infections in a range of surgical settings. Taking this simple step could reduce SSIs by 13% -- simply and cost-effectively.""

Patients who develop SSI experience pain, disability, poor healing with risk of wound breakdown, prolonged recovery times and psychological challenges. In health systems where patients have to pay for treatment this can be a disaster and increases the risk of patients being plunged into poverty after their treatment. The simple and low-cost practice of changing your gloves and instruments just before closing the wound is something which can be done by surgeons in any hospital around, meaning a huge potential impact.

Experts from the NIHR Global Research Health Unit on Global Surgery also unveiled their 'Surgical Preparedness Index' (SPI) today in The Lancet -- a key study assessing the extent to which hospitals around the world were able to continue elective surgery during COVID-19.

Researchers identified different features of hospitals that made them more or less 'prepared' for times of increased pressure. They used COVID-19 as an important example, but highlighted that health systems are put under stress for all sorts of reasons each year -- from seasonal pressures to natural disasters, and warfare. A team of clinicians from 32 countries designed the SPI which scores hospitals based on their infrastructure, equipment, staff, and processes used to provide elective surgery. The higher the resulting SPI score, the more prepared a hospital is for disruptions.

After creating the SPI tool, the experts asked 4,714 clinicians in 1,632 hospitals across 119 countries to assess the preparedness of their local surgical department. Overall most hospitals around the world were poorly prepared, and suffered a big drop in the number of procedures they were able to provide during COVID-19. The team found that a 10-point increase in the SPI score corresponded to four more patients that had surgery per 100 patients on the waitlist.

Lead author Mr. James Glasbey, from the University of Birmingham, commented: ""Our new tool will help hospitals internationally improve their preparation for external stresses ranging from pandemics to heatwaves, winter pressures and natural disasters. We believe it help hospitals to get through their waiting lists more quickly, and prevent further delays for patients. The tool can be completed easily by healthcare workers and managers working in any hospital worldwide -- if used regularly, it could protect hospitals and patients against future disruptions.""

Professor Dion Morton, Barling Chair of Surgery at the University of Birmingham and Director of Clinical Research at the Royal College of Surgeons of England commented: ""Although not all postoperative deaths are avoidable, many can be prevented by increasing investment in research, staff training, equipment, and better hospital facilities. We must invest in improving the quality of surgery around the world.""",0
885,"Researchers have created a liquid biopsy test, which uses two circulating proteins, to test for major liver diseases. The test was found to be highly accurate, sensitive, and specific for both NASH and liver fibrosis. For the first time, a non-invasive test will allow for the determination of staging of both diseases without recurring to invasive liver biopsy.

Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) is the most severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is diagnosed in approximately 60% of NAFLD patients. NASH puts people at risk of progressing to advanced liver diseases such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

NAFLD affects approximately 52 million people in Europe and 64 million people in the US, costing $138 billion annually to the European and US healthcare systems combined.

Currently, NASH can only be diagnosed with invasive liver biopsy, which is the standard of diagnosis, but is expensive and has co-morbidities and complications. There are also no reliable blood (i.e. liquid biopsy) tests for the diseases because of low sensitivity and specificity. Current blood tests are also unable to reliably predict NASH and fibrosis staging.

Professor Geltrude Mingrone, from King's College London and Catholic University of Rome, Italy, looked to find a more accurate liquid biopsy test.

The paper, published in leading journal Gut, identified two protein biomarkers, PLIN2 and RAB14, that were used as part of an algorithm to identify people with NASH and/or liver fibrosis. The ability for these proteins to detect NASH was tested in cohorts of people with either biopsy-confirmed NASH or liver fibrosis.

The algorithms, which used A.I., gave impressive results, including a sensitivity of 88-95%, a specificity of 90%-100%, and an overall accuracy of 92-93% for NASH. For fibrosis, they were even better, with a sensitivity of 99%-100%, specificity of 90%-96%, and accuracy of 98%-99%. As well as being much more accurate than all other currently available biomarkers, it is now possible to predict the stages of the diseases without invasive liver biopsy.

Professor Geltrude Mingrone, from King's College London, said: ""This blood test will allow to define the real prevalence of NASH in large and small populations, including children and adolescents, avoiding the need for invasive liver biopsy. Importantly, it will also allow to monitor the efficacy of NASH treatments over time, reducing screen failures and helping generate better drugs.""

These results show that the PLIN2/RAB14-based liquid biopsy can provide rapid and cost-effective testing to combat the growing epidemic of NASH and liver fibrosis. This will be an invaluable tool in diagnosing and monitoring cases of liver diseases, enabling people to receive earlier treatment.

The authors also believe that the testing will allow for the improved capacity for researchers to study NASH and liver fibrosis in the general population, including disease progression, and record the effects of treatment, from lifestyle to surgical and pharmacological interventions.

No NASH drug has been approved by the FDA or EMA due to the lack of an accurate, reliable, and non-invasive test. Between 65-73% of patients that currently enrol in clinical trials for NASH-related therapies are found to be ineligible for the trial due to screen failure. The test -- developed in collaboration with Metadeq Corp. -- is expected to significantly reduce screen failures in clinical trials and improve the chances of new life-saving drugs reaching the market.",0
886,"Why are certain body parts more prone to skin diseases than others?

Two new UC Davis Health studies explored how differences in skin composition may lead to dermatological conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

""Skin does not have a uniform composition throughout the body,"" said Emanual Maverakis, professor of dermatology, molecular medical microbiology at UC Davis and senior author on both studies. ""Different skin characteristics at different body sites may affect the skin's susceptibility to certain diseases.""

Skin diseases affect about 84.5 million Americans. Aging, trauma, and environmental and genetic factors can lead to a wide range of skin conditions.

The skin is the largest organ in the body. It has an average area of about 20 square feet -- that's the size of a 4' by 5' room! Its outermost layer (epidermis) has a lipid matrix composed of free fatty acids, cholesterol and ceramides (a family of waxy lipid molecules).

This layer must meet the environmental challenges specific to each area of the body. For example, the skin of the face needs to be thin and flexible to accommodate facial expressions. The skin covering the heel of the foot has to be thick and rigid to withstand force and protect it from objects we step on.

Skin composition depends on multiple factors, including the structure of the skin barrier, the cell types, and the genes they express.

Until recently, little was known about the cellular and molecular processes behind these differences. In the first study, researchers showed the mechanisms that lead to these structural changes in the skin.

The epidermis has a ""brick and mortar"" structure: molecules like ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids make up the ""mortar,"" and cells called keratinocytes are the ""bricks.""

The researchers used single-cell sequencing to characterize how the keratinocytes differ at different body sites. They also used targeted molecular profiling to characterize the molecules that form the ""mortar"" between the keratinocytes. They then examined how these differences in gene expression matched the compositional differences in the lipid and protein structures across body sites. These experiments explained why the skin looks so different at different body sites.

The compositional differences in the skin's lipids and proteins across different body sites may also explain why different skin diseases are found at different body sites. While characterizing the specific lipid alterations associated with various skin diseases, the researchers discovered that lipids stuck to a piece of tape applied to the skin were sufficient to diagnose a patient with a particular skin disease.

""These discoveries will lead to non-diagnostic tests for common dermatologic disease"" said co-lead author, Project Scientist Alexander Merleev.

""These differences are also relevant to the future design of skin care products,"" said Stephanie Le, dermatology resident and co-lead author of the study. ""They demonstrate how skin care products should be specifically formulated to match the particular body site that they will be applied to.""

In the second study, the research team studied how skin cells interact with the immune system.

Previously, it was known that keratinocytes could secrete substances that both increase and decrease inflammation. Using single-cell sequencing to analyze each keratinocyte individually, the researchers observed that these immune-modulating molecules were expressed in certain layers of the epidermis.

Keratinocytes at the lowest layer of the epidermis secrete immune-attracting and immune anti-inflammatory molecules. This is to attract immune cells to the skin and park them in place to wait patiently to fight off any pathogenic microbe or parasite that might break through the physical barrier of the skin. In contrast, they found that the keratinocytes in the outer layer of the epidermis secrete proinflammatory molecules, in particular IL-36.

IL-36 is a main mediator of a subtype of psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disease. The team found that the amount of IL-36 in the skin was regulated by another molecule called PCSK9 and that individuals with variations in their PCSK9 gene were predisposed to developing psoriasis.

""Our discovery that different layers of the skin secrete different immune mediators is an example of how the skin is highly specialized to interact with the immune system. Some people develop skin diseases, such as psoriasis, when there is an imbalance in the molecules secreted by the different layers of the skin."" said UC Davis research fellow Antonio Ji-Xu, co-lead author of the study.

892,"The Zika virus was present in Haiti several months before the first Zika cases were identified in Brazil, according to new research by infectious-disease specialists at the University of Florida.

This finding confirms that the Zika virus was present in the Americas prior to March 2015, when the virus was first identified in Brazil, and suggests that the spread of Zika virus in the Americas was likely more complicated than early theories presumed.

""We know that the virus was present in Haiti in December of 2014,"" said Dr. Glenn Morris, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of medicine and the director of UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute. ""And, based on molecular studies, it may have been present in Haiti even before that date.""

Although the findings suggest that the Zika virus was circulating in the Americas prior to 2015, what remains unclear is exactly what confluence of factors caused the virus to take off in Brazil.

The findings were published Monday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Researchers hope further inquiry will shed light on the factors that led to the proliferation of Zika virus in Brazil as well as the sharp rise in the number of birth defects in that nation in cases where pregnant women were infected with the then-uncommon flavivirus.

Scientists from UF's environmental and global health department and the Emerging Pathogens Institute isolated the Zika virus from three patients while studying the transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Haiti in 2014. School children exhibiting febrile illness within the Gressier/Leogane region of Haiti were taken to a free outpatient clinic, where blood samples were drawn and screened for dengue, chikungunya and malaria.

Upon isolation, the viruses were first considered ""mystery"" viruses, as PCR-based tests indicated they were neither dengue nor chikungunya viruses, and little attention had been paid to the possibility that Zika virus might be present in the Caribbean. Using a sophisticated RT-PCR based method that potentially amplifies any RNA, the researchers produced PCR amplicons that were subsequently sequenced and identified as Zika virus sequences. The plasma samples that yielded Zika virus were taken three months before March 2015, when Brazilian scientists first confirmed via genetic analysis that Zika virus was present in Brazil and causing a significant disease burden in the South American nation.

The Zika virus was virtually unknown outside of public health circles prior to the 2007 outbreak in the Yap Islands, a small group of islands in Micronesia where an estimated 73 percent of residents 3 years of age and older were infected with the virus. Questions still remain regarding how it came to the Americas.

""The Brazilian and Haitian strains are genetically similar,"" said John Lednicky, Ph.D., an associate professor in the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions' department of environmental and global health and an associate researcher at the Emerging Pathogens Institute.

Lednicky designed the project's virus isolation work and identified and sequenced the Haitian Zika virus isolates. Lednicky said the genetic sequences of the Haitian isolates from 2014 are more similar to those of the French Polynesian strains than to many of the Brazilian Zika virus strains. Lednicky thinks this may be because the Haitian 2014 strain is slightly older than the isolates from Brazil in 2015.

Morris echoed Lednicky's suggestion that Zika virus had been in the Americas for a period of time before it began causing a noticeable level of illness.

""There is a possibility that this virus had been moving around the Caribbean before it hit the right combination of conditions in Brazil and took off,"" Morris said. ""By using the sophisticated culturing and sequencing capabilities that we have here at the Emerging Pathogens Institute, we were able to begin to fill in some of the unknown areas in the history of the Zika virus, leading us toward a better understanding of what caused this outbreak to suddenly occur at the magnitude that it did in Brazil.""",0
893,"Despite concerns that stay-at-home orders and other government efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic would cause lasting harm to people's mental health, research published by the American Psychological Association found that state restrictions in the first six months of the pandemic were not related to worse mental health.

Instead, people with personal exposure to the virus and those who consumed several hours of COVID-19-related media a day were the most likely to experience distress, loneliness and symptoms of traumatic stress.

The findings were published in the journal Health Psychology.

""For the past several decades, our team has been examining the psychological impact of large-scale disasters on the population. In February 2020, we realized that the novel coronavirus, as it was called at the time, was likely to have an effect on the U.S. population in the months to come,"" said senior author Roxane Cohen Silver, PhD, a distinguished professor of psychological science, medicine and public health at the University of California Irvine. ""We were particularly interested in the potential negative mental health effects of the associated restrictions placed on individuals throughout the pandemic, despite their potential for minimizing the spread of illness.""

The researchers surveyed a nationally representative sample of more than 6,500 participants at the start of the pandemic from March 18 to April 18, 2020, then surveyed almost 5,600 of the same participants approximately six months later from Sept. 26 to Oct. 16 to measure how their mental health and exposure to the virus changed over the course of the pandemic.

Respondents answered questions about symptoms of distress, loneliness and traumatic stress (acute and post-traumatic stress) they experienced in the prior week; whether they had contracted COVID-19; how many people they knew who had contacted the virus or died because of COVID-19; and how many hours on average they spent daily over the past week consuming pandemic-related news on traditional media, online news sources and social media platforms. The researchers then compared their responses with data about the spread of COVID-19 and government mitigation efforts, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders in each respondent's state.

Researchers found that, overall, participants experienced more loneliness and symptoms of global distress, such as depression and anxiety, over the course of the six months, but their distress was not significantly related to state-level restrictions. Instead, personal experiences with COVID (degree of illness, losses), along with the amount of media about the pandemic to which individuals were exposed, were stronger predictors of psychological symptoms than state-level restrictions (mask mandates, closures, etc.) or case rates or death rates.

Participants who responded that they had contracted COVID-19 in the first six months of the pandemic were the most likely to report poor mental health. Knowing someone who died because of COVID-19 or someone who had contracted COVID-19 were also significantly related to distress, loneliness, and symptoms of traumatic stress, according to Rebecca Thompson, PhD, the report's first author and postdoctoral scholar at UC Irvine.

""Because a strong predictor of distress in our study was personal bereavement -- knowing someone who had been very sick or died was far more stressful than the presence of state-level restrictions -- future waves of COVID-19 and other potential pandemics should be met by targeted interventions to prevent loss of life,"" Thompson said. ""Given this work, we would likely expect similar distress responses in future pandemics, highlighting the importance of public health initiatives to curb the spread of illness in our communities.""

Greater hours of exposure to pandemic-related media coverage was also significantly related to increased symptoms of distress over time.

""For the first year of the pandemic, it was all bad news all the time,"" Silver said. ""Repeated exposure to that content was unlikely to have psychological benefits.""

In the case of future disasters or traumatic events, Silver recommends that individuals monitor the degree to which they immerse themselves in bad news (e.g., avoid ""doomscrolling"") and consider specific times to check the news throughout the day.

""One can stay informed without becoming overwhelmed with a constant onslaught of bad news,"" said Silver.",0

901,"ARFID is strongly influenced by genetic factors, according to a twin study examining this relatively new type of eating disorder. The study has been published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry by researchers at Karolinska Institutet.

ARFID is a serious eating disorder that leads to malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies. Researchers estimate that between one to five percent of the population is affected by the eating disorder.

Unlike anorexia nervosa, ARFID is not about the patient's experience of their own body and fear of gaining weight. Instead, the disease is characterised by the avoidance of certain types of food due to a sensory discomfort because of the characteristics or appearance of food, or for example, the fear of choking, a food poisoning phobia, or lack of appetite.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now investigated the importance of genetic factors for developing ARFID. A cohort of almost 17,000 pairs of twins in Sweden born between 1992 and 2010 participated in the study. A total of 682 children with ARFID between the ages of six and twelve years could be identified.

The researchers used the twin method to determine the influence of genes and the environment on the onset of the disease.

""We know that identical twins share all genes and that fraternal twins share about half of the genes that make people different. When we then see that a certain trait is more common in both members of identical twin pairs than in fraternal twin pairs, it is an indication that there is a genetic influence. We can then estimate the degree to which a trait is influenced by genetic factors,"" says Lisa Dinkler.

The researchers discovered that the genetic component for developing ARFID was high, 79 per cent. This means that 79 per cent of the risk of developing ARFID can be explained by genetic factors.

""This study suggests that ARFID is highly heritable. The genetic component is higher than that of other eating disorders and on par with that of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and ADHD,"" says Lisa Dinkler, a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Karolinska Institutet

ARFID is a relatively new diagnosis. In 2013, the disorder was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5, and this year it was included in the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual ICD. The latest edition, ICD-11, will be introduced to the Swedish healthcare system in a couple of years, consequently, the diagnosis is not an official part of Swedish health and medical care yet.

The next step in Dr. Dinkler's research is to study the extent to which ARFID is associated with other psychiatric diagnoses, such as anxiety and depression, neurodevelopmental disorders, and gastrointestinal problems.

""We will use twin studies to test the extent to which ARFID shares underlying genetic and environmental factors with these conditions,"" says Dr. Dinkler.

The study was mainly funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Mental Health Fund, Fredrik and Ingrid Thuring Foundation, Lundbeckfonden, NIMH and Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Many of the researchers have received fees from private companies for work done outside this study, see the scientific article for more information.",0

904,"​Study aims to determine safety and efficacy of experimental monoclonal antibodies.

Patients admitted with COVID-19 at select hospitals may now volunteer to enroll in a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of a potential new treatment for the disease. The Phase 3 randomized, controlled trial is known as ACTIV-3, and as a “master protocol,” it is designed to expand to test multiple different kinds of monoclonal antibody treatments. It also can enroll additional volunteers in the middle of the trial, if a specific investigational treatment shows promise.

The new study is one of four ongoing or planned trials in the National Institutes of Health’s. Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) program, a public-private partnership to speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccine candidates. It also is receiving support through Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s multi-agency effort to develop, manufacture and distribute medical countermeasures to fight COVID-19.

The trial will take place at select hospitals around the world that are part of existing clinical trial networks. They include the lead network, the International Network of Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT), operated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health. Collaborating clinical trial networks include the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury network (PETAL) and Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN), supported by the NIH’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute through the Collaborating Network of Networks for Evaluating COVID-19 and Therapeutic Strategies (CONNECTS) program, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.

“Under Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. Government has brought together multiple agencies to accelerate the development, manufacture and distribution of medical countermeasures for COVID-19,” said NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “The ACTIV studies are just a few examples of this critical activity, which emphasizes flexibility and minimizes delays to generate scientifically sound results.”

ACTIV-3 uses an adaptive two-stage Phase 3 protocol design. The ACTIV-3 trial can be modified to test additional experimental therapeutics and flexibly allow novel therapeutics to enter at either stage 1 or stage 2. In addition, if a treatment appears to be safe and effective in the initial stage after review by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB), the investigational therapeutic proceeds to stage 2 testing, where more volunteers are enrolled. If an investigational therapeutic is unsafe or not likely to be effective, it will be dropped.

The ACTIV-3 study will begin by studying the investigational monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555, which was identified in a blood sample from a recovered COVID-19 patient. Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins made by the immune system that can bind to the surface of viruses and prevent them from infecting cells. Synthetic versions of antibodies can be reproduced in a laboratory. These manufactured antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies. The LY-CoV555 antibody was discovered by Abcellera Biologics (Vancouver, British Columbia) in collaboration with NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center. Subsequently, it was developed and manufactured by Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Indiana), in partnership with AbCellera. The investigational product also is being tested in another ongoing NIAID study, ACTIV-2, which is studying its safety and efficacy in people with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 who have not been hospitalized. Safety data and other findings will be shared across the ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3 studies through the DSMB.

“Studying the impact of this investigational therapeutic on multiple patient populations at the same time is critical to determining whether it can help COVID-19 patients with differing levels of disease severity,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “These concurrent trials have the potential to yield significant and comprehensive clinical data.”

The initial stage of the ACTIV-3 clinical trial aims to enroll approximately 300 volunteers who have been hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 with fewer than 13 days of symptoms. Once their COVID-19 infections have been confirmed and they have consented to take part in the study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an intravenous (IV) infusion of LY-CoV555 or a saline placebo infusion. Participants also will receive standard care for COVID-19, including the antiviral remdesivir. After five days, participants’ symptoms will be assessed, as will their need for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or other supportive care. Volunteers will be followed for 90 days after enrollment and will receive regular examinations and have blood samples taken periodically during this time to analyze their response to the investivational therapeutic.

Data collected on the fifth day of the volunteers’ participation will determine whether the investigational therapeutic will be administered to a larger group of volunteers. If LY-CoV555 appears to be safe and appears to be effective, the trial will enroll an additional 700 participants. It also will begin enrolling more severely ill participants, such as those with organ failure requiring mechanical support, or COVID-19-associated dysfunction of organs other than the lungs. The primary endpoint of the trial is the participants’ sustained recovery for 14 days after release from the hospital.

The principal investigator of ACTIV-3 is Jens Lundgren, M.D., of the University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet. Leads of the participating networks include James Neaton, Ph.D., of the INSIGHT network, Taylor Thompson, M.D., of the PETAL network, Annetine Gelijns, Ph.D., and Alan Moskowitz, M.D., of the CTSN, and Rachel Ramoni, D.M.D., Sc.D., of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. To ensure that the trial is being conducted in a safe and effective manner, an independent DSMB will oversee the trial and conduct periodic reviews of the accumulating data.

907,"Results from a large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Liberia show that two candidate Ebola vaccines pose no major safety concerns and can elicit immune responses by one month after initial vaccination that last for at least one year. The findings, published in the October 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, are based on a study of 1,500 adults that began during the West Africa Ebola outbreak. The trial is being conducted by a U.S.-Liberia clinical research collaboration known as the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL), established in 2014 in response to the request from the Liberian Minister of Health to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and involves scientists and clinicians from Liberia and the United States.

“This clinical trial has yielded valuable information that is essential for the continued development of these two Ebola vaccine candidates and also demonstrates that well-designed, ethically sound clinical research can be conducted during an epidemic,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “A safe and effective vaccine would be a critically important addition to classical public health measures in controlling inevitable future Ebola outbreaks.”

PREVAIL conducts collaborative biomedical research in accordance with best practices, to advance science, strengthen health policy and practice, and improve the health of people in Liberia and around the world. The partnership launched this first study, PREVAIL 1, in February 2015. Originally designed to enroll 28,000 volunteers, the trial was scaled back to a Phase 2 study when the decline in new Ebola cases made it impossible to conduct a large efficacy study.

""In Liberia, we have demonstrated to the global community that rigorous scientific research can take place in a developing sub-Saharan African country when a mutually beneficial partnership is developed,” noted Dr. Bernice T. Dahn, Liberia’s Minister of Health. “The work of PREVAIL, ranging from the Ebola vaccine to the Ebola survivor studies, clearly manifest the prospects of such a sustainable partnership and clinical research platform.”

The co-leaders of the trial are Stephen B. Kennedy, M.D., M.P.H., senior research scientist at the University of Liberia-Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (UL-PIRE) Africa Center, an infectious disease research center; Fatorma Bolay, Ph.D., director, Public Health and Medical Research at the National Public Health Institute of Liberia; and H. Clifford Lane, M.D., NIAID's clinical director.

The vaccine candidates included cAd3-EBOZ, co-developed by NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK); and rVSV-ZEBOV, which was initially engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada and is now licensed to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., (Merck). GSK and Merck provided the test vaccines for the study.

From Feb. 2, 2015, through April 30, 2015, the trial rapidly enrolled men and women ages 18 and older with no reported history of Ebola virus disease at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia. Three groups of 500 volunteers received one of the vaccine candidates or a placebo (saline injection). Participants provided blood samples before vaccination and again at one week, one month, six months and one year post-vaccination. Investigators then tested each of these samples for antibodies to the Ebola virus. Responses at one week were modest with both vaccines. However, by one month, 71 percent of cAd3-EBOZ recipients and 84 percent of rVSV-ZEBOV recipients developed an antibody response compared to 3 percent of placebo recipients. At one year, antibody responses were largely maintained in both groups: 64 percent of cAd3-EBOZ recipients and 80 percent of rVSV-ZEBOV recipients had an antibody response compared with seven percent of placebo recipients.

Some participants who received the investigational vaccines experienced mild to moderate side effects that resolved, such as headache, muscle pain, feverishness and fatigue. Overall, investigators did not identify any major safety concerns related to the vaccines. Most of the serious medical issues reported during the trial were due to malaria.

Interestingly, at the beginning of the trial investigators found that 4 percent of participants already had a certain threshold of Ebola antibodies — indicative of past Ebola infection — but no known history of Ebola virus disease. Investigators also found unexpectedly that the proportion of participants developing malaria by one year was lower for participants who received the investigational vaccines as compared with those receiving placebo, particularly among the rVSV-ZEBOV recipients. Future studies are needed to determine if this is a chance finding or if it has some significance related to cross-reactive immunity.

The reported findings expand on initial data that were presented in February 2016 at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston. For more information about the trial, search ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT02344407.

908,"According to a recent analysis of data from two major eye disease studies, adherence to the Mediterranean diet – high in vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil – correlates with higher cognitive function. Dietary factors also seem to play a role in slowing cognitive decline. Researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health, led the analysis of data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2. They published their results today in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: the Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.

“We do not always pay attention to our diets. We need to explore how nutrition affects the brain and the eye” said Emily Chew, M.D., director of the NEI Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications and lead author of the studies.

The researchers examined the effects of nine components of the Mediterranean diet on cognition. The diet emphasizes consumption of whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, and olive oil, as well as reduced consumption of red meat and alcohol.

AREDS and AREDS2 assessed over years the effect of vitamins on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which damages the light-sensitive retina. AREDS included about 4,000 participants with and without AMD, and AREDS2 included about 4,000 participants with AMD. The researchers assessed AREDS and AREDS2 participants for diet at the start of the studies. The AREDS study tested participants’ cognitive function at five years, while AREDS2 tested cognitive function in participants at baseline and again two, four, and 10 years later. The researchers used standardized tests based on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination to evaluate cognitive function as well as other tests. They assessed diet with a questionnaire that asked participants their average consumption of each Mediterranean diet component over the previous year.

Participants with the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet had the lowest risk of cognitive impairment. High fish and vegetable consumption appeared to have the greatest protective effect. At 10 years, AREDS2 participants with the highest fish consumption had the slowest rate of cognitive decline.

The numerical differences in cognitive function scores between participants with the highest versus lowest adherence to a Mediterranean diet were relatively small, meaning that individuals likely won’t see a difference in daily function. But at a population level, the effects clearly show that cognition and neural health depend on diet.

The researchers also found that participants with the ApoE gene, which puts them at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease, on average had lower cognitive function scores and greater decline than those without the gene. The benefits of close adherence to a Mediterranean diet were similar for people with and without the ApoE gene, meaning that the effects of diet on cognition are independent of genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

The AREDS and AREDS2 studies were supported by the NEI Intramural Research Program and contracts NOI-EY-0-2127 (AREDS), HHS-N-260-2005-00007-C (AREDS2), and N01-EY-5-0007 (AREDS2). Additional research funds were provided by the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the National Institute on Aging, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The AREDS trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00594672. AREDS2 is registered as NCT00345176. The studies took place at the NIH Clinical Center.

922,"PHOENIX – Mayo Clinic researchers have found that azathioprine, a drug commonly used to treat autoimmune disease, may increase the risk of myeloid neoplasms. Myeloid neoplasms include a spectrum of potentially life-threatening bone marrow disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. The results are published in JAMA Oncology.

Researchers analyzed more than 40,000 patient cases with 27 common autoimmune diseases, such as Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, among others, that were seen over a decade at Mayo Clinic. They identified 86 patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. Detailed data on each patient’s drug exposures, duration and disease characteristics were collected and compared to autoimmune patients without bone marrow disorders of myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia. The results concluded that only azathioprine was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. However, other agents used showed a similar trend that was not statistically significant.

“Similar associations were already documented in case reports and case series, but have never been evaluated in a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases in that many patients and in context of individual medications,” says Raoul Tibes, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study and former director of the Acute and Chronic Leukemia Program at Mayo Clinic’s Arizona campus. “Interestingly, there was no association with length of time on therapy and resulting myeloid neoplasm.”

“This study, along with our current knowledge of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, suggests that individualized drug selection and monitoring during treatment could be possible,” says Natalie Ertz-Archambault, M.D., co-author of the study. “Future genomic profiling studies may help to identify patients at risk for myeloid neoplasms when exposed to azathioprine or other drugs,” adds Dr. Tibes.

The researchers emphasize that, while the results of the study are intriguing, they should not change or replace the clinical judgments, monitoring and current standard treatments at this stage for patients with an autoimmune disease.

Despite its large size, the researchers note this study’s limitations. It was a retrospective study. Many different autoimmune diseases were analyzed, which can each affect the results. Only myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia were assessed. And no definitive causal association was made between taking a particular drug and myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia. Further, the number of patients with autoimmune disease developing myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia is still low overall, and no prediction for individual patients can be concluded from the study.

• More people are taking melatonin supplements to help with sleep, according to new research.
• Melatonin is a hormone that is naturally produced in the body, but it can also be consumed in supplement form.
• Past studies have found that labels on melatonin supplements were inaccurate. More people are taking supplemental melatonin, and at increasingly high doses, according to a recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Researchers point out these findings raise safety concerns since the actual dose of melatonin supplements could be nearly 500 percent higher than the label indicates.

Researchers looked at nearly 20 years of data For this study, researchers analyzed roughly 20 years of data from the to examine reported prevalence and trends in use of supplemental melatonin among over 55,000 U.S. adults. They also wanted to determine the prevalence of people using more than 5 milligrams (mg) of the sleep aid per day. The findings show that by 2018, people were taking over twice the amount of melatonin than they did 10 years before. “Given the increasing popularity in use of exogenous melatonin, our observations support the need for better awareness of safety and effects of melatonin supplements in the public as well as among medical professionals,” said Naima Covassin, PhD, a senior research fellow in the department of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and one of the study authors. She added that little is known about how melatonin interacts with other drugs and whether chronic use is safe. “While melatonin supplements are generally considered safe and well tolerated, side effects have been reported, especially at high doses and in patients with preexisting health risk factors,” said Covassin. She emphasized that the increasing popularity of supplemental melatonin supports the need for better awareness of the safety and effects of melatonin supplements among the public and medical professionals. “The results of increased melatonin consumption from 1999 to 2000 through 2017 to 2018 were not surprising,” Covassin said. “However, we were surprised by finding an increase in use of high dose melatonin (over 5 mg per day), which has become apparent over recent years.”

“Your body naturally produces melatonin in your pineal gland, and it is an essential hormone for helping to regulate your ,” Dr. Stacie J. Stephenson, also known as the “VibrantDoc,” a recognized leader in functional medicine and author of the self-care book “Vibrant: A Groundbreaking Program to Get Energized, Reverse Aging, and Glow,” told Healthline. She explained that the pineal gland takes its cues from light, and it can get “confused” with light exposure at night or darkness during the day. “You may consequently have trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep,” said Stephenson. “The occasional use of supplemental melatonin can help to regulate circadian rhythm by giving your body what your pineal gland may not be producing sufficiently.”

While melatonin supplements can help people get a good night’s sleep, past research finds that supplement labels may be inaccurate. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements like it does for drugs. Stephenson said a 2017 study evaluating melatonin content in dietary supplements showed over 70 percent of melatonin supplements didn’t contain the dose stated on the label. “[The] actual content was up to 83 percent less than stated or up to 478 percent more than stated,” she said. According to Stephenson, the study also found that even within different bottles of the same supplement line, there was as much as 465 percent variability of ingredients. “Furthermore, the study showed that some brands also included significant amounts of serotonin (a neurotransmitter), which was not claimed on the label — and that could be hazardous,” she said. “Adulterated supplements are actually quite common. I would certainly be cautious and look for quality control data on any supplement you choose,” Stephenson added.

Not FDA approved for safety or effectiveness “Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement and is not FDA approved for safety or effectiveness,” confirmed Sarah Gallucci, DO, an assistant professor of medicine in the department of sleep medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. She added that there is an organization that confirms the claimed dosage and purity of some brands. “Supplements that are verified by the United States Pharmacopeial convention are the most reliable,” said Gallucci. “USP verified supplements are tested to ensure that the potency and amounts match the label and that the product does not contain harmful levels of specified contaminants.” Gallucci added that melatonin is considered “generally safe,” with few serious adverse effects. “The most common side effects are headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue,” she said. Gallucci cautioned that taking too much melatonin could disrupt our sleep-wake cycle, making it more difficult to fall asleep. “Safe starting doses range from 2 to 5 mg,” she advised. “Melatonin does not have any addictive potential, which can be seen with some prescription sleep medications.”",0
925,"New Breast Cancer Study Finds Survival Increases When Time Between Diagnosis and Treatment Conclusion is Limited Research by surgical oncologists at Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi notes the benefit of completing surgery, chemotherapy and radiation within 38 weeks of diagnosis

Research from Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has found an increase in patient survival rates when treatment options – surgery, chemotherapy and radiation – are completed within 38 weeks from the time of diagnosis.

The observational study, which included more than 28,000 breast cancer patients registered in the American National Cancer Database, is the largest of its kind to evaluate breast cancer survival and time to completion for all therapies. It found the treatment duration of less than 38 weeks was associated with a higher five-year survival – 89.9 percent compared to the 83.3 percent in the greater than 38 weeks treatment duration. This builds on previous research that noted poorer outcomes when there was a delay in time to treatment initiation, although time to treatment completion was not assessed in these studies.

The study’s authors point out it is important to identify the reasons for delays in treatment and where in the process they occur, and to design programs to measure and pursue optimization of time to treatment to decrease anxiety for patients and improve their chances of survival.

“The biggest difference in our study from others that have looked at time to treat was that we looked at the time from diagnosis to the completion of the multimodality treatment, not only at one individual part, to identify the 38-week window to improve survival rate for patients with breast cancer,” said Debra Pratt M.D., director of the Breast Center at Cleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital, and the lead author of the study.

“In breast and other cancers, patients don’t only get surgery, but may also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy,” Dr. Pratt said. “This becomes a complicated system to navigate and there are multiple reasons why delays arise in treatment being completed. This analysis helps us identify opportunities for improving care within the delivery systems.”

Other studies evaluating the time to treatment for breast cancer by individual treatment modality have concluded that the optimal time from diagnosis to first surgical treatment was less than 90 days from diagnosis; less than 120 days from diagnosis to adjuvant chemotherapy; and when chemo is administered, the radiation should start less than 365 days from date of diagnosis. The last two are consistent with Commission on Cancer’s Cancer Central Clinical Participant Registry (C3PR) quality indicators, which uses registry data to measure quality of cancer care.

“What we found is that the optimal time for treatment completion is 99 days shorter than C3PR quality indicators,” Dr. Pratt said. “We have so much more data now to reassess these quality indicators and determine what those metrics should be.”

The study did not allow researchers to gauge the causes for delays beyond 38 weeks, but Dr. Pratt said from experience, she can divide them into medical, personal and systemic factors.

“If patients have medical issues, they may have to go through other assessments, such as cardiac clearance, which are done as a precaution,” she explained. “These are the hardest to control. Other delays are personal, for example, where the patient does not want to be seen at the first appointment available because of financial reasons or chooses to prioritize a family event over surgery.”

She says medical facilities can, however, control some of the systemic factors to speed up the process. These include adequate staffing and improved systems to increase ease of access, such as making special reservations to schedule urgent assessments like metastatic surveys and breast MRI, as well as a reduction in insurance delays in approving tests required to complete pre-treatment assessments.

Stephen Grobmyer, M.D., chair of the Oncology Institute at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, an integral part of Mubadala Health, and a co-author on the study, says that care must be consolidated to help patients receive treatment on time.

“What we see happen traditionally in the U.S. and even in the U.A.E. is that the patient has to visit multiple specialists – first a surgeon, then a medical oncologist for chemotherapy followed by a radiation oncologist – all of which are scheduled weeks apart and in different places,” he said. “There is this phenomenon of ‘serial care,’ rather than coordinated and planned care.”

Dr. Grobmyer adds that Cleveland Clinic has tried to avoid this issue with its coordinated multidisciplinary cancer programing. For example, in preparation of the opening of its cancer tower, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi opened its dedicated Breast Health Clinic last year. The facility offers targeted diagnostic testing, genetic counseling, innovative therapies and treatments, as well as reconstruction specialists and disease-specific experts to address all breast health issues, in one location and in the shortest time possible.

“We are trying to anticipate the needs of the patients and plan for all their treatment from the beginning so that it is seamless, efficient and reduces their anxiety,” he said. “We have also started measuring time to treatment as a quality measure.”

Dr. Pratt said further studies to determine which type of treatment has the most delays will aid their efforts in optimizing care.

“One of the data points missing in our study was the last day of chemotherapy for these patients, so we could not determine where the majority of delays occurred,” she said. “One of my hopes is to look at our patients’ data to know where the challenges lie and how we can fix them.”",0
926,"Medical abortions are an FDA-approved, safe method to terminate a pregnancy. Sean Locke / Stocksy
• The heartbeat abortion ban in Texas has made it difficult for pregnant people to obtain needed abortion services.
• In addition, a leaked memo suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court may be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaving it up to states to decide the fate of abortion.
• One way people are getting around the ban is by obtaining abortion drugs online.
• Experts say medical abortions are an FDA-approved, safe method to terminate a pregnancy.
• Organizations such as Plan C and Aid Access might be able to help people obtain safe, inexpensive abortion services even when restrictive laws exist. Abortion has long been a contentious issue in America. Since the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion groups have fought hard to see the verdict overturned, while pro-choice advocates have fought just as hard to protect it. In the past year, several states have seemed to be making headway in the battle against abortion rights, in particular the state of Texas, which passed a so-called “heartbeat” abortion ban, which prohibits abortion once cardiac activity has been detected, usually around 6 weeks into the pregnancy. The ban is controversial because people often do not even know they are pregnant until well after 6 weeks into their pregnancy. Most recently, a leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion has sparked concern that it might be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade, a move which would leave individual states responsible for deciding whether abortion would be allowed within their borders. Explaining what this might mean for Americans, Neesha Davé, deputy director of the Lilith Fund, an organization which provides financial assistance and emotional support for Texans needing abortions, told the Texas Tribune, “We have been living the last eight months in a post-Roe Texas. It has been absolutely devastating for people seeking abortion care…” The Texas Tribune reports that since the law went into effect, there has been a flood of people visiting neighboring states to obtain abortions as well as people carrying unwanted pregnancies to term. In addition, many Texans seeking to terminate their pregnancies have opted for medical abortion via telemedicine.

Medical abortion is done using two drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. According to Dr. Emily Godfrey, MPH, an associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Family Planning at the University of Washington, says mifepristone works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which keeps an early pregnancy from progressing. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin medication that induces uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. This medication regimen has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2000. Godfrey said the procedure is generally considered to be safe, with less than 1 percent of people who use it having significant complications. These types of abortions have been on the rise in recent years, and many people going to clinics for an abortion would be able to choose this type of abortion versus a more invasive procedure. With the Texas law in place, people who wish to end their pregnancy may turn to telemedicine options to obtain a medical abortion. Plan C is an advocacy organization that provides people with information on how to obtain abortion pills. Godfrey said a medical abortion is appropriate for almost everyone still in their first trimester of pregnancy who does not have contraindications to either of the medications, such as an allergy. It is FDA-approved for use in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Anyone who is taking blood thinners or having symptoms of a potential ectopic pregnancy should not use them, however. People taking steroid medications regularly or who have severe anemia should consult a physician before undergoing a medical abortion. Anyone who has an IUD should have it removed before taking the pills.

How can people in restrictive states access a medical abortion? The Plan C website offers several creative suggestions for obtaining a medical abortion. However, the simplest and least expensive method appears to be going through an organization called Aid Access. Aid Access is an online telemedicine service for people who want to do a self-managed medical abortion. For a , a licensed doctor in Amsterdam will write the prescriptions for the medications, and they are shipped from a reputable pharmacy in India. The website provides a helpdesk and doctor to answer any questions during any stage of the process.

What if you have complications? Godfrey noted that a small number of people might have complications during a medical abortion, such as prolonged bleeding or cramping or a failed abortion. If they have heavy bleeding (soaking two pads an hour for more than 2 hours in a row), she said they should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. They should also see a healthcare professional if they feel ill, have abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C) for more than 24 hours after using misoprostol. If a person has continued bleeding for more than 4 weeks after their abortion, they should visit a healthcare professional. If the person does not have any bleeding after 24 hours of taking the misoprostol pills, they might also consider reaching out to their physician, she said. She did note, however, that statistically, medical abortion pills are about 30 times safer than carrying a pregnancy to childbirth.",0

Districts with mostly poor students were impacted even more severely, according to the recently released Education Recovery Scorecard.

“When you have a massive crisis, the worst effects end up being felt by the people with the least resources,” Stanford University researcher Sean Reardon, EdD, told The Associated Press.

Reardon, an education professor, did the analysis with Harvard economist Thomas Kane, PhD, by comparing standardized test data known as the “nation’s report card” with state-level test results from 29 states and Washington, DC.

An interesting finding was that school closure – a politically charged topic – was not linked to greater learning losses.

“Achievement losses varied widely among districts that spent the same share of 2020-21 in remote learning,” the study authors explained. “Just as California, a state with long school closures, had losses smaller than Maine (a state with low rates of school closures), many districts which spent much of the year in remote learning had smaller losses than districts which were in person. Moreover, even in districts which were not remote for any of the year, scores in math and reading declined substantially (by one-third and one-fifth of a grade level, on average).”",0
936,"People who reported getting regular, uninterrupted sleep did a better job sticking to their exercise and diet plans while trying to lose weight, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology, Prevention, Lifestyle & Cardiometabolic Health Scientific Sessions 2023. The meeting will be held in Boston, February 28-March 3, 2023, and offers the latest science on population-based health and wellness and implications for lifestyle and cardiometabolic health.

""Focusing on obtaining good sleep -- seven to nine hours at night with a regular wake time along with waking refreshed and being alert throughout the day -- may be an important behavior that helps people stick with their physical activity and dietary modification goals,"" said Christopher E. Kline, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of health and human development at the University of Pittsburgh. ""A previous study of ours reported that better sleep health was associated with a significantly greater loss of body weight and fat among participants in a year-long, behavioral weight loss program.""

The researchers examined whether good sleep health was related to how well people adhered to the various lifestyle modifications prescribed in a 12-month weight loss program. The weight-loss program included 125 adults (average age of 50 years, 91% female, 81% white) who met criteria for overweight or obesity (body mass index of 27-44) without any medical conditions requiring medical supervision of their diet or physical activity.

Sleep habits were measured at the beginning of the program, at 6 months and at 12 months, through patient questionnaires, a sleep diary and 7-day readings from a wrist-worn device that recorded sleep, waking activity and rest. These measures were used to score each participant as ""good"" or ""poor"" on six measures of sleep: regularity; satisfaction; alertness; timing; efficiency (the percentage of time spent in bed when actually asleep); and duration. A composite sleep health score of 0-6 was calculated for each participant, with one point for each ""good"" measure of sleep health, with higher scores indicating better levels of sleep health.

Adherence to the weight loss program was measured by percentage of group intervention sessions attended; percentage of days in which each participant ate between 85-115% of their recommended daily calories; and change in daily duration of moderate or vigorous physical activity. Participants had an average sleep health score of 4.5 out of 6 at the start of the study, at 6 months and at 12 months. Participants self-reported their caloric intake each day using a phone app and researchers measured participants' physical activity with an accelerometer worn at the waist for one week at a time at the start of the study, at 6 months and at 12 months.

After adjusting the sleep health scores for age, gender, race and whether or not there was a partner sharing the bed, the researchers found that better sleep health was associated with higher rates of attendance at group interval sessions, adherence to caloric intake goals and improvement in time spent performing moderate-vigorous physical activity. They found:
• Participants attended 79% of group sessions in the first six months and 62% of group sessions in the second six months.
• Participants met their daily caloric intake goals on 36% of days in the first six months and 21% in the second six months.
• Participants increased their total daily time spent in moderate-vigorous activity by 8.7 minutes in the first six months, however, their total time spent decreased by 3.7 minutes in the second six months.

The decrease in group session attendance, caloric intake and in time spent in moderate-vigorous activity in the second six months was expected, Kline said. ""As one continues in a long-term behavioral weight loss intervention, it's normal for the adherence to weight loss behaviors to decrease,"" he said.

Additionally, while there was an association between better sleep health scores and an increase in physical activity, it was not strong enough to be statistically significant, meaning that researchers cannot rule out that the results were due to chance.

""We had hypothesized that sleep would be associated with lifestyle modification; however, we didn't expect to see an association between sleep health and all three of our measures of lifestyle modification,"" he said. ""Although we did not intervene on sleep health in this study, these results suggest that optimizing sleep may lead to better lifestyle modification adherence. ""

The study's limitations include that it did not incorporate any intervention to help participants improve their sleep, that the study sample was not recruited based upon participants' sleep health characteristics, and that the overall sample population had relatively good sleep health at baseline. The sample was also primarily white and female, so it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to more diverse populations.

""One question of interest for future research is whether we can increase adherence to lifestyle modifications -- and, ultimately, increase weight loss -- if we improve a person's sleep health,"" Kline said.

A second question for the researchers is how such an intervention would be timed to improve sleep.

""It remains unclear whether it would be best to optimize sleep prior to rather than during attempted weight loss. In other words, should clinicians tell their patients to focus on getting better and more regular sleep before they begin to attempt weight loss, or should they try to improve their sleep while at the same time modifying their diet and activity levels?"" Kline said.

Improving one's sleep health is something everyone can do to improve their cardiovascular health and is a key component of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8. Sleep was added in 2022 as the eighth component of optimal cardiovascular health, which includes eating healthy food, being physically active, not smoking, getting enough sleep, maintaining a healthy weight and controlling cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Cardiovascular disease claims more lives each year in the U.S. than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined, according to the 2023 Statistical Update from the American Heart Association.

""There are over 100 studies linking sleep to weight gain and obesity, but this was a great example showing how sleep isn't just tied to weight itself, it's tied to the things we're doing to help manage our own weight. This could be because sleep impacts the things that drive hunger and cravings, your metabolism and your ability to regulate metabolism and the ability to make healthy choices in general,"" said Michael A. Grandner, Ph.D., MTR. Grandner is director of the Sleep and Heath Research Program at the University of Arizona, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic at the Banner-University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona, and was a co-author of the Association's Life's Essential 8 cardiovascular health score. ""Studies like this really go to show that all of these things are connected, and sometimes sleep is the thing that we can start taking control over that can help open doors to other avenues of health.""",0

938,"Study finds elevated risk of certain rare blood cancers after chemotherapy for most solid tumors

Findings from a new study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) show that patients treated with chemotherapy for most solid tumors during 2000–2014 experienced an increased risk of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (tMDS/AML). The study, which used U.S. population-based cancer registry data from NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and treatment information from the SEER–Medicare database, was published December 20, 2018, in JAMA Oncology. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.

Advances in treatment over the last several decades have resulted in improved survival for patients with many types of cancer. However, survivors may be at increased risk of developing a subsequent treatment-related cancer. In this study, researchers aimed to quantify the risk of developing tMDS/AML, a rare but often fatal blood cancer, in patients treated with chemotherapy.

“We’ve known for a long time that the development of myeloid leukemia is a very rare adverse effect of some types of cancer treatments that damage cells,” said Lindsay Morton, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a senior investigator in NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. “There have been many changes in cancer treatment over time, including the introduction of new chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations, but we didn’t know what the risk of therapy-related leukemia looked like for patients since these changes were made.”

Because tMDS/AML is rare, most data on the disease have come from case series, case–control studies, and clinical trials, which often include a relatively small number of tMDS/AML cases. In this study, investigators brought a population-based data approach to the research, with a much larger sample size and prospective data from long-term patient follow-up.

To this end, they analyzed SEER registry data on more than 700,000 patients age 20–84 in the United States with solid tumors who were diagnosed and treated with initial chemotherapy during 2000–2013 and survived at least one year after diagnosis. Of these patients, 1,619 developed tMDS/AML through 2014. When the researchers analyzed the risk of tMDS/AML by original cancer type, they found that risk was increased by 1.5-fold to more than 10-fold for 22 of the 23 solid cancer types investigated (all except colon cancer).

These findings expand the groups of survivors at risk of tMDS/AML following treatment with chemotherapy because, in the past, excess risks were established only after chemotherapy for cancers of the lung, ovary, breast, soft tissue, testis, and brain/central nervous system. In the present analysis, cumulative incidence of tMDS/AML was less than 1 percent at 10 years after chemotherapy for most solid cancer types. However, prognosis following tMDS/AML diagnosis was very poor.

Because information on the specific chemotherapy agents was not available in the SEER registry data, the researchers used the SEER–Medicare linked database to examine the patterns of use of specific chemotherapy agents during the same time period. Among 165,000 patients in the SEER–Medicare database who received initial chemotherapy for a first primary solid cancer during the study period, 2000–2013, there was a substantial rise in use of platinum-based chemotherapy agents, from 57 percent of patients in 2000–2001, to 81 percent of patients in 2012–2013. Platinum-based chemotherapy agents are known to increase risk of tMDS/AML.

“The most important message from this study is that, while advances in cancer treatment approaches have improved the prognosis for many types of cancer, the number of patients at risk of developing rare, therapy-related leukemia after cancer chemotherapy in the modern treatment era has markedly expanded,” Dr. Morton said. “Assessments of treatment risks and benefits should balance these risks and other adverse effects of chemotherapy against potential gains in survival following treatment for the initial solid cancer.”

The researchers wrote that their study shows that continued efforts to minimize exposure to leukemia-causing chemotherapy agents and to develop effective and less toxic chemotherapeutic approaches are critical going forward.

• Researchers reviewed data of over 245,000 UK individuals to assess how alcohol impacts aging.
• Shorter telomeres were found in those who drank heavily or had alcohol use disorder.
• No effect on telomeres was seen in light-to-moderate drinkers.
• Telomere length is linked to biological aging and disease onset. The pros and cons of drinking alcohol are frequently relayed, and there’s a new addition to the ever-growing list. Research conducted by Oxford Population Health, part of the University of Oxford, indicates excessive alcohol consumption can speed up the aging process at a biological level. The , published in Molecular Psychiatry, is the largest of its kind to date. It involved more than 245,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years old, with their data obtained from the UK Biobank. Three percent of participants were classed as ‘never drinkers’, four percent ‘previous drinkers’, and 93 percent ‘current drinkers’. Data on participants’ weekly alcohol consumption — self-reported when joining the Biobank — was used as the basis of an observational analysis. Researchers also used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether any genetic markers (that have been previously linked to AUD) might play a role in telomere length. The results? Observational analysis findings indicated that heavy alcohol drinkers and those with alcohol use disorder (AUD) were significantly more likely to have shorter telomeres — an essential part of our chromosomes linked to aging and the onset of various health concerns. Meanwhile, the MR analysis also found a strong link between telomere length and genetically-predicted AUD. The most influential gene was discovered to be AD1HB, which acts as an alcohol metabolizer in the body.

How much alcohol has an impact? The observational analysis found drinking more than 29 units each week was most detrimental. Compared to individuals enjoying six units weekly, this level of consumption was associated with telomere shortening equivalent to two years’-worth of aging. In layman’s terms, 29 units is equivalent to around 10 250ml-sized glasses of wine (with 12 percent alcohol by volume, ABV). If you’re a beer drinker, this equates to about 17 330ml-sized bottles (at five percent ABV). Meanwhile, in the MR analysis, drinking 32 units each week (as opposed to 10 units) was linked to telomere shortening akin to three years of aging. Those with a genetic disposition for AUD also showed a similar level of telomere damage. However, those who enjoy an occasional tipple with dinner probably don’t need to worry too much: the association between alcohol consumption and telomere length was only significant among participants who drank more than 17 units (around six 250ml glasses at 12 percent ABV) per week.

Essentially, “telomeres play an important role in keeping our genes intact and genome stable,” explained Dr Wei Cui, from the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology (IRDB) at Imperial College London. A bit like the ends of shoelaces, “you can think of telomeres like the protective ‘caps’ on the ends of our chromosomes,”said Matt Kaeberlein, PhD, professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington. “[These] are the structures into which our genetic material (our DNA) is organized in each cell.” “Chromosomes become slightly shorter with each cell division due to the way our DNA replicates, [and] the telomeres protect the important parts of our genome from being lost,” he continued. “But, eventually, the telomeres ‘run out’ and become so short that they give off a signal which causes the cells to stop dividing and become ‘senescent’ [biologically aged].” While Kaeberlein noted that discussion around the role of telomeres in aging “is still fairly controversial,” some studies have found associations between shorter telomeres with types of , , and .

Cells naturally divide in the body, which is the most common path to telomere shortening. However, other elements — such as , and chronic stress — have all been noted as possible influences. Another potential player — as highlighted by this research — is alcohol. Yet, how drinking booze directly influences telomeres isn’t entirely clear. “Our hypothesis is that, in the breakdown of ethanol (the main ingredient of alcohol), free radicals (unstable molecules that damage DNA) are produced,” shared Anya Topiwala, DPhil, a senior clinical researcher at Oxford Population Health and study lead. “As a double whammy, alcohol reduces antioxidants — the natural defense mechanism for free radicals.” Whatever the reason, it will likely be a while before the broader impacts are seen. “Telomere shortening does not affect normal cell physiological functions until one or more telomeres in a cell become very short,” said Cui. “In this aspect, I assume it is an accumulative effect.”

Knowing that shorter telomeres are linked to aging and certain diseases, you might wonder if you can ‘undo’ any damage that might have occurred. Cui stated the best approach to “slow down telomere shortening [is] by healthy living,” — and Kaeberlein agreed. “It’s likely that multiple lifestyle factors can impact telomere length in both a positive and negative direction,” he revealed. “Decreasing the amount of stress you experience correlates with longer blood telomeres. Sleep, exercise, and nutrition likely also influence blood telomere length.” For example, studies have found higher intakes of and may positively affect telomere length, while a suggested vitamins C and E may also be of benefit.",0
940,"With falls causing millions of injuries in older adults each year, it is an increasingly important public health concern. Older adults living with dementia have twice the risk of falling and three times the risk of incurring serious fall-related injuries, like fractures, compared to those without dementia. For older adults with dementia, even minor fall-related injuries can lead to hospitalization and nursing home admission. A new study from researchers in Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions, has shed light on the many and varied fall-risk factors facing older adults in community-living environments.

Recently published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, the research led by Safiyyah Okoye, PhD, an assistant professor at Drexel, and Jennifer L. Wolff, PhD, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, examined a comprehensive set of potential fall-risk factors -- including environmental factors, in addition to health and function -- in older community-living adults in the United States, both with and without dementia.

""Examining the multiple factors, including environmental ones like a person's home or neighborhood, is necessary to inform fall-risk screening, caregiver education and support, and prevention strategies for this high-risk population of older adults,"" said Okoye.

Despite awareness of this elevated risk, there are very few studies that have examined fall-risk factors among people with dementia living in a community setting (not nursing homes or other residential facilities). The studies that do exist, overwhelmingly focus on health and function factors. According to the authors, this is the first nationally representative study to compare a comprehensive set of potential risk factors for falls for older Americans living with dementia to those without dementia.

The research team examined data from the 2015 and 2016 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a population-based survey of health and disability trends and trajectories of adults 65 and older in the U.S. They were able to obtain potential sociodemographic, health and function predictors of falls, as well as potential social and physical environmental predictors.

Data from NHATS showed that nearly half (45.5%) of older adults with dementia had experienced one or more falls in 2016, compared to less than one third (30.9%) of older adults without dementia.

Among older adults living with dementia, three characteristics stood out as significantly associated with a greater likelihood of falls: a history of falling the previous year; impaired vision; and living with others (versus alone). For older adults without dementia, financial hardship, a history of falling, fear of falling, poor lower extremity performance, depressive symptoms and home disrepair were strongly associated with increased risk of falls.

While prior history of falling and vision impairment are well-known risk factors for falls among older adults in general; the researchers' findings indicate that these were strong risk factors for falls among people living with dementia. According to the team, this suggests that people living with dementia should be assessed for presence of these characteristics. If they're present, the individuals should receive further assessment and treatment, including examining their feet and footwear, assessing their environment and ability to carry out daily living activities, among other items.

The finding that older adults living with dementia who lived with a spouse or with non-spousal others had higher odds of experiencing a fall, compared to those who lived alone, highlights that caregiver support and education are understudied components of fall prevention programs for older adults with dementia who live with family caregivers, and deserve greater attention from clinicians, researchers and policy makers.

""Overall, our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding and addressing fall-risk among older adults living with dementia,"" said Okoye. ""It confirms that fall-risk is multidimensional and influenced by environmental context in addition to health and function factors.""

The results of the study indicate the need to further investigate and design fall-prevention interventions, specifically for people living with dementia.

""To decrease the high rates of falls among older adults with dementia, additional tailored fall-risk screening and fall-prevention interventions should be developed and tested,"" said Okoye.",0

958,"Brain “relay” also key to holding thoughts in the mind

Long assumed to be a mere “relay,” an often-overlooked egg-like structure in the middle of the brain also turns out to play a pivotal role in tuning-up thinking circuity. A trio of studies in mice funded by the National Institutes of Health are revealing that the thalamus sustains the ability to distinguish categories and hold thoughts in mind.

By manipulating activity of thalamus neurons, scientists were able to control an animal’s ability to remember how to find a reward. In the future, the thalamus might even become a target for interventions to reduce cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, researchers say.

“If the brain works like an orchestra, our results suggest the thalamus may be its conductor,” explained Michael Halassa, M.D., Ph.D., of New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center, a BRAINS Award grantee of the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and also a grantee of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). “It helps ensembles play in-sync by boosting their functional connectivity.”

Three independent teams of investigators led by Halassa, Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., formerly of Columbia University, New York City, now NIMH director, in collaboration with Christoph Kellendonk, Ph.D. of Columbia, and Karel Svoboda, PhD, at Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, Virginia, in collaboration with Charles Gerfen, Ph.D., of the NIMH Intramural Research Program, report on the newfound role for the thalamus online May 3, 2017 in the journals Nature and Nature Neuroscience.

The prevailing notion of the thalamus as a relay was based on its connections with parts of the brain that process inputs from the senses. But the thalamus has many connections with other parts of the brain that have yet to be explored, say the researchers.

Two of the investigated a circuit that connects the mid/upper (mediodorsal) thalamus with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brain’s thinking and decision making center. Brain imaging studies have detected decreased connectivity in this circuit in patients with schizophrenia, who often experience working memory problems.

Halassa and colleagues found that neurons in the thalamus and PFC appear to talk back and forth with each other. They monitored neural activity in mice performing a task that required them to hold in mind information about categories, so that they could act on cues indicating which of two doors hid a milk reward.

Optogenetically suppressing neuronal activity in the thalamus blocked the mice’s ability to choose the correct door, while optogenetically stimulating thalamus neural activity improved the animals’ performance on the working memory task. This confirmed a previously known role for the structure, extending it to the specialized tasks Halassa and colleagues used and demonstrating for the first time a specific role in the maintenance of information in working memory.

What kind of information was the thalamus helping to maintain? The researchers found sets of neurons in the PFC that held in memory the specific category of information required in order to choose the correct door. They determined that the thalamus did not (at least in this case) relay such specific category information, but instead broadly provided amplification that was crucial in sustaining memory of the category in the PFC. It accomplished this by boosting the synchronous activity, or functional connectivity, of these sets of PFC neurons.

“Our study may have uncovered the key circuit elements underlying how the brain represents categories,” suggested Halassa.

Gordon and colleagues saw similar results when they tested how the same circuit controlled a mouse’s ability to find milk in a maze. The animals had to remember whether they had turned left or right to get their reward prior to a brief delay – and do the opposite. Also using optogenetics, the study teased apart differing roles for subgroups of PFC neurons and interactions with the brain’s memory hub, the hippocampus.

Thalamus inputs to the PFC sustained the maintenance of working memory by stabilizing activity there during the delay. “Top-down” signals from the PFC back to the thalamus supported memory retrieval and taking action. Consistent with previous findings, inputs from the hippocampus, were required to encode in PFC neurons the location of the reward – analogous to the correct door in the Halassa experiment.

“Strikingly, we found two separate populations of neurons in the PFC. One encoded for spatial location and required hippocampal input; the other was active during memory maintenance and required thalamic input,” noted Gordon. “Our findings should have translational relevance, particularly to schizophrenia. Further study of how this circuit might go awry and cause working memory deficits holds promise for improved diagnosis and more targeted therapeutic approaches.”

In their study, the Janelia team and Gerfen similarly showed that the thalamus plays a crucial role in sustaining short-term memory, by cooperating with the cortex through bi-directional interactions. Mice needed to remember where to move after a delay of seconds, to gather a reward. In this case, the thalamus was found to be in conversation with a part of the motor cortex during planning of those movements. Neuronal electrical monitoring revealed activity in both structures, indicating that they together sustain information held in the cortex that predicted in which direction the animal would subsequently move. Optogenetic probing revealed that the conversation was bidirectional, with cortex activity dependent on thalamus and vice versa.

“Our results show that cortex circuits alone can’t sustain the neural activity required to prepare for movement,” explained Gerfen. “It also requires reciprocal participation across multiple brain areas, including the thalamus as a critical hub in the circuit.”

959,"An experimental vaccine based on a virus that causes encephalitis in the wild appears to block tumor growth in some cases of advanced cancer, according to researchers at Duke University Medical Center. Scientists say the vaccine is able to stimulate an immune response, even in the face of profound immune system suppression, a condition most patients with advanced cancer experience.

Scientists removed the genes that enable the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus -- an alphavirus -- to replicate itself, and replaced them with genes that make the biomarker CEA, present in many malignant colon, breast and lung cells.

""Alphaviruses have been used before in designing treatments for infectious diseases, but we believe this is the first time one has been used in patients with cancer,"" said Michael Morse, MD, associate professor of medicine at Duke and the lead author of the study appearing online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

The Phase I/II study included 28 patients with advanced cases of lung, colon, breast, appendix or pancreatic cancers who had already been treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy, but whose cancers kept coming back.

Cancer vaccines, unlike traditional vaccines, are designed to boost the body's own immune system to recognize and destroy tumors, not prevent disease. Scientists often use genetically altered viruses as vaccines, stripping the virus of any harmful parts and inserting genes related to their anticancer strategy. But in many cases, the immune system still sees the incoming virus as a foreign invader and springs into action, generating antibodies and T cells that destroy it before it has a chance to do any good.

Based on earlier research, investigators at Duke believed that by using the alphavirus for Venezuelan equine encephalitis as a carrier they might be able to thwart that response.

""The beauty of alphaviruses is that they are naturally attracted to dendritic cells, cells that stimulate the production of large numbers of T cells and antibodies,"" says Morse. ""Essentially, we were hoping that once infected, the dendritic cells would activate T cells and antibodies to go after anything that had the tumor antigen CEA on it -- in this case, the quickly growing cancer cells.""

Participants received up to four injections plus booster shots of the vaccine over a period of three months. At the end of the study, two patients with no evidence of disease remained in remission; two patients were able to maintain stable disease, and one patient with pancreatic cancer saw a lesion in his liver disappear. The other patients in the trial did not respond to the therapy.

""Remember, these were patients with very advanced disease that nothing else had been able to stop,"" says Morse, a member of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center and a specialist in vaccine design. ""We believe that in this small number of patients, the vaccine was able to stimulate the body's defense system to destroy significant numbers of cancer cells despite the presence of an army of neutralizing antibodies and regulatory T cells.""

Morse says those who seemed to benefit the most were those who had the smallest amount of tumor. Because of this, he says his team is planning future trials that will test the vaccine in people with cancers that have been removed, but who are high risk of recurrence. Other trials will couple the vaccine with additional immune system stimulants such as interleukin-12 that may make the vaccine more powerful.

Grants from the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense supported the work.

Kim Lyerly, director of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center; Amy Hobeika, Takuya Osada, Donna Niedzwiecki, Gayathri Devi, Bruce Burnett, and Timothy Clay.

968,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — No effective therapy exists today for sepsis, an inflammatory storm that afflicts about 3 million Americans a year ― killing up to half. But now, investigators at Mayo Clinic’s campus in Florida have identified a key molecule that, in mice, helps protect the body’s central nervous system against the runaway inflammation.

Based on that discovery, published in Molecular Psychiatry, Mayo scientists are now on the hunt for an agent that pumps up that protective response against sepsis in humans and determine downstream pathways that can be augmented to prevent further central nervous system damage.

“Sepsis most often develops in the youngest and the oldest of us, when the immune system can respond abnormally,” says the study’s senior investigator, John Fryer, Ph.D., associate professor, Department of Neuroscience, at Mayo Clinic’s Florida campus. “By discovering a protein that keeps the central nervous system inflammatory response from sepsis in check, we now have a path to finding or developing a targeted agent that may substantially lower the high toll experienced every year from sepsis.”

A bacterial infection that sets off an overactive immune response is often the reason that sepsis develops, Dr. Fryer says. And while up to half of affected patients survive, many experience acute delirium and have substantially increased risk of long-lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments, he says.

“Few people realize how prevalent sepsis is and what a devastating immune reaction it causes. Our goal is to help the immune system react properly, and our discovery offers us an exciting prospective avenue for therapy,” says Dr. Fryer, who is also assistant dean of the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Scientists who have studied the protein identified in the study — lipocalin-2 — may be surprised to learn that it is not the villain some investigators believe it to be, he adds. “There has been the suggestion that lipocalin-2 is a neurotoxic molecule. We find it, in the right context, not to be not toxic at all, but highly protective.”

To conduct the study, Mayo Clinic investigators used a mouse model of sepsis to look at cytokines present in the central nervous system during sepsis. Cytokines are small proteins important for cell signaling.

Of more than 100 different cytokines, they found that lipocalin-2 was the most substantially elevated in the central nervous system as sepsis developed. To test the role of this molecule in the disease, researchers used a mouse without lipocalin-2 (a mouse in which the gene that produces lipocalin-2 is deleted) and found significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory proteins and significantly worsening behavioral side effects. Investigators then validated their finding that lipocalin-2 was key to mediating inflammation in sepsis through a genetic analysis that revealed a number of anti-inflammatory pathways that were being controlled by this molecule.

There are two potential clinical uses of this discovery, according to Dr. Fryer. One is that lipocalin-2 could be a marker for sepsis — meaning that it may be possible to test for lipocalin-2 in patients to see whether sepsis is developing. The other use is as an agent that boosts lipocalin-2 levels or augments its function in the brain may prevent central nervous system damage and cognitive impairments that occur after sepsis-like conditions, he says.

“We are combing the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) clinical collection of currently approved drugs to see if any work like lipocalin-2, and we are also screening drug libraries of novel compounds,” Dr. Fryer says. “We are also trying to understand the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of lipocalin-2 in this context.”

In addition, Dr. Fryer expresses particular appreciation for the generous philanthropic support from Gary and Marilyn Gilmer, “that had been dedicated to neurological complications following septic injury and came at the very time that we had been thinking of how we would like to pursue this project but had little funding to do so.”

969,"NIH study will assess biomarker as potential indicator of whether lower respiratory tract infections improve with antibacterial treatment

A new clinical trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, aims to determine whether low blood levels of the protein procalcitonin can reliably indicate whether a person’s lower respiratory tract infection will improve with antibiotic treatment.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can cause a variety of symptoms, including persistent coughing, wheezing, chest pain, fever, and rapid or difficult breathing. Healthcare providers often prescribe a course of antibiotics as standard treatment without knowing for certain whether an infection is bacterial or viral. Taking antibiotics for viral infections is not only ineffective but can also introduce potential side effects and promote antimicrobial resistance.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is normally produced by the healthy human body in minute quantities, and serves as a precursor to calcitonin, a hormone which helps regulate calcium levels. Currently, medical professionals are able to test patients’ blood for high PCT levels, which are an indicator of bacterial sepsis, a life-threatening complication of infection that triggers inflammation throughout the body. The researchers leading the new clinical trial theorize that low PCT levels in patients with LRTIs may indicate that the infection is viral, not bacterial.

“Healthcare providers and patients benefit from precise diagnostic tests to guide treatment decisions,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “An effective biomarker for confirming that a lower respiratory tract infection is viral and thus not treatable with antibiotics would be a significant development in our collective efforts to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics and combat antimicrobial resistance.”

The study is being led by principal investigator Ephraim Tsalik, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of medicine at Duke University and a physician at the Durham VA Health Care System in Durham, N.C. It will enroll patients 18 years of age or older with suspected LRTIs and low PCT blood levels (0.25 ng/mL or less). The patients’ blood will be tested for PCT levels using bioMérieux’s VIDAS® BRAHMS PCT™ test. After their PCT levels have been confirmed, as many as 420 patients will be randomized to receive either a 5-day regimen of the oral antibiotic azithromycin (500 mg as a single dose on day one followed by 250 mg once daily for four days) or placebo. Patients whose symptoms worsen will be immediately referred for appropriate care. At day five, all the patients will be evaluated for improvement in their symptoms. Additional follow-up with the patients will occur on days 11 and 28 to determine their health status.

If no significant difference in improvement rates between volunteers treated with azithromycin and those receiving placebo is found, this result will suggest that low PCT levels could indeed identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from antibiotic treatment. Conversely, if the volunteers given antibiotics tend to recover faster or better than those given placebo, the results will indicate that low PCT levels are not a reliable biomarker to guide the use of antibiotics for LRTIs.

The study, which is expected to conclude by 2020, was developed by the NIAID-supported Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) in collaboration with bioMérieux researchers and medical experts. It is being conducted through three NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units and three VA Health Care Systems, with a total of five sites enrolling participants in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas.

973,"New disease could provide insights into how the cell’s recycling system contributes to a healthy brain.

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have discovered a new neurological condition characterized by issues with motor coordination and speech. They report their findings in npj Genomic Medicine.

Scientists from NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) identified three children with the condition, two siblings and an unrelated child. The three children all had issues with motor coordination and speech, and one child had abnormalities in the cerebellum, the part of the brain involved in complex movement among other functions. Additionally, the children all had mutations in both copies of the ATG4D gene.

ATG4D aids in the cellular housekeeping process called autophagy, which cells use to break down and recycle damaged proteins and other defective pieces of the cell to stay healthy. Autophagy is a fundamental process used by cells throughout the body, but neurons are particularly dependent on autophagy for survival. However, little is known about how ATG4D contributes to healthy neurons.

The first inclination of ATG4D’s effects on brain health came from a 2015 study in which researchers identified a genetic neurological disease among Lagotto Romagnolo dogs, an Italian breed known for their fluffy coats and truffle-hunting abilities. The affected dogs had abnormal behavior, atrophy of the cerebellum, issues with motor coordination and eye movement and ATG4D mutations.

While this 2015 study invigorated research interest in ATG4D’s role in the brain, scientists had yet to connect ATG4D to any neurological disease in humans.

“Among genetic diseases, we’ve solved many of the lower hanging fruits,” said May Christine Malicdan, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI staff scientist and senior author of the study. “Now, we’re reaching for the higher fruits — genes like ATG4D that are more difficult to analyze — and we have the genomic and cellular tools to do so.”

Computational analyses predicted that the three children’s ATG4D mutations would produce dysfunctional proteins. However, three other genes in the human genome serve very similar roles to ATG4D, and in some cells, these other genes may compensate for a loss of ATG4D.

While all cells in the body share the same genome, some genes are more important for certain cells. When the researchers studied the children’s ATG4D mutations in skin cells, the variants did not affect the cells’ recycling process, but this may not be true in the brain.

“The brain is so complex, and neurons have very specialized functions. To fit those functions, different neurons use different genes, so changes in redundant genes can have major impacts in the brain,” said Malicdan.

To simulate cells that rely more heavily on ATG4D, the researchers deleted the similar genes in cells grown in the laboratory and then inserted the children’s ATG4D mutations. The researchers determined the cells with the children’s ATG4D mutations could not carry out the necessary steps for autophagy, indicating that the children’s symptoms are likely caused by insufficient cellular recycling.

Still, much about ATG4D remains unknown. “We have only a bird's eye view of many important cellular processes like autophagy,” said Malicdan. A rare disease that involves changes in one gene can help tease apart how that gene acts in a broadly important cellular process.

Other components of autophagy are involved in common neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Knowledge of this rare neurological disorder could lead to new avenues of research about ATG4D’s involvement in more common conditions.

“That’s the million-dollar question in rare disease research,” said Malicdan. “Rare diseases can help us understand biological pathways, so we can better understand how those pathways contribute to other rare and common conditions.”

NIH researchers and clinicians continue to work with the children in this study, and the researchers are aiming to identify more patients. Treatments are many steps away, but by learning more about ATG4D and autophagy, researchers may be able to develop new treatments for this condition and others involving autophagy pathways.

991,"NIH to fund seven Research Centers in Minority Institutions

The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), part of the National Institutes of Health, will fund seven new awards to support the Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Specialized Centers program. RCMI is designed to support institutional research capacity and foster the career development of new and early career investigators conducting minority health and health disparities research. The centers will share approximately $122 million over five years, pending available funds.

The RCMI program allows the promotion of science on minority health and health disparities, while increasing diversity among scientists, as well as supporting diversity in clinical studies. NIMHD is committed to supporting scientists at institutions that are historically committed to training populations underrepresented in science.

RCMI-funded institutions must offer doctoral degrees in the health professions or the sciences related to health, and have an historical and current commitment to educating underrepresented students. Centers must have an explicit focus on basic biomedical, behavioral, and/or clinical research.

The primary goals of the RCMI specialized centers are: to enhance institutional research capacity within the areas of basic biomedical, behavioral, and/or clinical research; enable investigators of all levels to become more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support, especially from NIH, particularly on diseases that disproportionately affect minority and other health disparity populations; foster environments conducive to career enhancement, with a special emphasis on development of new and early career investigators; enhance the quality of all scientific inquiry and promote research on minority health and health disparities; and establish sustainable relationships with community-based organizations that will partner with the RCMI institution.

“Institutions with historical commitment to diversity are essential to supporting scientific research and providing health care to underserved communities,” said NIMHD Director Dr. Eliseo J. Pérez-Stable. “These institutions are uniquely positioned to engage minority populations in research, and in the translation of research advances into culturally competent, measurable and sustained improvements in health outcomes.”

The seven RCMI grantees are:

Center for Reducing Health Disparities in Substance Abuse and HIV in South Florida

 Eric F. Wagner, Ph.D.

 Florida International University, Miami

1U54MD012393-01

The center will partner with communities in the Miami Dade region, which has a high prevalence of substance use and some of the highest HIV incidences in the country, particularly among underrepresented minorities, to develop a sustainable national clinical and behavioral research training program that addresses health inequities and disparities associated with these health problems.

The program will support four research projects addressing HIV/AIDS, prostate cancer, racial and ethnic differences in periodontal disease microbiomes, and adversity-driven chronic pain to advance fundamental understanding of these health disparities.

The center will conduct three innovative basic biomedical and behavioral research projects, along with health disparities research pilot projects with robust mentoring, leveraging resources and partnerships at community-based organizations and neighboring institutions in the Research Triangle area. The center will also promote a collaborative research environment conducive to career enhancement for postdoctoral trainees and NCCU faculty at all levels.

The center will increase research capacity in environmental and community health to address health disparities among diverse populations of the southwestern United States. Research projects will explore environmental factors and conditions that might lead to increased risk for health issues and disease transmission, as well as biological variables that may affect disease mortality in the underserved. Through community collaborations, SHERC will identify relevant strategies to enhance community assets and resilience to minimize the impacts of health disparities in the region.

The center will enhance its research infrastructure and increase the numbers and proficiency of minority scientists engaged in advanced biomedical research focused on health disparities, including those for HIV, obesity, and prostate cancer, all of which disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities, especially African Americans residing in the “Black Belt” counties of Alabama. The center will also engage local communities to better understand and address health issues that affect them.

The project is designed to advance “ola” (health in Hawaiian) for communities experiencing genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic disparities in health. The center will foster high-impact, team-science research addressing health disparities; strengthen and diversify the basic biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce and thinkforce focusing on health disparities; and enhance, consolidate and sustain core facilities and resources for health disparities research.

Center for Collaborative Research in Minority Health and Health Disparities

 Emma Fernández-Repollet, Ph.D.

 University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan

2U54MD007600-31

The center will support translational research projects in basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research that will provide different and innovative approaches to promoting minority health and health disparities research among early career investigators and students, enhancing participation of Hispanic patients in genomics studies, and providing novel interventions to reduce childhood obesity within and outside Puerto Rico.

995,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― People who have coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral artery disease often are prescribed a statin, a cholesterol-lowering drug that reduces the risk of heart attack or stroke.

In a recent publication in JAMA Network Open, Mayo Clinic researchers identify trends in statin use across the U.S. among people with these diseases, as well as among those who already had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Their data indicate that only about 60% of patients are getting the recommended therapy.

""Statins are one of the few key medical advancements in recent decades that contribute to the health of broad populations,"" says Xiaoxi Yao, Ph.D., a health sciences researcher at Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study. ""High cholesterol is very common, making statins relevant to many patients.""

""Dr. Yao and I were interested in understanding the trends and outcomes related to these medications over the past decade,"" says Peter Noseworthy, M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and senior author of the study. ""For such a widely used class of medication, this type of research is especially important because it helps us identify gaps for future practice improvement efforts.""

Statins have been around long enough that all are available in generic form. This was important to Drs. Yao and Noseworthy, and their research team, because prescription cost is a well-known barrier to medication adherence.

They also were interested in seeing if ACC/AHA guidelines implemented in 2013 had any noticeable effects on statin use for secondary prevention. Among people who already have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, secondary prevention refers to further exacerbation or adverse events. The guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for patients 75 or younger with this disease.

The researchers used deidentified data, including pharmacy and medical claims data, and linked electronic health records, from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. OptumLabs is a collaborative center for research and innovation co-founded by Optum Inc. and Mayo Clinic, and focused on improving patient care and patient value.

They examined the records of nearly 300,000 adults in the U.S. who had an initial atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event between 2007 and 2016. These were divided into three groups: coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease.

When people left the hospital or emergency department in 2007 following a first diagnosis in one of these categories, about half began taking statins within 30 days. By 2016, statin use increased to approximately 60%.

""Based on the guidelines, we hoped to see a much higher uptake among this entire group,"" says Dr. Noseworthy. ""Statin intolerance was only noted for 4%–5% of the patients, which means as many as 35% of patients are not receiving treatment according to the guidelines.""

By 2016, the researchers also noted substantial variance between diagnosis and likelihood of receiving statins after the event. While 80.9% of patients with coronary heart disease were given statins, only 65.8% of patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack received the drug. A scant 35.7% of people with peripheral artery disease were prescribed statins.

Also, there were unexpected disparities unrelated to diagnosis:
• People ages 65–75 were more likely to receive statins than those who were younger or older.
• High-intensity statins were prescribed most frequently to people 65 and younger and least frequently in people 75 or older.
• Women were less likely to receive statins than men, regardless of age or recommended dose intensity.

The team observed some other shifts in statin use between 2007 and 2016. Use of generic statins more than doubled as the cost decreased. In general, people were much more likely to consistently take statins a year after the initial event. However, the likelihood of patients continuing their prescribed statins was less likely among women. It also was less likely among people who were not white.

""Many patients with peripheral artery disease, ischemic stroke and TIA, and women, remain undertreated,"" says Dr. Yao. ""The improvement in statin use and adherence was quite modest, despite the substantial decrease in drug cost.""

The researchers also were able to analyze clinical outcomes. They saw the risk for patients to have a major adverse cardiac event within a year of the initial event decrease from 8.9% in 2007 to 6.5% in 2016. This corresponded mainly to the increase in the use and intensity of statin.

""The risk of adverse outcomes has decreased overall. However, it is apparent that major treatment gaps exist in our country,"" says Dr. Noseworthy. ""Although the guidelines recommend statins for stroke, TIA and peripheral artery disease, there appears to be an unwillingness to consider these and cardiovascular disease equally treatable with statins.""

""Gaps in both prescribing and continuation of statins for at least a year after discharge among women, and Black, Hispanic and Asian people mean that they will be more likely to experience avoidable adverse outcomes,"" says Dr. Yao. ""If your physician prescribes statins, please adhere to the drugs,"" she says. ""Some people say, 'I took the drug for a while, but nothing happened, so I stopped.' A statin is a drug to prevent cardiac events, stroke and death. So 'nothing happened' is actually the goal.""

""Most physicians would likely prescribe statins for patients with a heart attack, and perhaps other incidents of cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Noseworthy. ""However, in this large group of Americans, we saw that many patients with peripheral artery disease, ischemic stroke and TIA remain undertreated. We need to increase statin use in these patients.""

996,"A new study has found that walking can ward off knee pain for people with osteoarthritis. This condition affects more than 32 million adults in the United States.

As a form of exercise, walking traditionally has been promoted as benefitting your heart. Lately, it has been linked with battling depression and cognitive impairment as well. The new study, published by Wiley Online Library, suggests that walking could also help prevent joint discomfort.

“In individuals 50 years old with knee osteoarthritis, walking for exercise was associated with less development of frequent knee pain,” the authors wrote. “These findings support that walking for exercise should be encouraged for people with knee osteoarthritis.”

The study began in 2004, looking at more than 1,000 people over age 50 who had osteoarthritis in the knee, the most common type in the country. Participants reported how much they exercised, symptoms of their osteoarthritis, and pain levels. After four years, more than a third, or 37%, who didn’t walk for exercise experienced frequent pain; just 26% of those who walked experienced the same pain.",0
997,"TikTok’s ‘Shy Girl Workout’ trend may be just the thing you need to help tackle your gymtimidation. Pedro Merino/Getty Images
• ‘Shy Girl’ workouts are proving popular on social media platforms like TikTok.
• The trend includes demonstrations of simple, easy-to-replicate exercises that can be performed with minimal equipment.
• These workouts are said to help gym beginners overcome the fear and anxiety that accompanies working out around others.
• Experts believe the trend can be beneficial but advise gym users to progress to more complex workouts over time. Have you ever walked into a busy gym and felt intimidated by all the scary-looking equipment? Perhaps you’ve avoided going to the gym at all for this very reason. If working out around others is a source of anxiety for you, then a new trend, known as the ‘Shy Girl’ workout, may be for you. The trend has been gaining traction on TikTok recently with the #shygirlworkout hashtag amassing over 315 million views on the social media platform. The trend sees experienced gym goers, fitness influencers and PTs demonstrate beginner-friendly workouts. Proponents say it can take away some of the fear people experience when starting out at the gym by focusing on easy-to-replicate exercises and shorter workout routines. Research suggests that many people experience “gymtimidation” and women in particular are likely to face anxiety about working out around others. A poll commissioned by Sure Women found that, of the 2,000 women surveyed, one in four shy away from exercise for fear of being judged. A third of the respondents were worried that other gym users would view them as a novice. The Shy Girl Workout trend promises to quell these fears. Can it really ease your gym anxiety, and make working out around others something to be enjoyed rather than feared?

“The ‘Shy Girl’ workout trend utilizes very basic movements and minimal kit, most often just a set of light to moderate weight dumbbells,” explains Brahm Gallagher, a personal trainer, and former US Army fitness instructor. “This can ensure new gym goers aren’t overwhelmed by the big machines or big groups of people posing and/or monopolizing certain equipment.” In the past, you might have spotted fitness influencers performing complex movements with heavy weights and found this off-putting. In contrast, ‘Shy Girl’ workouts are made up of simple exercises that you can quickly learn to perform. Many of these are isolation exercises; a form of movement that works one muscle at a time. (Think push-ups, shoulder presses, and crunches.) Gallagher says this allows gym newbies to become more comfortable with basic weight resistance movements.

‘Shy Girl’ workouts can help build confidence while improving fitness These types of workouts can also help you develop confidence in the gym and allows you to become aware of what muscles you’re using during each movement. Psychologist and personal trainer Anna Sergent says not only is it easier to learn these movements, but it’s also easier to build on them. “As you focus on one body part, you have a greater capacity to remember the correct posture, form, and technique,” she explains. “Once you’ve learned to perform these simple exercises it can be a fun challenge to add another muscle group to the exercise making it a compound movement.” Simple movements aside, Shy Girl Workouts typically require less equipment and usually mean you take up less space in the gym too. “This style of workout can be completed in one area so there’s no need to move around the gym a lot. You won’t need to share equipment with others or interact with other gym-goers, either,” Sergent notes.

So, do the experts think this style of workout is helpful when it comes to quelling gymtimidation? Sergent says it can be incredibly beneficial for those who prefer to take their time and ease themselves into exercising, as well as those who want to follow their own exercise pace. Add to that, it could help you find a love of exercise that you didn’t know you had. “By listening to your body and mind when it comes to exercising you may discover that it is a lot of fun instead of a chore,” she points out. Sergent’s only caveat is that once you’ve mastered ‘Shy Girl’ workouts it’s important to increase the intensity and set new goals to continue progressing on your fitness journey. “Eventually you’ll need to progress from simple or isolation exercises to more complex and difficult exercises. If the exercises are kept on the same level the progress will stagnate and you may get bored,” she notes. ‘Shy Girl’ workouts are beginner-friendly, and so it stands to reason that once you’ve passed the beginner phase you should move on to something new to ensure your body remains challenged. Gallagher agrees and says progression is key but believes ‘Shy Girl’ workouts can be an excellent starting point in terms of confidence. “By focusing on simple movements and isolation exercises there is a sharp drop in perceived imposter syndrome that can happen in a gym, and limited movements equate to limited opportunities to perform exercises incorrectly,” he says.

A personal trainer may be a better fit for some beginners While ‘Shy Girl’ workouts can help some people take their first steps on a new fitness journey, Gallagher believes some beginners may fair better with a personal trainer (PT). “Not everything seen on social media is what you should be doing, depending on experience or fitness level,” he points out. “If all else fails and your fears are still rampant don’t be afraid to ask for help. PTs are there because they want to help people feel better, move better, and look better,” he surmises. What else can you do to feel more comfortable at the gym? Sergent says wearing gym clothes that make you feel confident, bringing along a friend, and making sure to visit the gym before signing up can all help you conquer gymtimidation. Lastly, if you’re new to the gym, Gallagher says, be proud of yourself. “You’ve already taken the hardest step by starting,” he points out. “The best advice is to bear in mind why you are training. Why did you start? What are your goals? What can you achieve if you stick to a routine and don’t quit?” When you combine this attitude with accessible routines, like a ‘Shy Girl’ workout, you may be more likely to stick with it. As the adage goes, “You don’t have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great.”",0

38,"""‘Even if children and adolescents and people in their 20s are infected, it is naturally mild or asymptomatic,’ Japanese drug bulletin Med Check said. ‘It is a ridiculous to consider vaccination for school children.’

OSAKA, Japan (LifeSiteNews) – COVID vaccines may pose at least a seven times higher risk of death than the virus itself for people in their 20s, a Japanese medical bulletin warns.

A review in the most recent issue of Med Check, a bimonthly bulletin published by the Japan Institute of Pharmacovigilance (NOPJIP) as a member of the International Society of Drug Bulletins (ISDB), found that the death risk of the jabs may even be as high as 40 times greater for young people.

Med Check cited three reports of individuals between the ages of 20 and 29 who died within days or weeks of vaccination, estimating the death rate for that age group at 3.2 per 1 million. One of the apparent vaccine deaths was that of a 27-year-old professional baseball player, who collapsed eight days after getting jabbed and died after a month-long battle in a hospital.

The bulletin noted that the number of deaths may be higher, in part because the Japanese government only requires reports of suspected vaccine injuries within 28 days of injection. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare received a total of 1,308 reports of deaths after COVID vaccination by October 15.

Even with just three cases, the risk of a fatal reaction to the vaccine significantly outpaced the danger of the virus for young people, who have a 0.6-0.8 per 1 million chance of dying from the disease in Japan, according to Med Check. Just seven of 11.8 million Japanese people in their 20s died of COVID by June 2021, and 10 died by mid-August.

Risk of death from vaccination was more than seven times higher as of June, and nearly five times higher by August 11, compared to the risk presented by coronavirus, Med Check determined. Over several years, death risk for vaccination among those in their 20s could range as high as 40 times greater than for COVID-19.

Med Check also pointed out that there were no COVID deaths in Japan under the age of 20 until September 2021. “If children in this age group are vaccinated, it may cause death,” the bulletin warned.

“Even if children and adolescents and people in their 20s are infected, it is naturally mild or asymptomatic because they have less SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 than adults especially old people. It is a ridiculous to consider vaccination for school children.”

Between 0.00 and 0.03 percent of COVID cases in the United States under age 18 have resulted in deaths, and zero healthy children between the ages of 5 and 18 died of the virus during the first 15 months of the pandemic in Germany, a recent study found.

The survival rate for COVID-19 has been estimated at no lower than 99.7 percent for all age groups under 60 years old.

Med Check’s analysis echoes similar assessments by other experts, such as Dr. Jessica Rose, a viral immunologist who told an FDA panel in September that the jab’s dangers “outweigh any potential benefit,” citing a “highly anomalous” rise in vaccine injury reports due to the injections.

“We could end up killing thousands of our children with these safety untested vaccines,” health researcher and former Trump official Dr. Paul Elias Alexander likewise warned in an article for LifeSiteNews. “There is no proper safety data, either medium or long term, and parents must stand up now and say NO!”

40,"Research from the Jefferson Weinberg ALS Center has identified a new mechanism by which the buildup of toxic proteins disrupts neuronal transmission in patients with ALS. The study focuses on the GA protein, which forms aggregates and causes toxicity that can kill neurons. The research found that GA aggregates are not mobile and do not lead to an influx of calcium ions or disrupt the electrical balance of the neuron. However, they do result in a reduction in a key protein called SV2, which regulates the release of neurotransmitters. This reduction in SV2 impairs the neuron's ability to detect and send signals, preventing it from properly communicating with muscles. The researchers found that replenishing the SV2 protein can combat the most detrimental effects of the protein buildup but does not decrease toxicity or prevent cell death. Further studies will determine if SV2 can prolong muscle strength and slow disease progression in C9orf72‐ALS patients.",1

53,"""Dr. Anthony Fauci and the rest of President Biden's COVID advisors have been proven wrong about ""the science"" of COVID vaccines yet again. After telling Americans that vaccines offer better protection than natural infection, a new study out of Israel suggests the opposite is true: natural infection offers a much better shield against the delta variant than vaccines.

The study was described by Bloomberg as ""the largest real-world analysis comparing natural immunity - gained from an earlier infection - to the protection provided by one of the most potent vaccines currently in use."" A few days ago, we noted how remarkable it was that the mainstream press was finally giving voice to scientists to criticize President Biden's push to start doling out booster jabs. Well, this study further questions the credibility of relying on vaccines, given that the study showed that the vaccinated were ultimately 13x as likely to be infected as those who were infected previously, and 27x more likely to be symptomatic.

Alex Berenson, a science journalist who has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of vaccines and masks at preventing COVID, touted the study as enough to ""end any debate over vaccines v natural immunity.""

1/ Wow. New Israeli preprint shows natural immunity to #SARSCoV2 is FAR superior to the artificial kind - vaccinated people were 13x as likely to be infected and 27x to have symptomatic infections as a matched cohort that was previously infected. And this is with Delta dominant. pic.twitter.com/hhD9h0vyMS — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) August 25, 2021

2/ The paper also shows that offering previously infected people one dose slightly reduced their infection risk (though not enough to outweigh side effects, I would argue). Along with the other emerging data, this paper should end any debate over vaccines v natural immunity… — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) August 25, 2021

Here's an excerpt from a report by Science Magazine:

The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher.

This time, the data leave little doubt that natural infection truly is the better option for protection against the delta variant, despite the fact that the US won't acknowledge the already infected as having antibodies protecting them from the virus.

As the first country to achieve widepsread coverage by the vaccine, Israel is now in an unthinkable situation: daily case numbers have reached new record levels as the delta variant penetrates the vaccines' protection like a hot knife slicing through butter.

Source: Bloomberg

At the very least, the results of the study are good news for patients who have already successfully battled COVID but show the challenge of relying exclusively on immunizations to move past the pandemic.

""This analysis demonstrated that natural immunity affords longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization due to the delta variant,"" the researchers said.

Unfortunately, the study also showed that any protection is time-limited. Protection offered by natural infection wanes over time, just like the protection afforded by vaccines: The risk of a vaccine-breakthrough delta case was 13x higher than the risk of developing a second infection when the original illness occurred during January or February 2021. That's significantly more than the risk for people who were ill earlier in the outbreak.

What's more, giving a single shot of the vaccine to those who had been previously infected also appeared to boost their protection. Still, the data don't tell us anything about the long-term benefits of booster doses.

This latest data showing the vaccines don't offer anywhere near the 90%+ protection that was originally advertised by the FDA after the emergency authorization. Other studies are finding harmful side effects caused by the mRNA jabs are also more prevalent than previously believed.

107,"""A world-renowned psychiatrist says an evil cabal of powerful elites, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, tech billionaire Bill Gates, and World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab, created the COVID pandemic to push the deadly vaccines on an unsuspecting public, and usher in a “new world order.”

Dr. Peter Breggin argues in a new book that the U.S. government began its vaccine rollout by enticing people to get the experimental shot using various bribes, then moved on to forcing the injections on unwilling people by threatening their employment, imposing higher health insurance rates, making it more difficult for them to travel, and even denying them health care.

Breggin, 85, says we are in the midst of worldwide propaganda campaign designed to make people feel helpless, docile, and obedient. He laid out in detail what his extensive research into the pandemic has uncovered during an interview on Dr. Joseph Mercola’s podcast, last month. According to Breggin, “we are being oppressed by evil people” who are working toward a worldwide totalitarian regime.

Breggin is known as “the conscience of psychiatry” because of his opposition to shock treatment and lobotomies in the 1970s. His campaign against psychosurgery led to reform in the psychiatric profession, including the abolition of lobotomies and other experimental psychosurgeries. Breggin has written more than a dozen bestselling books on psychiatry and the drug industry.

His latest book, COVID-19 and the Global Predators, hit bookstores on September 30.

“Don’t get scared, get angry. Don’t get demoralized. They want that. There’s a whole school of public health that talks about how to intimidate and engender fear to get people to do what you want. It’s called “fear appeal,” he said. “So we have to know that there’s a war against us. They have a stealth war against us. So be proud. Be an American, be a patriot, stand up for liberty.”

The psychiatrist stressed the goal of the globalists is to make people feel weak and helpless in the midst of the pandemic.

“It’s extremely important to get over what essentially is an attempt to make us all feel helpless and obedient and docile,” Breggin told Mercola. “We have to know who are the masters driving this. We also need to understand the mechanisms of what is essentially a rein of terror. We’re looking at a revolution against us that wants to make us feel helpless like children again.”

Throughout the interview, Breggin stressed that people should stop wondering why global elites are inflicting harmful and destructive policies on the public.

“In psychotherapy, we often see people who have been terribly, terribly abused by their parents, but they cannot face it. They can’t understand it. They can’t identify it as evil,” he explained. “They can’t say it was evil for my father to sexually abuse me, that it was evil for my mother to participate and go along with it.”

But it was evil, the psychiatrist said. “It was evil in the extreme when you see people who have been ritually abused,” he said, noting that there are many cases in which families have abused their children “in ritualistic fashion.”

“For the outsider, often, it’s impossible to believe that this even takes place because we human beings just can’t bear to look at evil,” he said. “We can’t bear to think that there are people out to harm us, and manipulate us. We can’t bear to think there are people different from us—people who actually take pleasure in injury and domination—literally pleasure from it, the way we might [take pleasure] from a hug.”

The doctor said that it was important to disabuse people of the notion that the pandemic is a result of bad luck. The terrible state of affairs throughout the globe is not the result of chance, he maintained, stressing that people need to stop questioning why policymakers are making so many counterproductive decisions.

“It’s time to face it and get rid of the idea that this is chance, or crazy, or bizarre, or makes no sense,” Breggin said.

“How does it make sense that they’re absolutely ignoring that in America now, we have over 13,000 reports of death (to the CDC) from the vaccine, and no one is investigating it?” he asked.

Breggin pointed out that in past years, if there had been only 200 deaths from all of the vaccines put together, it would have been considered a catastrophe.

“Now we have a vaccine that has more deaths than every other vaccine all put together. So how can we ignore that?” he continued.

Meanwhile, Breggin noted, there there are highly inflated numbers of COVID deaths that have been falsified by manipulating the reporting mechanisms.

He said rather than “crazy,” what is being done “makes perfect sense if you’re trying to intimidate and overwhelm a population.”

“You exaggerate the danger that’s out there—the terror—and make it into a horror show,” he explained. “And then you think, what is their goal? They don’t want any early treatments at all—why don’t they want early treatments?”

Breggin pointed out that two treatments that have been proven to be helpful in fighting COVID—Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine—are inexpensive, and safe to use.

“Why would they stop that?” he asked. “Well, they’re already exaggerating the deaths, and they’re already minimizing the harm done by the vaccines, so could this be, from the start, all about the vaccine?”

Breggin declared that “the spike protein is the spearhead of an assault on humanity that has nothing to do with COVID-19 whatsoever,” and that COVID-19 was created “in order to vastly increase the wealth of numerous institutions, numerous individuals of many, many different stripes—many of them unfortunately originating from America—who are working in collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party, as the book demonstrates painfully accurately—to increase this vast exploitation of the world.”

Breggin said it was no accident that western Democracies like the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia, were being “humiliated” by particularly draconian totalitarian policies.

“Well, the Chinese have been sinking their teeth into us for a long, long time because we are the seat of liberty,” the doctor explained, noting that several third world countries have been allowed to fight the pandemic using Ivermectin because the global forces are focused primarily on destroying countries that are the most free.

“This is terrifying folks, but it shouldn’t make you anxious, afraid, guilty, ashamed, helpless,” he said. “It should arouse you to look with reason to what in the world is happening in the world.”

Breggin said his book explains in detail how this evil was allowed to take hold.

“It has an ancient history,” he noted, citing Caesar, Genghis Khan, certain African tribes, and the Inca empire.

“There’s always been this tendency to keep people in thrall, he explained. “What’s happening to us now is not new. It’s not unexpected or unheard of. It’s how humanity has always lived.”

Decades in the making, the globalist plot to create a new world order gained traction during the Obama years.

“In 2010, Bill Gates pronounced ‘the decade of the vaccine,’ and who do you think was right with him as a partner in the declaration? Anthony Fauci.”

He said Gates founded the “Decade of Vaccines” project in 2010, assembling a committee made up of globalists—including Fauci— to implement a Global Vaccine Action Plan.

“The world today has 6.8 billion people, Gates said in a Ted Talk in 2010. “That’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”

In 2015, Breggin continued, Gates held an event that was “in anticipation of a pandemic,” that made it apparent that they were working on creating a pandemic and a deadly vaccine to go along with it.

“You get the vaccine. If it doesn’t kill you, you get COVID and get very sick,” he explained.

The doctor said he unearthed a 2015 paper that showed funding from Fauci’s NIAID, to a collaborative study with the top two scientists at the Wuhan lab. Breggin stressed that Fauci had to know that he was funding a potential pandemic virus being conducted by the Communist Chinese government.

“One thing folks don’t know is there’s never been a SARS-CoV virus found in nature. Never—But there are untold numbers of SARS-CoV viruses floating around in labs,” he said. “So, here we have China and America making what are essentially biological weapons, the excuse being, hey, we’re going to make vaccines.”

But the vaccines weren’t designed to work, he continued. “They know it because the coronavirus mutates all the time. You make a vaccine for the Chinese virus, it’s not going to last long because it will just help force these mutations to come out.”

Breggin said he discovered on Klaus Schwab’s website that Gates in 2016 had created a 65-page business plan for the next pandemic.

“That business plan lays out everything that is happening to us now,” he said. “In particular, it lays out that Bill Gates will be working with CEPI, an organization he founded in 2017 with Klaus Schwab, who touted “the Great Reset” in 2020.

He said Gates at that time was already working with the drug companies to develop what would become to be known as “Operation Warp Speed.”

“Poor, deluded Trump—I love Donald Trump—in a way, deeply for what he has done for America First, and liberty, but he was duped. He couldn’t believe he was duped by everybody.

Breggin said Trump thought he had come up with Operation Warp Speed, but he was only implementing what Gates had come up with in 2017.

In July 2017, based on their plan, Bill Gates’ organization CEPI made a PowerPoint for the World Health Organization pointing out that the drug companies will suffer no losses during the coming pandemic.

“It says, basically that Bill Gates—he’s mentioned by name—will be involved in the organization of the generation of the actual vaccines, and all the wealth working with various people and that the World Health Organization will take over all the rest,” he explained.

“Imagine that. They have no powers like this, legally. They’re not the rulers of the world. They’re not the courts or the congresses of the world. They’re making this up for themselves because they have so much power,” Breggin said.

“Behind the World Health Organization is the U.N. Behind the U.N. and the World Health Organization is Communist China’s huge power, huge power. They announce that the World Health Organization will then take the scientific side of it and own that, and set the standard for

medicine, for the vaccines, for all that stuff.”

Breggin continued:

If you want to know, how does a Reign of Terror occur overnight? You organize vast businesses, you organize the government agencies, you organize all these people. You get a powerful leader

like Bill Gates, because he has money everywhere. By the way, he funds World Health Organization, not just through the Bill and Melinda Gates. You’ll find out in the book there’s three foundations he funds that are giving money to the World Health Organization. Now, if you look at 2017 and who is partnering with Bill Gates, 2016, ’17, you look at the two documents that are on my website or you read the book, it’s all in the book, who is working, in

2016 and ’17, announced as partners with CEPI, with Bill Gates, with Klaus Schawb, with the drug companies? Well, you find out the drug companies are, but this is the part you’re not going

believe until you read it. Partners include the FDA, CDC, even BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), and that awful person named Bright, B-R-I-G-H-T, from BARDA. The

big government agencies, NIH (National Institutes of Health) and NIAID are there. They’re all there working with Bill Gates and CEPI in 2016, ’17, and is planning meetings, and BARDA remains on his planning board with Rick Bright.

Breggin explained that Rick Bright was “the key man in the deep state” who prevented President Trump from opening up repurposed drug treatments in America, which arguably led to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.

He explained that the reason the early treatments were shot down was that we were supposed to be in “the Decade of Vaccine.”

“That’s all it was ever about,” he argued. “It was never about anything else.”

Everything that’s happening to us was developed and planned ahead of time. Now, people say, ‘We don’t understand,’ and that’s really, almost everybody thinks that there was no animal testing of the vaccines, there wasn’t time, and blah, blah, blah. Animal testing of these vaccines go back to the early 2020s. What am I saying? 2008, 2010, you’ll find it in the book. What they continually found is that any vaccine, including, because several of the studies were about RNA or DNA vaccines, that any coronavirus vaccine for SARS-CoV—because remember, they’re creating SARS-CoVs in the lab, lots of them, all kinds, so they can experiment with the vaccines. You know what they use? They use what Ginger calls, my wife calls “Frankenmice.” You take a poor mouse and you develop it abnormally so that it has human lung epithelia, and then you can

see what happens to the mouse, how these things kill the mice. They find that, first of all, the mutations are so rapid, it’s going to be a problem, but worse than that, the vaccines that they do

give to the mice end up making them susceptible to horrible outcomes, if they actually get COVID. They don’t get very good protection, and when they get COVID, they get very, very

sick and many of them die. Then you ask yourself, “This was known?” Yes. How well-known? In 2020, while Operation Warp Speed is going on and they’re rushing these human experiments, a paper comes out from independent people in a major journal, through Fauci funding. He probably funded it without knowing what was going to happen, or he didn’t care, saying these vaccines, all of them, not just

the mRNA and the DNA, but even the killed vaccines, they’re too dangerous to even try on humans. This comes out in 2020. You’ll find it in the book.

Breggin told Mercola that the globalists left a massive paper trail because they spread many memorandums of understanding to a lot of different groups.

It’s systematic, and public health people have always been totalitarian in nature. I mean, you read a compendium of public health writings, and it’s all about public health people telling the communities what they must do come the next public health threat. They don’t say, “Preserve the Bill of Rights.” No. They don’t say, “Make sure we check this out in the courts.” Or, “We have a body supervising us for our ethics, and to protect the folks.” No, no, no. They’re, by nature, a lot of public health people, certainly the ones that rise to the top, which is generally the case in institutions. In institutions, the cream doesn’t rise to the top, but people who will do anything to get to the top rise to the top. That’s the basic situation.

The doctor stressed there is nothing wrong with Americans who question everything now, and don’t trust the vaccines.

You look back and you see what’s going on and what happened, and that helps you see it’s not you, so there’s nothing wrong with half of America. There’s nothing wrong with those of us who are patriotic. There’s nothing wrong with those of us who believe in God. There’s nothing wrong with those of us who really admire the founders of the country, even though they were human beings and they had corrupt, horrible practices like slavery, but they had these amazing ideas. Many of them were very great and good men and women, Abigail and John Adams, Martha and George Washington. Strong, devoted people who risked their entire lives and fortunes to give us a free nation. We need to know what happened. We are being oppressed by evil people. Nothing is by chance. We might as well be children being tormented and turned into helpless beings. We have to say to

each other, “No more. No more helplessness. No more lamenting. No more complaining. No more saying, ‘What’s happening to us?'” It’s very clear what’s happening to us. It’s the age-old tendency for power to rise to the top and to abuse everybody again, only now it’s high-tech, and now they have these fake vaccines that are sort of high-tech, and so on. It’s the same old scaring

the hell out of us by all the methods that Joe has been talking about so much and I’ve been talking about so much. We won’t name all those methods again, but they’re all calculated to cow

us, and so we can look at this and not say, “What they’re doing is crazy.” No, it’s not crazy. It’s intentional, and purposeful and we must stand up to it. Yeah, and I really want to help people replace the fear and confusion, like, “How could they do this?” The worst thing you can say to yourself is, “How could they do this? What are they doing

to me?” I remember when the diaries of some of the people, the leaders in the Warsaw Ghetto . . . They weren’t really leaders. The leaders were fighting and dying in the streets against the Nazis

in the Warsaw Ghetto, slowing down their progress and tying up large numbers of troops. The rabbis, the intellectuals, they were saying, “God, why have you done this to us? Why have you

done-” What do you mean, “Why?” This is the history of the world. I mean, read the Bible. The first family, the one son kills the other over jealousy, lies to the father. This is the history of the

world. Stop lamenting, stop complaining. Be joyful, and I mean joyful. We won’t always be joyous – be joyful that you are in a moment of time when you can help turn the tide again the way our founders did. We really have an opportunity to get together, create our own institutions, fight back, take big risks. Do you know the founders of our country, each and every one who signed the Declaration of Independence, consciously knew that they had created King George’s hit list. Every single one of them knew that if the war was lost, they’d be sought out and hanged. King George promised it when he saw the list. My emphasis about, it’s going to get worse. My emphasis is, that’s the plan. The plan always starts with one piece of oppression, two pieces. They work you up, like the proverbial frog in the hot

water, which is probably not a true story, but that’s the metaphor, until you’re cooked, boiled, so it’s inevitable, folks. Don’t wait for it to end. Whoever’s behind Joe, whether it’s his wife, or

Barack Obama. I don’t know why we don’t know. I don’t know who’s not looking hard in that area. I’m sure there’d be a way to find out who’s behind Joe, because it’s not Joe. There’s nothing

inside of Joe much now, but this is the plan. It’s not going to just get better by itself, absolutely will not.

Breggin predicted that America will see its own French Revolution-style “Reign of Terror.”

“It inevitably goes that way until there’s either a fight back or people become so docile that they only need occasional examples of terrorization,” he said. “We have to fight back. I’ve never put it so clearly in my life, folks, but there’s no doubt about it. This is the situation. I’m not talking about violence. I think we first have to work ourselves up to see if we can do this with just plain dissent. Be like Gandhi, be like Martin Luther King, and take brave risks. I think that’s where we have to go.”""",1

Anne Reed of Operation Rescue reported last week that recently released documents from Pfizer that were submitted to the FDA prior to approving their COVID-19 vaccine in early 2021 showed that 82% – 97% of the documented pregnancy outcomes resulted in death in their post-marketing analysis.

This is more evidence that Pfizer and the FDA colluded together to conceal damaging data related to the roll out of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.

Back in May of 2021, Operation Rescue published a report from a whistleblower who had examined the Pfizer documents submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use in the UK back in December of 2020, and among those documents (which we assume were also submitted to the FDA but not yet made public) were the results of animal trials showing serious birth defects occurred in rat specimens injected with the vaccines. See:

When the EMA originally authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, they included a warning about injecting child-bearing women:

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy. For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used during breast-feeding. Fertility It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility. (Source.)

However, when the FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines shortly after the EMA, in December of 2020, they did NOT include any warnings for pregnant and child-bearing women. See:

As of the 5/20/2022 release of VAERS data, there have been 4,202 cases recorded of fetal deaths following COVID-19 vaccines for the past 18 months since these vaccines were issued EUAs. (Source.)

By way of contrast, performing the exact same search in VAERS for the previous 30 years (360 months) there were only 2,239 fetal deaths recorded following all FDA-approved vaccines during those 30+ years. (Source.)

That’s a 3,653% increase in dead babies following COVID-19 vaccines, compared to deaths of pre-born children following vaccines for the previous 30+ years.

COURT ORDERED RELEASE OF PFIZER DOCUMENT REVEALS 82% – 97% OF VACCINATED PREGNANT WOMEN LOST THEIR BABIES

by Anne Reed

Operation Rescue

A recently released confidential document reveals that a startling majority of in utero babies died after pregnant women were injected with the Pfizer vaccine.

Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT) requested documents related to vaccine licensing via a Freedom of Information Act Request, then sued the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In early January 2022, a federal judge ordered the FDA incrementally release the documents it claimed would take decades to process. PHMPT has posted Pfizer’s confidential documents as they have become available.

In the most recent release, on May 2, 2022, a document titled ‘reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf’ disclosed on page 12 that by February 8, 2021, 270 women had received the mRNA injection during pregnancy. But 238 cases were apparently not followed (“no outcome provided”). And, therefore, the pregnancy outcomes for those women are unknown.

The mere fact that 88% of the pregnant women injected were not followed throughout their pregnancies is deeply concerning since 124 of the 270 pregnant women had some type of adverse reaction (49 nonserious, 75 serious) according to page 12 of the same document.

Among those 34 pregnancies that are known, the report indicates that 28 babies died either in utero or upon birth. Only one outcome was reported as normal, and the remaining five were reported as “pending.”

In analyzing Pfizer’s own data, it is clear that 82% – 97% of the documented pregnancy outcomes resulted in death. (The 15-point variation is dependent on the final outcome of those in the “outcome pending” category.)

“This report confirms information we released last year,” said Operation Rescue president Troy Newman. “We look forward to seeing some kind of accountability put in place for those responsible for hiding this crucial data from the public.”

125,"""The MS-13 Threat

A National Assessment

01/14/08



They perpetrate violence—from assaults to homicides, using firearms, machetes, or blunt objects—to intimidate rival gangs, law enforcement, and the general public. They often target middle and high school students for recruitment. And they form tenuous alliances...and sometimes vicious rivalries...with other criminal groups, depending on their needs at the time.

Who are they? Members of Mara Salvatrucha, better known as MS-13, who are mostly Salvadoran nationals or first generation Salvadoran-Americans, but also Hondurans, Guatemalans, Mexicans, and other Central and South American immigrants. And according to our recent national threat assessment of this growing, mobile street gang, they could be operating in your community...now or in the near future.

Based on information from our own investigations, from our state and local law enforcement partners, and from community organizations, we’ve concluded that while the threat posed by MS-13 to the U.S. as a whole is at the “medium” level, membership in parts of the country is so concentrated that we’ve labeled the threat level there “high.”

Here are some other highlights from our threat assessment:

MS-13 operates in at least 42 states and the District of Columbia and has about 6,000-10,000 members nationwide. Currently, the threat is highest in the western and northeastern parts of the country, which coincides with elevated Salvadoran immigrant populations in those areas. In the southeast and central regions, the current threat is moderate to low, but recently, we’ve seen an influx of MS-13 members into the southeast, causing an increase in violent crimes there.

MS-13 members engage in a wide range of criminal activity, including drug distribution, murder, rape, prostitution, robbery, home invasions, immigration offenses, kidnapping, carjackings/auto thefts, and vandalism. Most of these crimes, you’ll notice, have one thing in common—they are exceedingly violent. And while most of the violence is directed toward other MS-13 members or rival street gangs, innocent citizens often get caught in the crossfire.

MS-13 is expanding its membership at a “moderate” rate through recruitment and migration. Some MS-13 members move to get jobs or to be near family members—currently, the southeast and the northeast are seeing the largest increases in membership. MS-13 often recruits new members by glorifying the gang lifestyle (often on the Internet, complete with pictures and videos) and by absorbing smaller gangs.

Speaking of employment, MS-13 members typically work for legitimate businesses by presenting false documentation. They primarily pick employers that don’t scrutinize employment documents, especially in the construction, restaurant, delivery service, and landscaping industries.

Right now, MS-13 has no official national leadership structure. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles, but when members migrated eastward, they began forming cliques that for the most part operated independently. These cliques, though, often maintain regular contact with members in other regions to coordinate recruitment/criminal activities and to prevent conflicts. We do believe that Los Angeles gang members have an elevated status among their MS-13 counterparts across the country, a system of respect that could potentially evolve into a more organized national leadership structure.

One final word about MS-13: the FBI, through its MS-13 National Joint Task Force and field investigations, remains committed to working with our local, state, national, and international partners to disrupt and dismantle this violent gang.

Note: the assessment is law enforcement sensitive and is not publicly available.""",1

of Federal Regulations

Chapter II. Estimates of the Total Annual Costs and Benefits

of Federal Regulatory Programs

1. Overview

This chapter discusses the total annual costs and benefits of existing Federal regulatory programs called for by Section 645(a)(1). Before doing so, however, it is important to place the subject in perspective.

First, when we speak of the costs or benefits of ""regulations,"" we are in, reality, speaking of the costs and benefits of legislation as well as regulation, for it is usually impossible, and often not productive, to try to allocate costs and benefits between the authorizing statute and its implementing or interpreting regulations.

Second, we need to keep in mind the discussion in Chapter I on best practices for estimating costs and benefits and the limitations on valid and reliable quantitative measures.

Third, it is important to ask: What public policy purposes do aggregate estimates serve if the ultimate goal is to develop the information necessary to make decisions about specific regulatory programs or program elements? And, in particular: In what ways can these estimates help support the recommendations to reform the regulatory system required of the Director by Section 645 (a)(4)? Clearly, knowing the costs and benefits of individual proposals for regulatory actions and their alternatives, including the alternative of no action, enables policy officials to make decisions that improve society's well being. But for reasons discussed below, knowing the total costs and total benefits of all of the many and diverse regulations that the Federal government has issued provides little specific guidance for decisions on reforming regulatory programs.

For example, four possible outcomes can result from totaling up the costs and benefits of all existing Federal regulations:

High costs and high benefits.

High costs and low benefits.

Low costs and high benefits.

Low costs and low benefits.

Given the intensity of the debate over regulatory reform, categories (3) and (4) are not likely outcomes of careful and fair accounting. A priori, it is not clear which of the remaining two categories is most likely. But does it matter? In each case, the policy guidance would be the same. Real economic improvement comes from expanding those significant regulatory programs that provide benefits that are greater than costs and contracting those programs that provide benefits that are less than costs. The substance is in the details, not in the total.

The implication of this discussion is that an excessive amount of resources should not be devoted to estimating the total costs and benefits of all Federal regulations. To the extent that the costs and benefits of specific regulatory programs can easily be combined, some indication of the importance of regulatory reform can be inferred by the magnitude of these estimates, but knowing the exact amounts of total costs and benefits, even if that were possible, adds little of value.

This proposition is important because it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the actual total costs and benefits of all existing Federal regulations with any degree of precision. There are at least two types of intractable problems that make this so.

The Baseline Problem

In order to estimate the impact of regulations on society and the economy, one has to determine the counterfactual -- that is, how things would have been if the regulation had not been issued. In other words, what is the baseline against which costs and benefits should be measured? With respect to estimating total costs and benefits of all Federal regulations, the baseline problem has several dimensions.

First, it is impossible to determine the true counterfactual, since it never happened. What would have happened in the absence of regulation can only be an educated guess. Furthermore, the greater the hypothesized difference between reality and the counterfactual, the more problematic the exercise. For example, some estimates of the total cost of regulation include the cost of compliance with our tax system. But to twist a phrase, one can no more easily imagine a world without taxes than one can imagine a world without death. It is also difficult to imagine a world without health, safety, and environmental regulation. Could a civil society even exist without regulation? In other words, what do we use as the baseline for a world without any regulation?

Second, even disregarding the problem of modeling large changes, there are significant difficulties in determining the counterfactual for individual regulations that one could begin to aggregate. One can survey firms and other regulated entities on their expected compliance costs either ex ante, before the regulation is implemented, or ex post, after the regulation has gone into effect. For both types of studies, the problem of potential bias must be kept in mind. It is often alleged that strategic behavior may color both regulators' and the regulated's estimates of the cost of regulation (Hahn and Hird 1991, Hopkins 1991, and Hahn 1996). Agencies are generally advocates of their programs and businesses generally are not in favor of regulation. In the ordinary course, therefore, the best studies are ex post studies done by individuals who do not have vested interests, but do have reputations as objective analysts to uphold.

Often only ex ante cost estimates are available, but even if firms' or agencies' estimates are unbiased at the time, technological change or ""learning-by-doing"" may result in those estimates overstating compliance costs (Hahn and Hird 1991 and Hahn 1996). In fact, there is much evidence that competition among regulated firms often reduces expected compliance costs once real time and effort is directed at the problem (Office of Technology Assessment 1995).

While ex post studies are likely to be more accurate than ex ante studies because firms should by then have had experience with actual regulatory compliance costs, ex post cost estimates have their own problems. Properly done they are likely to be resource and time intensive. Firms do not usually keep their cost accounting estimates according to what regulations are driving them. Thus, when surveyed, firms have to reconstruct causality. A recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report details the difficulties the GAO had in trying to determine the total cost of Federal regulation by surveying a sample of firms. The firms reported great difficulty in estimating their own costs of compliance because they could not easily separate Federal from State and local regulation and because they did not keep records on incremental costs of regulation (See GAO 1996, pp. 49-51). Some studies have attempted to address this problem reasonably successfully by comparing the results of different degrees of regulation in different localities or time periods.

Moreover, virtually all of the studies of the costs of regulation produced to date are measuring the expenditures of firms required (ex ante or ex post) by regulation, whereas the cost to society of regulation should be measured by the change in consumer and producer surplus associated with the regulation and with any price and/or income changes that may result (Cropper and Oates 1992). At one extreme, ignoring the consumer surplus loss produced by a ban understates costs to society because although no compliance expenditures are required, consumers can no longer buy the product. At the other extreme, calculating compliance expenditures based on pre-regulation output overstates costs because if the firm raises prices to cover compliance costs, consumers will shift to other products, which reduces their welfare losses (Cropper and Oats 1992, p. 722).

A third problem relates to the economy and the appropriateness of the baseline for the purpose for which it is expected to be used. If the objective is to reduce the burden of existing regulation, even ex post evaluation surveys may be inadequate for they would reflect the cost of gearing up to comply, not the cost saving of no longer having to comply with a given regulatory program. While the former is relevant for deciding whether to regulate, the latter would be the relevant concept if one is considering reducing regulation. There is also the dynamic nature of the economy, whereby technological advances over time are likely to reduce the start-up cost of compliance the firm originally faced. In addition, sunk costs, such as specialized capital costs and the cost of changing procedures already in place, make the cost savings from eliminating regulation less than the cost of complying with those regulations. Very few studies exist, especially for health, safety and environmental regulation, that attempt to determine the cost savings that would result from reducing or eliminating existing regulation.

It is important to note that this dynamic nature of the economy may affect the estimation of benefits as well as costs. Technological improvements could reduce predicted benefits. For example, medical progress can reduce the future benefits estimated for health, safety and environmental regulations, just as productivity improvements in manufacturing reduces the costs of compliance of some regulations. New drugs or medical procedures can reduce the benefits of regulations aimed at reducing exposure to certain harmful agents such as an infectious disease or even sunlight. Regulations aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of consumer products or buildings may see their expected benefits reduced by new technology that reduces the cost of producing energy. Furthermore, productivity improvements lead directly to higher incomes, which lead people to demand better health and more safety. Business responds to these demands by providing safer products and workplaces, even in the absence of regulation. Individuals with rising incomes may also purchase or donate land to nature conservancies to provide ecological benefits. Yet as on the cost side, the baseline that is used is almost always the status quo, not what is likely to be true in the future.

Fourth, the construction of a baseline may be complicated where, as frequently occurs, there are several causes of the change in behavior attributed to a Federal regulation. State and local regulations may also require some level of compliance. The tort system, voluntary standards organizations, and public pressure also cause firms to provide a certain degree of public protection in the absence of Federal regulation. As GAO points out, determining how much of the costs and benefits of these activities to attribute solely to Federal regulation is a difficult undertaking (GAO 1996). Adding to the complexity, the degree to which these other factors cause firms and other regulated entities to provide safe and healthful products and workplaces and engage in environmentally sound practices changes over time, generally increasing with increasing per capita incomes and knowledge about cause and effect.

Thus, although the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has significantly increased the safety of automobiles, it is not likely that if the agency's regulations were eliminated the automobile companies would discontinue the safety features that had been mandated. Consumers demand safer cars than they used to and automobile companies are concerned about product liability. This same phenomenon exists with the environment, although probably to a lesser extent. Environmentally responsible behavior has become good for the bottom line. One paper company interviewed by GAO said that it would have incurred a substantial amount of its compliance costs even if there were no regulations, simply as good business practices (GAO 1996, p. 51). Over time, this ""rising baseline"" phenomenon reduces the true costs and benefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations. Estimates of the aggregate costs and benefits of regulation that include unadjusted estimates from aging studies are thus likely to be over estimates of the current costs and benefits of those regulations.

The Apples and Oranges Problem

The studies that have attempted to tote up the total costs and benefits of Federal regulations have basically added together a diverse set of individual studies. Unfortunately, these individual studies vary in quality, methodology, and type of regulatory costs included. Thus we have an apples and oranges problem, or, more aptly, an apples, oranges, kiwis, grapefruit, etc., problem.

Part of the problem arises because of the nature of regulation itself. There are over 130,000 pages of regulations in the Code of Federal Regulation, with about 60 federal agencies issuing regulations at the rate of about 4,000 per year. For our purposes, a ""regulation"" or ""rule"" means an agency statement of general applicability and future effect, which the agency intends to have the force and effect of law, that is designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice of an agency. Clearly, ""regulation"" encompasses a lot of territory. The Hopkins series of studies (1991,1992, 1995,1996), which are the latest attempts to aggregate the costs of all regulations for which estimates are available and which we discuss in detail later, include five major categories of regulation:

Environmental. As the EPA points out, the true social cost of regulations aimed at improving the quality of the environment are represented by the total value that society places on the goods and services foregone as a result of resources being diverted to environmental protection. (Cost of a Clean Environment, pp. 1-2 to 1-3.) These costs include the direct compliance costs of the capital equipment and labor needed to meet the standard, as well as the more indirect consumer and producer surplus losses that result from lost or delayed consumption and production opportunities resulting from the higher prices and reduced output needed to pay for the direct compliance costs. In the case of a product ban or prohibitive compliance costs, almost all of the costs represent consumer and producer surplus losses. Most of the cost estimates used in this report do not include consumer and producer surplus losses because it is difficult to estimate the demand and supply curves needed to do this type of analysis.

Further indirect effects on productivity and efficiency result from these price and output changes as they filter through other sectors of the economy. According to EPA in the Cost of Clean report, recent research indicates that compliance cost estimates may understate substantially the true long-term costs of pollution control (p. 1-3). The estimates used in this report do not include these indirect and general equilibrium effects.

The benefits of environmental protection are represented by the value that society places on improved health, recreational opportunities, quality of life, visibility, preservation of ecosystems, biodiversity, and other attributes of protecting or enhancing our environment. As discussed in chapter I, the value is best measured by society's willingness-to-pay for these attributes. Because most types of improvements in environmental quality are not traded in markets, benefits must be estimated by indirect means using sophisticated statistical techniques that generally make benefit estimation more problematic than cost estimation.

Although the EPA issues the great majority of environmental regulations, DOI, DOT, and the DOE, among others, also issue rules aimed at improving the environment.

Other Social. This category of regulation includes rules designed to advance the health and safety of consumers and workers, as well as regulations aimed at promoting social goals such as equal opportunity, equal access to facilities, and protection from fraud and deception. They are often lumped together with environmental regulation in the category of ""Social Regulation."" Social regulation is mainly concerned with controlling the harmful or unintended consequences of market transactions, such as air pollution, occupationally induced illness, or automobile accidents. These consequences are commonly called ""negative externalities"" and regulation designed to deal with them attempts to ""internalize"" the externalities. This can be done by regulating the amount of the externality, e.g., banning a pollutant or limiting it to a ""safe"" level, or by regulating how a product is produced or used. Social regulation may also require the disclosure of information about a product, service or manufacturing process where inadequate or asymmetric information may place consumers, citizens or workers at a disadvantage. The techniques and methodological concerns involved in the estimation of the social costs and benefits generated by these rules is similar to those involved in the estimation of costs and benefits of environmental regulation discussed above.

Economic. Economic regulation is so-called because it directly restricts firms' primary economic activities, e.g., its pricing and output decisions. It may also limit the entry or exit of firms into or out of certain specific types of businesses. The regulations are usually applied on an industry basis such as agriculture, trucking, or communications. In the United States, this type of regulation at the Federal level has often been administered by what are referred to as ""independent"" commissions, e.g., the FCC, ICC or FERC, whose members are appointed but not removable without good cause by the President. The economic loss caused by this type of regulation results from the higher prices and inefficient operations that often result when competition is prevented from developing.

The costs of such regulation are usually measured by modeling or comparing specific regulated sectors with less regulated sectors, estimating the consumer and producer surplus losses that result from higher prices and lack of service, and estimating the excess costs that may result from the lack of competition. In contrast to social regulatory cost estimates, these estimates are mainly indirect costs.

Economic regulation may produce social benefits when natural monopolies are regulated to simulate competition. Although Hahn and Hird (1991) argue that the dollar amount of such efficiency benefits are small in a dynamic and technologically vibrant economy, this judgement is an educated guess based on a reading of recent history, rather than the result of an empirical study. It appears to be based largely on the widely accepted view that the U.S. economy has become more competitive over time, leaving little scope for benefits from eliminating monopoly, and on the observation that much of the motivation for economic regulation is to enhance one group at the expense of another. As noted above, such transfers are not generally considered social costs or benefits. But even though monopoly power may not be long lasting in a dynamic U.S. economy, it is not nonexistent at a given point in time.

Moreover, while Hahn and Hird (1991) define economic regulation as including only regulation of entry, output, and prices, in practice they appear to lump all Federal regulation of banking and other financial institutions, as well as consumer protection regulation through mandated disclosure requirements, into the ""economic regulation"" category in their cost estimates. In our view, chartering , branching, interest rate, and activity regulation are the only major categories of banking regulation that conform to the definition of economic regulation used here. The other categories are ""safety-and- soundness"" regulation and ""consumer information and protection"" regulation, both of which fit more logically into the ""other social regulations"" category used in this study (White 1991, pp. 32-33). This definitional issue is important because the type and magnitude of benefits associated with the different categories of banking regulation differ greatly. In particular, while costs may exceed benefits for some types of economic (entry, output, and prices) regulation, safety-and-soundness regulation is essential to a well-functioning financial system and thus fully justifies the cost (White 1991), and the consumer protection regulation applicable to banking is similar to consumer protection information for other industries where there is general agreement that the benefits exceed the costs.

Transfer. As discussed in chapter I, transfers are payments from one group in society to another and therefore are not real costs to society as a whole. One person's loss is another person's gain. Examples of transfers include payments to Social Security recipients from taxpayers and the higher profits that farmers receive as a result of the higher prices consumers must pay for farm products limited by production quotas. Nevertheless, Hopkins (1991) includes transfer costs in the total cost of regulations. He does place them in a separate category and points out that they are different from the real social costs that result from economic efficiency losses. Also as discussed in Chapter I, OMB's guidance states that transfers should not be added to the cost and benefit totals included in regulatory assessments but should be discussed and noted for policy makers.

Process. Process costs, according to Hopkins, are the administrative or paperwork costs of filling out government forms such as income tax, immigration, social security, procurement etc. Although there are benefits to the services that these government programs provide and some minimum amount of process cost is necessary to deliver these services, it makes little sense to try to place a separate value on administration. Rather, process costs should be viewed as a ""cost of doing business"" that should be minimized for a given level or quality of service.

Adding these various categories together, as Hopkins and others have done, does two things. It produces large numbers and it creates confusion. It produces large numbers by including ""costs"" that are not normally considered as part of the regulatory reform debate. For example, costs such as the burden of filling out income tax forms or doing the paperwork needed to get visas, passports, small business loans, and veterans benefits are not what one usually thinks about when worrying about the cost of regulation. Nor do we usually think that the income gained by farmers from price support programs or the increased sales by domestic businesses as a result of trade protection are costs of regulation. Congress did not seek oversight of these types of costs when, in the last Congress, it debated legislative proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform, such as S. 343 and H.R. 9, or when it passed the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 or the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.

Adding these categories of regulation together with health, safety and environmental regulation also creates confusion if the ultimate goal is to make recommendations for regulatory reform because the appropriate policies to reduce any adverse effects from these programs are very different. To reduce price supports, modify international trade protectionism, and minimize non-cost-effective health, safety, and environmental regulation would take very different paths. It may make it appreciably more difficult. Lumping them together does not enlighten the search for appropriate reforms.

In sum, adding up the costs and benefits of the various regulatory programs may give us a rough estimate of the magnitude of the impact of regulatory activities on the economy and make it clear that regulation plays an important role in our economy. We do not disagree that this is important information to have. Indeed, we can use the total cost figures to begin to track the extent of this activity relative to other aggregate data. For example, our calculations indicate that regulatory costs are about 4 percent (3.7%) of GDP in 1997. We have also looked at 1988, and found that regulatory costs were then roughly the same percentage. From this comparison, we can say that there has been no material growth in the cost of regulation relative to the size of the economy in the last decade.

However, these data provide little useful information about what to do next. If what is intended is to make regulation more efficient, one needs to estimate the incremental costs and benefits of individual regulations, or specific provisions of individual regulations, on a case-by-case basis. If what is intended is to reduce the burden of existing, health, safety and environmental regulation, one needs to estimate how firms would react to the removal of requirements, not how they acted when the requirements were originally imposed. If what is intended is to improve the cost-effectiveness of new regulations, one needs to know what factors are preventing future regulations from being more cost-effective. But none of this information is found in the aggregate estimates of the costs and benefits of regulation done to date.

2. Our Estimates of the Costs and Benefits of Existing Regulations

To meet the requirements of Section 645(a)(1), we surveyed the existing literature on the total costs and benefits of regulation, supplementing it with information we have obtained from reviewing regulatory impact analyses over the last ten years under Executive Orders 12291 and 12866. Our review of the literature revealed only one comprehensive study that attempted to estimate the total costs and benefits of all Federal regulations (Hahn and Hird 1991). Hahn and Hird's estimates were peer reviewed and published in one of the top economics/ legal journals specializing in regulatory issues, the Yale Journal on Regulation. In addition, EPA issued a report to Congress at about the same time known as the Cost of Clean report (EPA 1990). The Cost of Clean report is recognized as the most thorough and careful attempt to estimate the compliance cost of environmental regulation published to date.

The Hahn and Hird study compiled cost and benefit estimates from over 25 studies published mostly by academics in peer reviewed journals, e.g.,. Hufbauer (1986) for international trade, Wenders (1987) for telecommunications, Gardner (1987) for agricultural price supports, Morrison and Winston (1986 and 1989) for airlines, Crandall (1986) for highway safety, and Crandall (1988), Denison, (1979), and Viscusi (1983) for Occupational Safety and Health. It should be noted that although all of these studies are generally recognized as the best available, they are not without shortcomings. For example, the Crandall (1988) and Denison (1979) studies relied upon for the cost of OSHA regulations used survey data that included expenditures that firms would have made on safety in the absence of OSHA regulation.

The Cost of Clean report's estimates of costs are based on annual survey data from the Department of Commerce's ""Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures"" (PACE) reports, regulatory impact analyses of major EPA regulations, and special analyses by EPA program offices or contractors. The PACE report surveys, which were conducted through 1994, but discontinued thereafter, cannot be used without careful adjustments because they contain pollution control expenditures that are not Federally mandated. EPA is continuing its efforts to review the costs and benefits of certain of its regulatory programs. It has completed reports on drinking water (EPA 1993) and surface water (EPA 1995) and is presently working on a report required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 on the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act, which it plans to submit to Congress in October of 1997. A draft of this report presents estimates that appear to be at variance with some of the numbers we report below (EPA 1997).

In addition, we used information about the costs and benefits of major regulations reviewed by OMB under Executive Orders 12291 and 12866. (We include the rules published in 1987 and 1988 to allow for a lag between publication of the rule and the expenditure of funds for compliance and realization of benefits.) The rules included are generally all final rules with annual costs of $100 million or more issued by Executive Branch agencies, which we believe capture at least 90 percent of the costs added by all rules. The cost estimates themselves are agency estimates that have gone through OMB review and the Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment by the public.

Total Cost

Using the estimates for Federally mandated regulatory costs from the Cost of Clean report (1990, Table 8-9D) for environmental regulation and Hahn and Hird's estimates for other social regulation for a 1988 base, we added the cost of all major regulations reviewed by OMB under Executive Orders 12291 and 12866 and issued by the agencies between 1987 and 1996. Table 1 shows our calculations for the costs of social regulations.

Table 1: Estimates of the Annual Cost of Social Regulation for 1997

(Billions of 1996 dollars)

Environmental Other Social Total Social 1988 Baseline

(EPA, Hahn and Hird) 101 35 136 Cost of rules 1987-96

( OMB) 43 19 62 Total for 1997 144 54 198

While our estimates do not include the costs of regulations with costs below $100 million nor regulations from independent agencies such as the CSPC or NRC, and there is a possibility that agencies understate the costs of proposed rules (Hopkins, 1992, p. 13), we believe that, if anything, the estimates overstate actual direct costs because of the rising baseline phenomenon discussed above. For example, as a sensitivity analysis, it does not seem implausible that, for environmental and other social regulations over ten years old, no more than half of compliance costs would likely be saved if these Federal regulations magically disappeared over night. The automobile companies are not likely to make their cars less safe or less fuel efficient. Similarly, the great majority of firms are not likely to stop controlling asbestos and cotton dust fibers or lead dust and benzene emissions in the workplace if these regulations were abolished. Nor would the judicial tort system likely tolerate increased levels of harmful pollution or harmful products. If this scenario is correct, then the cost of social regulation in 1997 would fall to $130 billion (136/2 + 62 = 130), or $93 billion for environmental regulations and $37 billion for other social regulation.

To the cost estimates for environmental and other social regulation, we must add the costs of the other types of regulation, i.e., economic and process regulation. We use the Hahn and Hird estimate for the efficiency cost of economic regulation for 1988. Because the great majority of these regulations are issued by independent regulatory agencies (e .g., the FCC, the ITC, and the FDIC) that were not required under Executive Orders 12291 or 12866 to submit information on benefits and costs of regulations to OMB, we did not have our own data to update the 1988 baseline. Instead, we relied on a study by Hopkins (1992) who derived an estimate of $81 billion for the efficiency costs of economic regulation for 1997.

Hopkins (1992) made several additions to Hahn and Hird to update economic regulation costs to 1997: $10 billion for surface transportation costs, $5 billion for the Jones Act, and $5 billion for banking regulations (p. 27). However, since Hopkins made his estimates in 1992, there have been several developments resulting in further deregulation, especially in banking -- with the passage of the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 and the recent actions taken by the four Federal bank regulatory agencies to reduce regulatory burdens -- and in telecommunications -- where the FCC has also taken steps to increase competition and implement the Telecommunications Act of 1996. To take into account the recent deregulation in financial services and telecommunications, we reduced the Hopkins' estimate by $10 billion.

We do not include Hopkins' estimate of the transfer costs of economic regulation, because, as noted above, we do not believe that transfers are costs that should be included in total cost of regulation estimates. However, if one insists on adding transfer costs using the Hopkins' methodology, the total would increase by about $140 billion because he assumes transfer costs are about twice efficiency costs. However, by definition, this transfer amount must also be added to total benefits .

We also do not include most of ",1
147,"""When it comes to actions taken to address the Covid-19 threat, hindsight is still very much underway. For your consideration: a story and outcome you probably aren't hearing much about anywhere else. It takes place in the heart of Amish country.

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: thousands of families lead lives largely separate from modern America.

The Amish are a Christian group that emphasizes the virtuous over the superficial. They don’t usually drive, use electricity, or have TVs. And during the Covid-19 outbreak, they became subjects in a massive social and medical experiment.

Sharyl: So, it's safe to say there was a whole different approach here in this community when coronavirus broke out than many other places?

Calvin Lapp: Absolutely.

Calvin Lapp is Amish Mennonite.

Lapp: There’s three things the Amish don't like. And that's government— they won't get involved in the government, they don't like the public education system— they won't send their children to education, and they also don't like the health system. They rip us off. Those are three things that we feel like we're fighting against all the time. Well, those three things are all part of what Covid is.

After a short shutdown last year, the Amish chose a unique path that led to Covid-19 tearing through at warp speed. It began with an important religious holiday in May.

Lapp: When they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup. So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus. The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus.

Lapp says they weren’t denying coronavirus, they were facing it head on.

Lapp: It’s a worse thing to quit working than dying. Working is more important than dying. But to shut down and say that we can't go to church, we can't get together with family, we can't see our old people in the hospital, we got to quit working? It's going completely against everything that we believe. You're changing our culture completely to try to act like they wanted us to act the last year, and we're not going to do it.

Steve Nolt is a scholar on Amish and Mennonite culture, and Mennonite himself. He’s studying Amish news publications to analyze community-wide trends.

Sharyl: So, are you saying, as of about May of 2020, things kind of went back to normal in the Amish community?

Steve Nolt: For the most part, yeah, by the middle of May, it's sort of like back to a typical behavior again.

That also meant avoiding hospitals.

Nolt: I know of some cases in which Amish people refused to go to the hospital, even when they were very sick because if they went there, they wouldn't be able to have visitors. And it was more important to be sick, even very sick at home and have the ability to have some people around you than to go to the hospital and be isolated.

Then, last March, remarkable news. The Lancaster County Amish were reported to be the first community to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning a large part of a population had been infected with Covid-19 and became immune.

Some outsiders are skeptical, and solid proof is hard to come by.

Nolt: Even those who believed that they had Covid tended not to get tested. Their approach tended to be, “I'm sick. I know I'm sick. I don't have to have someone else telling me I'm sick.” Or a concern that if they got a positive test, they would then be asked to really dramatically limit what they were doing in a way that might be uncomfortable for them. So, we don't have that testing number.

Lapp: We didn't want the numbers to go up, because then they would shut things more. What's the advantage of getting a test?

One thing’s clear: there's no evidence of any more deaths among the Amish than in places that shut down tight— some claim there were fewer here. That’s without masking, staying at home, or another important measure.

Sharyl: Did most of the community, at least the adults, get the Covid-19 vaccine?

Nolt: Again, we don't have data on that, but I think it's pretty clear that in percentage terms, relatively few did.

Lapp: Oh, we're glad all the English people got their Covid vaccines. That's great. Because now we don't have to wear a mask, we can do what we want. So good for you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Us? No, we're not getting vaccines. Of course not. We all got the Covid, so why would you get a vaccine?

By staying open, the Amish here have one tangible 2020 accomplishment few others can claim.

Lapp: We have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running. We made more money in the last year than we ever did. It was our best year ever.

Did the Amish really find a magic formula? They say yes. And they don’t care who doubts it.

Lapp: Yeah, all the Amish know we got herd immunity. Of course we got herd immunity! The whole church gets coronavirus. We know we got coronavirus. We think we’re smarter than everybody. We shouldn’t be bragging, but we think we did the right thing.

Matthew had recently taken a new position in a private practice in Charlotte, and felt that the move was a mistake, calling it 'career suicide.' Betsy suggested he seek help and take antidepressants, but Matthew was afraid of losing his medical license and declined. Lynette Eddy, a social worker, lost her husband to suicide in 2010. Betsy and Lynette both had to find ways to heal and rebuild their lives after the self-inflicted death of their husbands. bereaved survivors of suicide experience guilt and questions, but it is not solely the choice of the person who died. They often blame themselves and ask why it happened, what they missed, and what they could have done differently. Mental health issues are excruciatingly difficult, and it is not possible to force someone to seek help. Secrecy often develops, leading to family dysfunction and withdrawal from social networks and friends, which can make mourning and recovery more difficult. Being able to talk openly about the death and the loved one is actually very helpful. Getting professional help or joining a support group can be valuable for people bereaved by suicide. Betsy and Lynette draw upon their spirituality for comfort and strength. Spirituality and mindfulness-based approaches do not resonate with everyone, but any activity demanding close attention can bring that quality to the fore. Some people emerge changed for the better after losing a loved one to suicide, which is often called “posttraumatic growth”.",1

227,"Brain cells can harbor and spread HIV virus to the body, but the brain is not a critical reservoir for HIV in cure strategies. Contrary to previous beliefs, astrocytes cannot harbor or spread HIV, and HIV did not move from the brain to peripheral organs even when suppressed by cART. A study on this topic was not funded by the National Institutes of Health. Without treatment, HIV destroys CD4+ T cells, reducing the body’s ability to mount an immune response, which is eventually lethal. While cART does not address HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, it remains an effective treatment to reduce the mortality rate of those with the virus. Researchers remain uncertain if HIV-infected brain cells can release the virus to other tissues for reinfection, but Lena Al-Harthi, Ph.D., and her team at Rush University Medical Center showed that transplanted HIV-infected astrocytes could spread the virus to CD4+ T cells in the brain, which migrate out and infect peripheral organs. Targeting and eliminating such reservoirs can help eradicate HIV from the body, according to Dr. Al-Harthi. Given the virus's impact on brain and other tissue-based reservoirs, a better understanding of HIV is necessary to help patients worldwide.

240,"""“The mRNA Covid vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market,” vaccine researcher and author Alex Berenson told Fox News host Tucker Carlson Tuesday night.

The former journalist for the New York Times said the vaccines should be recalled because they’ve proven “a dangerous and ineffective product at this point.”

“We’re at a very dangerous moment, Tucker, and I’m not exaggerating. I think this is probably the most important appearance I’ve had with you in the last two years,” the “Pandemia” author began.

The stat-driven vaccine investigator, who was removed by Twitter last year, added that data he’s seen suggests the vaccines are driving infection rates.

“It is completely clear now that the vaccines don’t really work at all against omicron,” Berenson said. “In these highly-vaccinated and highly boosted countries, rates of infection are incredibly high and rates of serious disease and death are also rising.”

“I have not said this to you before because I’m pretty careful and I’m pretty careful with the data,” Berenson told Tucker, “but these vaccines, these mRNA vaccines, the mRNA COVID vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market now.”

“No one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double boosted. They are a dangerous and ineffective product at this point against omicron.”

Asked what he meant by “dangerous,” Berenson referred to adverse reactions such as the heart condition myocarditis, which depending on the dose could affect teens and college-aged males.

“There’s danger, and the danger is dose-related. That’s a general rule in medicine. the dose makes the poison and giving people more mRNA that’s gonna make them produce spike protein that doesn’t match the current spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is useless and is likely to wrong-foot their immune systems.”

Berenson says the vaccines and subsequent boosters induce a vicious cycle that weaken immune systems and help spread infection, thereby keeping emergency rooms full in highly-vaccinated areas.

Berenson added a more effective solution needs to be found soon before a more virulent strain comes along.

“We’re lucky right now because omicron is not as dangerous Delta it appears overall,” he said.

“If another variant comes and we’re wrong-footed like this and it’s more virulent I don’t know what’s going to happen but we should be trying to avoid that not trying to buy a couple months so Tony Fauci can feel better.”

 CANCER HOAX 
 Needle biopsies, for example. 
 People need to understand that a tumour is there to save your life. When your body is full with poison, toxaemic and acidosis and you are basically going to die of that poison - your body builds a bag and collects all the poison from your body into this bag, which they call a tumour. So the body did all the work. And now they come and they say ""We need to do a needle biopsy."" and pinch into this highly toxic tumour; which of course now explodes and pours all the poison into the body. And then they say ""You have a very fast growing, very aggressive form of cancer."". They GAVE it to you. They created it. 
 And most cancers disappear on their own anyway, because about 7-10 times, everybody has cancer in their lifetime. If you don't become unlucky enough to fall into the hands of a medical professional and get a test done and they tell you that you have something bad going on; and the very next day, can start murdering you with chemotherapy, which is based on mustard gas. Mustard gas is forbidden after the Geneva Convention as a war chemical; they put it into your bloodstream and radiate you to death. Or cut you surgically - which always spreads the cancer."" - Dr. Leonard Coldwell 
 ""Cancer is not an illness - cancer is a symptom. These cancerous growths, the cell growths, whatever it might be, that we don't want in our body, is a symptom; it is not the cancer. So cutting the symptom out does not resolve your problem, at all. And that's why it reappears. Or why they kill the entire body with chemotherapy for two years. Now, anything shrinks. Your organs shrink, the brain shrinks - and the tumour shrinks. Because they dehydrate the body. So now, at the same rate at your organs are shrinking, your tumour is shrinking. Now they say ""It's working. The tumour is shrinking."". It's one of the biggest frauds ever."" - Dr. Leonard Coldwell

262,"""FEMA “Smart” Guillotines Placed in FEMA Internment Camps (video)

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.

If all information is accurate, the Deep State, using FEMA as its agent of evil, is expediting plans to herd humans into internment camps. The acquisition of smart guillotines is a portent of the Deep State’s hatred of America, the American people, and of the document—the Constitution—our forefathers authored to protect us from the wicked machinations of the very government we elected into office.

“All states have them, but Texas got the majority right now,” our source said.

The 500 units were sent to FEMA camps near Austin, a New World Orderin Waco, and a FEMA internment camp disguised as a water treatment facility in Carrolton.

“FEMA’s main focus is on Texas. All eyes on Texas. If there’s going to be a public insurrection, they know the battle lines will be dawn in Texas. They know the patriot community is thick in Texas. That’s why Texas is receiving more of these smart guillotines than any other state. FEMA’s first strike will occur in Texas,” our source said.

The Andrews AFB shipment—over 500 smart guillotines–was distributed by rail to FEMA zone six, an area encompassing Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Belgrade, and Arkansas, primarily “red” states likely to resist a declaration of Martial Law or a military incursion against the American people.

After Obama left office, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security kept the smart guillotine project alive, using slush funds and black project money to fund three thousand of the villainous devices, each of which reportedly cost seventeen million dollars. FEMA ordered them from the Chinese, our source added, because the agency “felt guilty” about using Made-in-America products to execute Americans. In addition, the Chinese versions are less costly.

“The Deep State, and by association FEMA, recognized that some of its own people’s heads might accidentally wind up on the chopping block. They had to devise a way to stop the blade from lopping off friendly heads. So, when a person is face down waiting for the blade to fall, the computer scans the face and iris. If it matches a friendly face stored in a database, the blade won’t fall, and the person is set free,” our source said.

If a person resists, arm and leg restraints spring forth from recessed compartments, rendering the victim immobile. Moreover, the smart guillotines employ biometric scanning, including facial recognition technology to exonerate persons mistakenly placed on the guillotine for execution.

For example, the headrest has motion sensors and pressure plates that detect the presence of a human neck. No operator is needed; a computer drops and retracts a razor-sharp weighted titanium blade, which, our source said, can sever several hundred heads per sharpening.

The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below. The smart guillotine retains the basic design while adding several scientific advancements.

The guillotine gained popularity during the French Revolution. The device consists of a tall, upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspended.

He said the smart guillotine project was commissioned in 2011, at the request of former president Barrack Hussein Obama, who had hoped during his term toand use the deadly apparatus against patriots and freedom fighters that challenged his one-world government agenda. The guillotine, he added, is the ideal method of execution for instilling fear among the masses.

The technologically advanced guillotines, he said, are being manufactured in Beijing before being flown exclusively to US airbases. Then, the military distributes the guillotines to FEMA camps nationwide.

A United States Air force C-17 cargo plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base loaded with crates of “smart” guillotines, says a White House insider speaking under condition of anonymity.

Title Tennessee Has Just LEGALIZED Government COVID Kidnappings! – The Daily Allegiant""",1
327,"""WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke has long owned up to his drunken driving arrest 20 years ago, describing it in a Houston Chronicle/San Antonio Express-News op-ed piece earlier this week as a “serious mistake for which there is no excuse.”

Although the arrest has been public knowledge, police reports of the September 1998 incident - when the Democratic Senate candidate had just turned 26 - show that it was a more serious threat to public safety than has previously been reported.

State and local police reports obtained by the Chronicle and Express-News show that O’Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called “a high rate of speed” in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile from the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median into oncoming lanes. The witness, who stopped at the scene, later told police that O’Rourke had tried to drive away from the scene.

O'Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. He was arrested at the scene and charged with DWI, but completed a court-approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed.

In a statement Thursday, O’Rourke did not address the witness account of his alleged attempt to flee.

""I drove drunk and was arrested for a DWI in 1998,” O’Rourke said. “As I've publicly discussed over the last 20 years, I made a serious mistake for which there is no excuse.""

That and a separate arrest for jumping a fence at a University of Texas-El Paso facility have long been a matter of record in O’Rourke’s public life, both on the El Paso City Council and in Congress. But the unexplained details of the crash and DWI in Anthony, a suburb about 20 miles north of El Paso that borders New Mexico, could now emerge as a potential attack point in his quest to unseat Texas Republican Ted Cruz.

The Cruz campaign declined to comment Thursday on the police report. Recent polls have shown the two candidates in an ever-tightening race, with O’Rourke enjoying a large fundraising advantage built on small dollar donations. O’Rourke has also disavowed money from political action committees, giving his longshot bid the aura of a grassroots campaign free of special interest influence.

RURAL TEXAS BARNSTORM: Three days on the road with Beto O’Rourke

Neither arrest has factored significantly into O’Rourke’s political career, though both were used against him in his successful 2012 campaign against former El Paso Congressman Silvestre Reyes in a predominantly Hispanic district.

O’Rourke has long characterized the incidents as youthful indiscretions in which he showed “poor judgement.”

To some extent, he has sought to leverage them to advantage. After a recent tour of the Harris County Jail with Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, O’Rourke cited his own scrapes with the law as part of a plea for criminal justice reform.

“Those mistakes did not ultimately define me or stop me from what I wanted to do in my life or how I wanted to contribute to the success of my family and my community,” he wrote in the op-ed piece, which was published Monday.

The law enforcement reports show two elements of the incident that have been overlooked: that there was a crash involved, and that O’Rourke allegedly attempted to flee.

Though no injuries were reported, an ambulance was called to the scene.

A Texas Department of Public Safety report on the incident was based on a motorist’s description of O’Rourke’s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10. The Anthony Police Department and DPS reports differ as to whether O’Rourke was heading east or west on the interstate, but both agree that he struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes.

Police said O’Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist “then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O’Rourke) to stop,” the report says.

The DPS report described O’Rourke as having “glossy” eyes, slurred speech, smelling of liquor, and almost falling to the ground as he got out of his car.

The accident occurred just as O’Rourke, the son of an El Paso County Judge, had celebrated his 26th birthday the night before. He told police he’d had two beers and had been on cold medication. He later told the El Paso Times that he was driving an intoxicated friend home, though no passenger is mentioned in the police reports.

At the time - still seven years before he first ran for city council in 2005 - O’Rourke was starting up an internet and software company in El Paso. Police reports listed his occupation as “salesman.”""",1

The study did not find a difference in risk based on race, but the adverse health effects may be greater for Black women due to their higher usage rates. The study also found that straighteners can increase the risk of hormone-related cancers in women.

351,"""CHICAGO, IL – The American Medical Association (AMA), in a surprising move, has officially rescinded a previous statement against the use of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, giving physicians the okay to return to utilizing the medication at their discretion.

Previously, the AMA had issued a statement in March that was highly critical of HCQ in regards to its use as a proposed treatment by some physicians in the early stages of COVID-19. In addition to discouraging doctors from ordering the medication in bulk for “off-label” use – HCQ is typically used to treat diseases such as malaria – they also claimed that there was no proof that it was effective in treating COVID, and that its use could be harmful in some instances.

However, on page 18 of a recent AMA memo, issued on October 30, (resolution 509, page 3) the organization officially reversed their stance on HCQ, stating that its potential for good currently may supersede the threat of any potential harmful side effects.

So, there we have it. HZQ could not be approved before the election, because President Trump had recommended it.

427,"""On May 2 Real Raw News reported that U.S. Special Forces under White Hat authority had raided a Moderna Covid-19 vaccine repository and destroyed approximately 250,000 vials of the company’s precious clot shots. Additional information has become known, and we can now report that the Special Forces team had confiscated several boxes of vaccines prior to destroying the stockpile.

The product was then shipped to White Hats at U.S. Army Medical Research Command (USAMRDC) for chemical analysis. Fort Deitrick Deputy Commander Col. Andrew C. Kim personally oversaw the tests and on 6 May forwarded the results to the office of Marine Corps General David H. Berger.

A source within the general’s office relayed the findings to RRN.

According to him, 10 of 60 vials contained insecticides, or more specifically moderate concentrations of cypermethrin and resmethrin, synthetic pesticides found commonly in products like Ortho Home Defense. Although neurotoxicity via ingestion by humans is toxic but ‘generally weak’, sufficient quantities or potent concentrations of these products can affect the nervous system in humans.

Moderna’s literature does not list cypermethrin or resmethrin as vaccine ingredients. Nonetheless, Big Pharma has a history of omitting potentially lethal ingredients—what it calls trade secrets—from publicly available pharmacy printouts.

These ingredients—called synthetic pyrethroids—have for decades been used as an insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications as well as in consumer products for domestic purposes. Symptoms of dermal exposure include numbness, tingling, itching, burning sensation, loss of bladder control, incoordination, seizures, and death. Ingestion has reportedly caused similar symptoms as well as brain swelling, cerebral hemorrhaging, and aphasia.

In 1998 the FDA repeatedly fed cypermethrin to laboratory mice; in some cases, the chemical liquified internal organs.

More important, there is no precedent to gauge how the product would affect human physiology when injected into the bloodstream, in any concentration.

Quoting our source: “The scientists at USAMRDC expressed concern not only because the anomalous chemicals were found in the vaccine vials but also because that vaccine stockpile was meant to be injected into the arms of babies and children under five years old. Nowhere, absolutely nowhere, does Moderna say pesticides are present in their vaccine.”

White Hats, our source added, are convinced that all three major pharmaceutical manufacturers—Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson—have secretly stockpiled ‘infant-friendly’ vaccinations in warehouses across the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. The CEOs of these companies– Stéphane Bancel, Albert Bourla, and Joaquin Duato, in that order—have literally begged the FDA for first dibs at putting their vaccine into the arms of American babies. Also, none of the CEOs is an American citizen. Bancel is French, Bourla is Greek (and a veterinarian, not a physician,) and Duato was born in Spain.

“These people are globalists waging a war of eugenics. They are also all members of the Bilderberg Group. We are working to find their stockpiles, but it’s a huge task. These are truly some of the evilest people on the face of the planet,” our source said.

Under Sharubberia Law, subjects are required to worship to the East 43 times per day or face death, and all but the leader are only allowed the one word spoken by the Muslamic Moon God Allahu: “Worship,” which they pronounce “Ne.”

""Queen Elizabeth's corgis"" redirects here. For the 2019 animated film, see The Queen's Corgi

The royal corgis are the Pembroke Welsh Corgi dogs formerly owned by Elizabeth II and her parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Fond of corgis since she was a small child, Elizabeth II owned more than 30 corgis from when she became Queen of the Commonwealth realms in 1952 until her death in 2022.[1][2]

Elizabeth II owned at least one Corgi at any given time between the years 1933–2018.[3]

The royal corgis were globally publicised (such as in the cover photo and feature article of Vanity Fair's Summer 2016 edition[3]). Leaving a lasting legacy after death, they have been depicted and immortalised in various artwork, such as statues, professional photographs, and paintings. For instance, the crown coin commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II depicts the Queen with a corgi.[4]

History [ edit ]

[5] The first three generations from Susan.

The Queen was very fond of corgis since she was a small child,[6] having fallen in love with the corgis owned by the children of the Marquess of Bath.[7] King George VI brought home Dookie in 1933.[8] A photograph from George VI's photo album shows a ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) with Dookie at Balmoral. Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret would feed Dookie by hand from a dish held by a footman.[9] The other early favorite corgi during the same time was Jane.[10]

Elizabeth II's mother, at that time Queen Elizabeth, introduced a disciplined regimen for the dogs; each was to have its own wicker basket, raised above the floor to avoid drafts. Meals were served for each dog in its own dish, the diet approved by veterinary experts with no tidbits from the royal table. A proprietary brand of meat dog biscuits was served in the morning, while the late afternoon meal consisted of dog meal with gravy. Extra biscuits were handed out for celebrations and rewards.[citation needed]

Crackers (24 December 1939, Windsor – November, 1953) was one of the Queen Mother's corgis, and nearly a constant companion; he retired with the Queen Mother to the Castle of Mey in Scotland.[11] In 1944, Elizabeth was given Susan as a gift on her 18th birthday.[12] Susan accompanied Elizabeth on her honeymoon in 1947. The corgis owned by the Queen are descended from Susan.[9][13][14] Rozavel Sue, daughter of Rozavel Lucky Strike, an international champion, was one of the Queen's corgis in the early 1950s.

When Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited Grand Cayman in 1983, government officials gave her black coral sculptures of a corgi and a horse as a gift, both made by Bernard Passman.[15]

Domestic life [ edit ]

Sugar was the nursery pet of Prince Charles and Princess Anne.[16] In 1955, her dogs, Whisky and Sherry, were surprise Christmas gifts from the Queen to the Prince and Princess.[17] Pictured with the royal family, the corgi Sugar made the cover of The Australian Women's Weekly on 10 June 1959.[18] Sugar's twin, Honey, belonged to the Queen Mother; Honey took midday runs with Johnny and Pippin, Princess Margaret's corgis, whilst the Princess lived in Buckingham Palace.[citation needed] Heather was born in 1962 and became one of the Queen's favourites. Heather was the mother of Tiny, Bushy, and Foxy; Foxy gave birth to Brush in 1969.[19]

The corgis enjoyed a privileged life in Buckingham Palace. They resided in a bespoke room devoted to their habitation, known as the Corgi Room, and slept in elevated wicker baskets.[20] The Queen tended to the corgis in her kennel herself. She also chose the sires of litters that were bred in her kennel. The corgis had an extensive menu at the palace which included fresh rabbit and beef, served by a gourmet chef.[20] At Christmas, the Queen made stockings for the pets full of toys and delicacies such as biscuits.[20] In 1999, one of Queen Elizabeth's royal footman was demoted from Buckingham Palace for his ""party trick of pouring booze into the corgis' food and water"" and watching them ""staggering about"" with relish.[21]

In 2007, the Queen was noted to have five corgis, Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly; five cocker spaniels, Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick, and Span; and four ""dorgis"" (dachshund-corgi crossbreeds), Cider, Berry, Vulcan, and Candy.[9] In 2012, Queen Elizabeth II's corgis Monty, Willow, and Holly appeared during the brief James Bond sketch when Daniel Craig arrived at Buckingham Palace for a mission to take the queen to the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Monty, who had previously belonged to the Queen Mother, and one of her ""Dorgis"" died in September 2012.[22] Monty had been named after the horse whisperer and friend of the queen, Monty Roberts.[23] It was reported in July 2015 that the Queen has stopped breeding corgis as she does not wish any to survive her in the event of her death. Monty Roberts had urged Elizabeth to breed more corgis in 2012 but she had told him that she ""didn't want to leave any young dog behind"" and wanted to put an end to the practice.[24]

By April 2018, with the death of Willow, the Queen no longer had any full-bred corgis. Only one dorgi, Candy, was still alive.[1] Candy was joined by another dorgi pup named Fergus and a pure-bred corgi called Muick in 2021.[25] Fergus died from a heart defect at five-months old in the same year.[26] In June 2021, the Queen was gifted a new corgi by her son Prince Andrew, and granddaughters Beatrice and Eugenie.[27]

The dogs have traditionally been buried at the royal residence, Sandringham estate in Norfolk, at which they died.[28] The graveyard was first used by Queen Victoria when her Collie, Noble, died in 1887.[29]

Prince Andrew gave The Queen some corgi puppies in April 2021, after the death of The Duke of Edinburgh.

Victims [ edit ]

On several occasions, the Queen or her staff have been injured by the corgis. In 1954, the palace clock winder, Leonard Hubbard, was bitten by Susan upon entering the nursery at the Royal Lodge, Windsor.[30][31][32] Later in the same year, one of the Queen Mother's corgis bit a policeman on guard duty in London.[33]

In 1968, Peter Doig called for the royal staff to put up a ""Beware of the dog"" sign at Balmoral after one of the corgis bit the postman.[34] In February 1989, it was reported that the royal family had hired an animal psychologist to tame the dogs after they developed a habit of nipping them and the staff.[35] ""And in 1989, the Queen Mother’s dog, Ranger, led a pack of corgis that attacked and killed the Queen’s beloved dorgi, Chipper.""[36] In March 1991, the Queen was bitten after trying to break up a fight between ten or so of her corgis. She had to have three stitches to her left hand. John Collins, the Queen Mother's chauffeur, had to have a tetanus injection after he also tried to intervene.[37] In 2003, Pharos, a tenth-generation offspring of Susan, was put down after being mauled by Princess Anne's English bull terrier, Dottie. Anne arrived at Sandringham to visit her mother for Christmas and the corgis rushed out of the front door as they arrived. It was reported that ""Dottie went for Pharos, savaging the corgi's hind legs and breaking one in three places.""[38]

Influence [ edit ]

The royal corgis are known all across the world and are closely associated with the Queen. The corgis have had numerous items dedicated to them, in particular being the subject of many statues and works of art. Because of the Queen's fondness for the Welsh Corgi, an increased number of corgis were exhibited in the 1954 West Australian Canine Association's Royal Show.[39] Queen Elizabeth II's crown coin KM# 1135, made of copper nickel of size 33 mm, issued during her Golden Jubilee year, shows the Queen with a corgi.[4] Cartoonist Carl Giles included the corgis in every cartoon he drew of the Queen after 1962.[40]

The pets are the subject of an animated comedy film by Belgian studio NWave Pictures, called The Queen's Corgi, which was released in the UK in July 2019.[41]

After a long day of crumbling support, the nomination of Atty. Gen.-designate Zoe Baird has been withdrawn at her request, the White House announced early today, ending her bid to become the first woman to fill the post.

In a statement, President Clinton, faced with the first setback of his Administration, praised Baird’s “decency and integrity” but said that “with sadness, I have accepted her request” to withdraw the nomination.

Baird, in a letter to Clinton, said “the continuing controversy” surrounding her nomination would impede her ability to reinvigorate the Justice Department.

Baird said she was “surprised at the extent of the public reaction” to the controversy surrounding the hiring of two illegal immigrants to help care for her child.

“Your confidence in me to serve as the nation’s attorney general is the highest honor I can imagine,” she told Clinton. “Thank you again for your confidence and the opportunity you gave me.”

The announcement came after a day in which advisers to Clinton recommended privately that Baird withdraw from consideration and 11 senators announced opposition to her confirmation because she hired a Peruvian couple for domestic services, even though she knew that they could not work legally in the United States. She and her husband also failed to pay Social Security taxes on their wages.

In his statement, Clinton blamed the review process before Baird’s nomination for failing to completely evaluate the issue. “For that, I take full responsibility,” he said.

“You are highly qualified to be attorney general,” Clinton wrote in a personal letter to Baird. “I believe you would have been a fine attorney general.”

The President also told Baird that he hoped she would “be available for other assignments for your country in my Administration.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee had grilled Baird for nearly 9 1/2 hours Thursday about the issue. Six Republican senators publicly declared that they would vote against the Baird nomination and five Democrats demanded that she withdraw.

The 11 senators opposing the nomination included Senate Republican Whip Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), David L. Boren (D-Okla.), Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), John B. Breaux (D-La.), J. James Exon (D-Neb.), Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.), Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) and Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.).

Although the 40-year-old nominee impressed onlookers with her composure under fire, her prospects fell hour by hour as senators disclosed their opposition in news releases that arrived at the Judiciary Committee hearing room and telephone calls opposed to the nomination clogged the Senate switchboard.

In a closed-door meeting of the Democratic caucus at noon Thursday, senators were sharply divided over the issue. There was “considerable controversy” over her actions, conceded Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who supports Baird.

Privately, even Baird’s two home state senators--Democrats Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman--had told associates that they believed the nomination had no chance, according to a source close to them.

A spokesman for Lieberman, who is close to Clinton and was one of Baird’s chief sponsors, said the senator had not conveyed any recommendation to Clinton.

A key Democrat on the committee, Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, said Baird’s confirmation problems were serious. “There are several of us (Democrats) certainly not committed for her, including me,” he said Thursday.

Baird had drawn support from some influential Republicans, including Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the Judiciary Committee’s ranking Republican. But Clinton was not willing to go ahead with the nomination if a majority of his own party no longer supported it, a senior White House official said.

Although White House vote counters believed that Baird still could have prevailed on the Senate floor, the real battle was in “the court of public opinion,” a Clinton adviser said.

“People can understand this,” the adviser said. Voters see Baird, a corporate lawyer earning $507,000 a year, as part of “a class of people who think they are above the law.”

Baird had repeatedly denied the suggestion that she sees herself that way. Nonetheless, “the average guy gets that,” the adviser said. “It’s Sununu with the airplanes,” he added, comparing Baird’s conduct with one of the most embarrassing chapters of the George Bush Administration. John H. Sununu lost his job as Bush’s chief of staff when he was accused of unauthorized use of government aircraft.

At the White House, where aides had begun focusing on damage control, Clinton’s spokesman prepared the way for dropping the controversial nominee by asserting that the President had not known the details of Baird’s conduct when he announced her nomination last month.

Baird told transition officials about her actions, spokesman George Stephanopoulos said, but did not discuss them directly with Clinton. And although transition officials did tell Clinton about the problem, “I do not know what level of detail he knew about the situation,” Stephanopoulos said.

Asked if Clinton continued to support Baird, Stephanopoulos said then that “President Clinton continues to believe she’ll make a good attorney general.” But he unmistakably qualified his support by saying that Baird was Clinton’s nominee “right now.”

And asked if Clinton would have appointed Baird if he knew at the time what he knows now about her conduct, Stephanopoulos repeatedly demurred saying: “I can’t answer that.”

White House officials had grown increasingly concerned about how much the Baird controversy could damage Clinton’s effort to portray himself as a champion of ethical behavior, and they worried about how many political chits Clinton would have to use up in an effort to salvage the nomination.

Already, they said, Clinton has suffered several blows because of the nomination--criticism from liberals because of Baird’s advocacy of corporate interests, worries from some supporters about her lack of criminal-law experience and her youth and now the controversy over her personal conduct.

Despite the pressures, however, the nominee remained calm in her second long day of questioning before the Judiciary Committee. “I think that my overall record gives me the potential to be a great attorney general,” she said. “The power of my overall record and the potential I have to serve this country . . . should override the particulars” of her violation of immigration law, she declared.

She even smiled when Simpson, a co-author of the immigration law that she violated, said he reluctantly would be voting against her nomination because of her misdeed.

“I appreciate your candor,” she told Simpson, expressing a hope that Simpson, like the 23 senators who voted against confirmation of Griffin B. Bell as attorney general in 1977, would say at the end of her term that she had done a great job.

The only time Baird’s voice seemed to quiver was when she described the “tensions” she encountered while trying to balance her roles as the mother of an 8-month-old son and as general counsel of Aetna Casualty and Life Insurance Co.

On another issue that could have proved to be a problem, Baird confirmed that her husband, Yale Law School professor Paul Gewirtz, had attended a meeting of their neighborhood association, which subsequently was sued by the Justice Department for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Law.

The association allegedly sought to block a woman with 10 foster and adopted children, most of them handicapped, from moving into the neighborhood.

“I learned in the last couple of days that he attended a neighborhood association meeting,” Baird testified, adding that Gewirtz attended to explain the civil rights laws to the members and “not as a participant to exclude anyone.” She praised Gewirtz as a leading constitutional scholar and civil rights advocate. But Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, cited the case as he called on Baird to withdraw her name voluntarily.

Baird continued to receive support from some influential senators, including Hatch, who said that she is the victim of a telephone “smear campaign” that should not be allowed to derail her confirmation.

But her conduct had drawn widespread criticism, with radio talk-show hosts across the country keeping up a steady drumbeat of criticism and the Senate switchboard receiving a tidal wave of telephone calls from angry constituents.

The office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), for example, said late Thursday it had received 2,872 calls against the nominee and 208 in favor. DeConcini said his offices had received 305 negative calls and only four in support of Baird.

Even those senators who publicly still supported Baird acknowledged that she faced a major obstacle. “I think she’s a very qualified individual, but what she did was more than jaywalking,” Dodd told a reporter.

After two years of research and studies, the scientific understanding surrounding the danger of the spike protein has evolved quite a lot.

At first, when the pandemic first began, people thought that the spike protein was just there to help the virus enter human cells, and that was it.

However, over time, researchers have slowly discovered that the effects of the spike protein are multifaceted and that it’s harmful to the human body in at least eight different ways—such as by damaging the cells of our lungs, damaging our cells’ mitochondria, causing inflammation, and even increasing the risk of blood clots.

Furthermore, all of this is compounded by the fact that, according to new studies, the spike protein can persist in the human body for weeks, or even months, after a person gets vaccinated.

So let’s explore what the potential dangers of the spike protein are—as well as some concrete actions that you can take to detoxify yourself and boost your own immune system.

527,"""REMARKS OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP – AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY

INAUGURAL ADDRESS

FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2017

WASHINGTON, D.C.

As Prepared for Delivery –

Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.

Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.

Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.

Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.

For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.

Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.

Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.

The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.

Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.

That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.

This is your day. This is your celebration.

And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.

January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

Everyone is listening to you now.

You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.

At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.

These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.

But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.

We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;

Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;

We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;

And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.

One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.

But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.

We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.

Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.

We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.

We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.

When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.

When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.

There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.

We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.

Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.

In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.

We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

The time for empty talk is over.

Now arrives the hour of action.

Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.

We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.

So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:

You will never be ignored again.

Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.""",1

 George Soros was said arrested in Switzerland at 13:23 GMT on Feb. 3 2019. Evidently members of what was known as the Alliance stormed his retreat at Saint Margrethenberg, Switzerland based on a tip from local police. The Alliance was a military force working under orders of the Pentagon, GITMO Military Tribunal Judges and in conjunction with legal entities across the globe. 
 Soros has been suspected to illegally influence US elections over the years, was thought behind thousands of immigrants forcing their way across the US Border, his organizations were believed to own and control software used in state voting machines and even worse, the multi billionaire was known to be a leader in the Vatican's Ninth Circle Satanic Cult. He was thought behind regularly scheduled Satanic Child Sacrifice Rites and Human Hunting Parties organized under the Vatican and involving children and kidnapped teens across the globe according to Kevin Annette of ITCCS (www.itccs.org). 
 Evidently the Alliance had enough evidence supplied by former US President Barak Obama and other informants at GITMO to arrest Soros. Obama was believed to have been incarcerated at GITMO for at least a month, exposing crimes of upper echelons of the Deep State to save his own skin. Obama was thought to have been charged with High Treason for multiple crimes including Uranium One and the Benghazi massacre. 
 Believed to be in poor health Soros was reported to have been prevented from committing suicide with a cyanide pill prior to capture. Presently he was thought to be under interrogation at a bunker near Gasternal, Switzerland.

Doctor on COVID Vax: ""We Screwed-Up. We didn't realize the Spike Protein is a TOXIN"" Does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own Spike Protein Toxins in their own bodies?

Audio from a radio show has emerged wherein Dr. Byram Bridle reveals the scientists behind the COVID-19 ""Vaccine"" made a terrible mistake.

According to the Doctor, who cites a brand new, peer-reviewed research study out of Japan ""They made a mistake - they thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, only to discover it is a toxin, that can travel to many organs of the body, causing severe damage.""





WORSE, the spike proteins generated by mRNA vaccines don’t stay in the shoulder muscle, but spread to the brain, heart, ovaries, etc.

They also know that the spike protein is what causes the damage with COVID—and now it is clear how it is causing so much damage in other parts of the bodies of the vaccinated.

From the video below Dr. Bridle on why the vax injuries are happening:

Spike protein, on its own is the cause of the vascular, neurodegenerative, problems, not the virus.

In the original theory it stay's in deltoid, goes to local draining lymph node, activates immune system.

But a new bio-distribution study from Japan tracked the vax and spike proteins.

It gets into the blood within days of vax, accumulates in spleen, brain, bone marrow, liver, adrenal glands, with high concentrations in ovaries.

Spike protein is a pathogenic toxin that causes damage if in circulation, binds to platelets, epithelial cells of blood vessels, clotting, bleeding, heart problems, brain blood clotting.



Conclusion is ""We made a big mistake, and didn't realize it till now."" ""We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen but never knew the spike protein itself was a pathogenic toxin protein."" ""By vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.""

Give ear to this 8 Minute video. If this Doctor is correct, and if the peer-reviewed report (HERE) is accurate, almost everyone who took the vaccine is going to be dead very soon because their own bodies are now manufacturing the very spike protein which is a Toxin that will kill them.

The spike proteins generated by both the mRNA vaccines don’t stay in the shoulder muscle, but spread to the brain, heart, ovaries, etc. They also know that the spike protein is what causes the damage with Covid—and now it is clear how it is causing so much damage in other parts of the bodies of the vaccinated.

 On May 2 Real Raw News reported that U.S. Special Forces under White Hat authority had raided a Moderna Covid-19 vaccine repository and destroyed approximately 250,000 vials of the company's precious clot shots. Additional information has become known, and we can now report that the Special Forces team had confiscated several boxes of vaccines prior to destroying the stockpile. 
 The product was then shipped to White Hats at U.S. Army Medical Research Command (USAMRDC) for chemical analysis. Fort Deitrick Deputy Commander Col. Andrew C. Kim personally oversaw the tests and on 6 May forwarded the results to the office of Marine Corps General David H. Berger. 
 A source within the general's office relayed the findings to RRN. 
 According to him, 10 of 60 vials contained insecticides, or more specifically moderate concentrations of cypermethrin and resmethrin, synthetic pesticides found commonly in products like Ortho Home Defense. Although neurotoxicity via ingestion by humans is toxic but 'generally weak', sufficient quantities or potent concentrations of these products can affect the nervous system in humans.

The study followed over 1,600 people who had either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy surgery and matched them to a control group of over 2,100 individuals with obesity who did not undergo surgery. Results showed that surgery reduced the risk of breast cancer by almost 50% over ten years, but there were no risk reductions for other types of cancer. However, the overall ten-year survival rate was higher for those who had surgery, with fewer cardiac events and cancers reported. Another study published in JAMA with over 30,000 patients also concluded that bariatric surgery lowers the risk of obesity-related cancers.

The drug reduces levels of SOD1 and neurofilament light protein, a molecular marker of neurological damage. An open-label extension is ongoing, monitoring motor function. Tofersen is not designed to block production of the SOD1 protein. The FDA did not accept Biogen's new drug application for tofersen in July. Approximately 20,000 people in the US have ALS, a fatal disease that kills nerve cells controlling voluntary movements.

712,"""On January 21, 2020, the United States confirmed its first case of COVID-19. One year later, the country is still breaking grim records: January 2021 was the deadliest month of the pandemic yet, claiming more than 95,000 Americans, about one-fifth of the 433,751 deaths recorded to date, according to The Atlantic’s COVID Tracking Project.

The U.S. hit this mark even as the pandemic seems to be letting up, at least for now. Conditions have been improving since January 13, when the most reliable indicator of the coronavirus’s spread, hospitalizations, began a steady decline, from more than 130,000 to fewer than 95,000. The day before, the seven-day average of new cases began falling, and it has dipped from more than 246,000 to fewer than 143,000, a number not seen since mid-November. But the seven-day average of daily deaths remains above 3,000, as it’s been almost every day since January 9.

The death toll is poised to drop soon as well: There is a lag between when someone falls sick with COVID-19 and when they die (on average about two weeks), and another lag between when someone dies and when that death gets tallied by states (on average one week), so the deaths being reported now reflect the worst conditions of the pandemic. You can see this delay in how deaths have followed hospitalizations at the regional level. In the Midwest, where the death toll is already decreasing, hospitalizations peaked at the beginning of December, and deaths began to decline in the middle of the month. Hospitalizations in the Northeast peaked almost a month ago, and deaths started falling a couple of weeks ago. Meanwhile, we’re slightly more than two weeks out from the peak of hospitalizations in the South and the West, which both had higher peaks than other regions during this surge, and the daily-death averages there may be just on the verge of declining. Once they do, the national numbers should begin to reflect that trend.

Read: Hospitalizations are down

But the decline in the death toll will be slow, if the prior two nationwide surges are any indication. Both took longer to fall than they did to rise: In the spring, for instance, it took less than two weeks for the seven-day deaths average to rise from 1,000 to 2,000, but about a month for it to recede to back under 1,000. While doctors and nurses have developed better treatment plans since then, the current surge has a peak that is substantially higher than that of the two prior ones, so the seven-day deaths average is almost certain to remain in the thousands for several more weeks.

February may represent a turning point in the pandemic, especially as the country’s vaccination campaign ramps up. But this month will continue to be deadly: Deaths have occurred that have yet to be reported, hospitalized patients will die, and thousands of new cases will turn into deaths. Even as the U.S climbs down from the pandemic’s peak, the country risks passing the monumental milestone—half a million deaths—by the end of the month.""",1

The main focus of vaccines remains how many hospitalizations and deaths they prevent, rather than breakthrough infections. The study's co-author suggests that the total benefit of the vaccines may be underestimated as the model looks only at acute infection.

This highlights the importance of promoting and educating people about the importance of diet during pregnancy and critical periods for health. It's not important to blame mothers for their kids' health, but it is important for women to consider what kinds of foods they are eating and, if possible, to avoid ultra-processed foods. Physical activity is also important during the reproductive years and pregnancy.

We're sure the 'fact checkers' are already hard at work trying to debunk the pre-print, however they may also want to take a look at ivmmeta.com - a real-time meta analysis of 70 studies which found that Ivermectin works as a prophylaxis 83% of the time. In peer-reviewed studies, it was found effective 70% of the time as an early treatment, and just 39% of the time as a late treatment.

Ivermectin

This widely prescribed anti-parasitic which is also used in horses has shown meaningful efficacy worldwide in the treatment of mild and moderate cases of Covid-19, plus as a prophylactic. India's Uttar Pradesh province, with a population of over 200 million, says that widespread early use of Ivermectin 'helped keep positivity [and] deaths low.'

Separately, there have been several studies funded by the Indian government, primarily conducted through their largest govt. public medical university (AIIMS).

Role of ivermectin in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in India: A matched case-control study (source) Conclusion: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 μg/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month .

Ivermectin as a potential treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 – A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (source) Conclusion: There was no difference in the primary outcome i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 of admission with the use of ivermectin. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged alive from the hospital when they received ivermectin .

Clinical Research Report Ivermectin in combination with doxycycline for treating COVID-19 symptoms: a randomized trial (source, double-blind randomized, peer-reviewed) Discussion: In the present study, patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection treated with ivermectin in combination with doxycycline generally recovered 2 days earlier than those treated with placebo . The proportion of patients responding within 7 days of treatment was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group. The proportions of patients who remained symptomatic after 12 days of illness and who experienced disease progression were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group. Here are more human studies from other countries on the 'horse dewormer': Peru: Sharp Reductions in COVID-19 Case Fatalities and Excess Deaths in Peru in Close Time Conjunction, State-By-State, with Ivermectin Treatments (source, peer-reviewed, University of Toronto, Universidad EAFIT) For the 24 states with early IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths dropped 59% (25%) at +30 days and 75% (25%) at +45 days after day of peak deaths . Case fatalities likewise dropped sharply in all states but Lima Spain:

The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: A pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (source, University of Barcelona, peer-reviewed) Findings: Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001) .

Bengladesh: A Comparative Study on Ivermectin-Doxycycline and Hydroxychloroquine- Azithromycin Therapy on COVID-19 Patients (source - peer reviewed, though not govt funded) Conclusion: According to our study, the Ivermectin-Doxycycline combination therapy has better symptomatic relief, shortened recovery duration, fewer adverse effects, and superior patient compliance compared to the Hydroxychloroquine- Azithromycin combination. Based on this study's outcomes, the Ivermectin-Doxycycline combination is a superior choice for treating patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease . A five-day course of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 may reduce the duration of illness (source, peer-reviewed double blind randomized, though small sample size) Discussion: A 5-day course of ivermectin resulted in an earlier clearance of the virus compared to placebo (p = 0.005), thus indicating that early intervention with this agent may limit viral replication within the host. In the 5-day ivermectin group, there was a significant drop in CRP and LDH by day 7, which are indicators of disease severity.

Why does Ivermectin, a 'horse dewormer' work? For starters, it's a protease inhibitor. Interestingly, Pfizer's 2x/day Covid-19 prophylactic they're trialing right now is also a protease inhibitor.

Perhaps the most damning evidence in favor of Ivermectin is the medical establishment's position that it's essentially snake oil, despite the fact that it's had a glowing safety profile for decades, until now.""",1

It has been revealed that the standard tests being used in the US to diagnose Covid-19 cases are far too sensitive, with the vast majority of people marked down as being positive actually turning out to be negative.

Top US virologists have been stunned by revelations about the laxity of the US Covid testing regimen. It turns out that tests that deliver a simple binary “positive or negative” result are not fit for purpose, as they tell us nothing about the contagiousness of each person.

Data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – shows that when the amount of the virus found in a person is taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who have tested positive should actually have been negative, as they are carrying only tiny amounts of the virus, are not contagious, pose no risk to others, and have no need to isolate.

This means that only a fraction of the daily “cases” being reported so hysterically in the mainstream media are actual, bona fide Covid-19 sufferers, and need treatment and to separate themselves from others.

It’s a sensitive issue

So how could this have happened? The answer has to do with the sensitivity of PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) tests for Covid, which it turns out can be ramped up according to the taste of the testing companies. Most testing companies have chosen the outrageously high sensitivity limit of 40 PCR cycles – meaning that the DNA in a sample is exponentially increased 40 times in order to amplify its signal.

But using such a ridiculously sensitive test means that the faintest traces of a dead virus, or even leftovers from previous infections, can result in a positive. Professor Juliet Morrison, a University of California virologist, said that even a limit of 35 PCR cycles is too high, let alone 40. She said she was “shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive.” But apparently, pretty much everyone in the US Covid brain trust took exactly that on faith.

So the scale of the pandemic ‘problem’ is actually much smaller than we’ve been led to believe – about a tenth of what all the politicians and media have been using to justify the lockdowns, the quarantines, the mass testing. Some may be shocked that the scale of the problem is so much smaller than assumed. But for a seasoned ignorer of any and all statistics that contain Covid ‘cases’, there are no surprises here. The truth is, there was never any reason to be confident in such figures. The FDA has only now been forced to concede that they have no idea how different testing companies determine which the positive and negative tests are: they just accept whatever data they are given.

What these findings bring is absolute assurance that the testing to this point has been an utter waste of time, and that not one statistic concerning this pandemic – from cases to deaths to infection rates – can be believed. But it should not have taken some journalist to ask the right question to discover this: a bit of common sense would have been enough. What is it going to take for these professional virologists to drop their assumptions and models, and just start acting based on the facts at hand?

Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal

Scrap test and trace

It’s a virus so deadly, you need a test to tell whether you have it or not. So goes the refrain of many lockdown skeptics, Covidiots and anti-maskers, of whom I am an indignant supporter. Something has gone… not just wrong, but totally haywire... when the might of the world’s scientific establishment is trained with the zeal of a Witchfinder General on one particular microscopic particle. Not even a particularly dangerous particle; the latest data show it is the eighth most common cause of death in England, and it doesn’t make the top ten in Wales.

Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the original source of this disease, the pool parties are in full swing. They don’t seem to be too worried about PCR tests or contact tracing, or even the virus itself. The Chinese government says that their supreme lockdown was so awesome that they now have zero Covid: a biological impossibility. Maybe they just stopped testing, and decided to get on with their lives. Everyone else should take a leaf out of their book.

CDC Removes 24 Percent of Child COVID-19 Deaths, Thousands of Others

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed tens of thousands of deaths linked to COVID-19, including nearly a quarter of deaths it had listed in those under 18 years old.

The health agency quietly made the change on its data tracker website on March 15.

“Data on deaths were adjusted after resolving a coding logic error. This resulted in decreased death counts across all demographic categories,” the CDC says on the site.

The CDC relies on states and other jurisdictions to report COVID-19 deaths and acknowledges on its website that the data is not complete.

But the statistics are often cited by doctors and others when pushing for COVID-19 vaccination, including figures who believe virtually all children should be vaccinated. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC’s director, cited the tracker’s death total in November 2021 while pushing for an expert panel to advise her agency to recommend vaccination for all children 5- to 11-years-old.

Before the change, the CDC listed 1,755 children as dying from COVID-19 along with approximately 852,000 total, according to Kelley Krohnert, a Georgia resident who has been tracking the updates.

The update saw the CDC cut 416 deaths among children and over 71,000 elsewhere, arriving at a total of just under 780,000.

The agency declined to provide a comment by deadline.

The CDC previously adjusted its death count in August 2021 “after the identification of a data discrepancy.”

“The update is an improvement, but it’s at least the third correction to this data, and still does not solve the issue. It just highlights that people have been using a flawed source of data when discussing kids and COVID,” Krohnert told The Epoch Times in an email.

Some journalists and doctors have been citing the tracker data while others use a tally that is managed by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has been described by the agency as more reliable.

The NCHS tally, which is compiled from death certificates, currently lists 921 deaths involving COVID-19 among children and some 966,000 deaths involving COVID-19 among other age groups.

The deaths in the tally include people who died with COVID-19 and people who died from COVID-19, a CDC spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email in January. COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause, or the primary death cause, on about 90 percent of death certificates at the time.

An electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2 (round gold objects), which causes COVID-19, emerging from cultured cells. (NIAID)

Some of the deaths listed by the CDC appear unrelated to COVID-19. For instance, several deaths her drowning as a cause of death; several others were listed as being from a gun discharge, according to an Epoch Times review of the death codes.

The CDC has over the pandemic become less-trusted by Americans, according to surveys. A Pew Research Center survey in February found a 10 percentage point drop in the percent of respondents who said they think the CDC is doing a good or excellent job.

For now, the update on the tracker was described as “great news” by Dr. Alasdair Munro, a clinical research fellow for pediatric infectious diseases at University Hospital Southampton, given that nearly a quarter of the pediatric COVID-19 deaths had vanished.

But Munro, writing on social media, called it “slightly worrying that this data was being used widely in the US to guide or advocate for policy.”

Some people called for the CDC to issue a public apology or at least announce such updates, similar to how some lower-level agencies have made clear lowering their death counts.

“It’s outrageous to quietly footnote such a consequential error,” Jessica Adams, a former regulatory review officer at the Food and Drug Administration, said on Twitter.

A former CDC spokesperson, though, noted the CDC website outlines that the data are estimated and subject to change.

“There is much complexity involved in all systems that are trying to track and summarize illness and death data, including differences in how data are collected and reported, completeness and accuracy of data, how timely data is entered into data collection systems and reported to CDC, and in the assumptions made, and procedures used to determine whether COVID-19 was the primary cause of death, a contributing cause of death, or not likely a contributing factor in someone’s death,” Glen Nowak, the former spokesperson, who is now an associate dean for research and graduate studies at the University of Georgia, told The Epoch Times in an email.

“It is thus not surprising that adjustments or revisions happen, including as a result of coding-related issues (e.g., recognizing, as more cases and information are provided, that a better way to enter, analyze, and/or interpret the data existed).”

Nowak said he wasn’t surprised the CDC did not announce the adjustment, given the disclaimers, asserting that announcements by federal agencies “are best reserved for events or developments that have or could have significant impact on government recommendations or policies.”""",1

862,"""Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist and leader in the medical response to the COVID-19 disaster throughout the pandemic, urged the public to abstain from additional Covid vaccination.

Those who have already received a dose or two of the experimental mRNA shots will dramatically increase the risk of suffering from its debilitating or lethal side effects if they receive a third dose, McCullough told the Gateway Pundit during the Defeat The Mandates rally on Sunday in Washington, DC.

“Vaccines are largely unnecessary and if there was a safe and effective vaccine–if … the only application, in my view, would be our high-risk seniors, those in nursing homes, congregate living centers. Potentially, direct health care workers for our seniors. That’s it,” he said. “In the United States, that’s fewer than 3 million people would ever get a vaccine. I think we’ve seen the end of a broad employment of vaccines. It’s obviously backfired. Vaccination should only be narrow and targeted for highest risk group.

As of yet, there is no established method or understanding of how to dispel the mRNA technology from the body, or detox from vaccine injury, the Texas-based physician contends:

TRENDING: **HUGE BREAKING NEWS** -- Wisconsin Assembly Votes to Advance Rep. Ramthun's Resolution to Reclaim Wisconsin's Electors For President and Vice President That Were Certified Under Fraudulent Purposes -- VIDEO

“For the genetic vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca, there is no known detoxification methods. Sadly, the genetic material lasts in the body far longer than what we thought and the spike protein that’s produced is probably in the body for greater than a year and it’s in vital areas, including the brain, the lung, the heart, the bone marrow, the reproductive organs. And it takes a very long time for the body to clear out this dangerous, foreign, protein. The only thing I can advise individuals is, don’t take anymore of it. There is going to be a progressive accumulation of spike protein in the human body that cannot get out. It will almost certainly lead to chronic disease. “Worldwide, the vaccine programs have backfired, meaning those countries that have the highest use of vaccines have the highest mortality rates.”

Not only are Covid vaccines hazardous and deadly, but hospitals across the United States are dangerously adhering to new Covid protocols that are a death sentence for Covid-infected in-patients, McCullough warns:

Right now when patients are receiving outpatient care, they come into the hospital — there is the cessation of care. The hospitals have clearly locked themselves into protocols and these protocols have now been evaluated. A recent analysis by Christine Burns in Jama, [India] has shown that the protocols are not trustworthy. That they don’t commit to giving the risks, benefits or treatment. They don’t give expert reviews or updating. And these protocols are effectively not offering patients the quality of care that they should receive. Because they don’t receive high intensity, high quality of care, lives are lost. There’s a process called ‘medication reconciliation,’ meaning the outpatient drugs that we use should be continued as an inpatient — and they include Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, the use of monoclonal antibodies, it doesn’t matter if they are just in the ER or just on the other side, in an admission. The use of cortical steroids, Colitsine, aspirin… There should be no barriers between the inpatient and outpatient realm in terms of continuation of care.

Covid-positive patients are typically provided Remdesiver, a drug that deteriorates the kidneys and the liver, in hospitals. As the patient’s health declines, doctors in adherence with the new emergency Covid regulations then subject those they are responsible for curing to endotracheal intubation, a procedure that will likely kill them.

They are given a very meager dose of a glucose cortercoid, which is Dethamethasone, and then get Remdesivir, which is far too late,” Dr. McCullough said. “Remdesivir — its only hope is given very early against viral replications. Sadly, it’s given too late to patients who only experience renal and hepatic toxicities.

McCullough concurs with the increasingly prevalent estimation that the coronavirus pandemic and the government’s all-encompassing effort to vaccinate the entire population is a scheme to depopulate humanity.""",1

Pope Francis has scandalized victims of sexual abuse by declaring that pedophilia is a mysterious illness and we must not judge those who are suffering from it. Instead, according to the pope, we must accept that God loves pedophiles, he created them for a reason, and he has reserved a special place in heaven for them.

According to Francis, we must accept pedophiles because they have existed throughout history, in all cultures and societies. “Sexual abuse of minors is, and historically has been, a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies,” he said. “I am reminded of the cruel religious practice, once widespread in certain cultures, of sacrificing human beings – frequently children – in pagan rites.”

Pope Francis’ statements have scandalized victims of clerical sex abuse, and understandably so. Activists for survivors of clerical sexual abuse have reacted furiously after Pope Francis refused to promise a “zero tolerance” approach to pedophile priests and the bishops who cover up their crimes as he closed a summit at the Vatican.

Watch:

But should we really be surprised by Francis’s position?

This is the Pope who takes every opportunity to declare the Bible is wrong, after all. He kicked off his papacy by declaring evolution and the big bang theory were real.

This is the pope who informed his flock that “relationships with Jesus are dangerous and harmful.” Breaking with centuries of Christian tradition, Pope Francis sparked fears that he is an illegitimate pope with a sinister agenda when he told a crowd of 33,000 pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.

And as though that wasn’t disturbing enough, Francis followed up with the equally sinister proclamation that “Jesus is Satan.”

Pope Francis is a fully-paid up member of the globalist elite. And don’t forget – to the elite, bad is good.

As an Agenda Contributor at the World Economic Forum, Pope Francis is fluent in blasphemy and is actively working to subvert the church and Christianity in general.

Pope Francis’ inverted version of Christianity is confusing for many, however his agenda becomes much easier to understand when you realize who the pontiff is really serving. To quote French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, Pope Francis is a “globalist bulldog” who is loyal to the New World Order.

In 2017, Pope Francis called for a “one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat issues such as “climate change.” Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations does not have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”

This includes Americans, he stressed, who according to the pope must be ruled by a world government “for their own good.”

Now, Pope Francis is actively defying Biblical scripture by working to create a “one world religion.”

In 2019, Pope Francis signed a historic covenant with leaders of the world’s major faiths, pushing us much closer to a one-world religion, one of the major goals of the New World Order.

According to the document produced by Pope Francis and published on the Vatican’s official website, all religions must be considered equal, and Islam is as acceptable to God as Christianity.

He then shocked the Christian world by hosting Islamic prayers and Quran recitals in the Vatican.

Christians around the world should visit mosques and praise Allah, according to Pope Francis who led by example on his visit to Istanbul by entering the Blue Mosque, taking off his shoes, facing Mecca, and praising the Muslim god.

As though he hadn’t already made it clear that he is not a man of God, Francis then hosted a pagan ceremony including brazen idol worship on Vatican grounds.

Only time will tell if Pope Francis’s depraved and corrupt vision of the future is accepted by Catholics around the world, but one thing’s for sure: traditional conservative Christians are not going down without a fight.

And nor should they.

The globalist elite have issued a series of chilling warnings to the people of the world: hand over your sovereignty and accept the New World Order, or face certain death. They claim that only by handing over our freedom and autonomy to the elite can we hope to avoid the catastrophes that are looming on the horizon.

This power-hungry cabal of billionaires and politicians has long plotted to enslave the masses, and now they think they have all their ducks lined up they are making their move.

But more and more people are refusing to submit to the global elite’s tyrannical demands. Brave men and women are rising up to fight back against the elite, determined to defend their sovereignty at any cost, determined to protect their families and most importantly, protect their children from the ravenous wolves.

Will you join them in the fight for freedom, or will you cower in fear and submit to the demands of the global elite? The choice is yours. But whatever you do, do not underestimate the consequences of your choices.

If you choose to stand up and fight, then welcome to the fold. I know at times it can feel dark and lonely, but the masses are waking up and the elite won’t be able to takeover as easily as they thought they could.

Switzerland has ordered an immediate halt to Covid-19 vaccinations and withdrawn all vaccination recommendations. Doctors are only permitted to administer the controversial vaccines in exceptional cases and under specific conditions, but they will bear the risk of liability for vaccination-related damage.

According to the vaccination recommendation released by the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG) and the Federal Commission for Vaccination Issues (EKIF) on April 3, which can be accessed on this website, this is the current situation:

BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. Email *

Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Δ

In principle, the FOPH and EKIF will not formulate a recommendation for vaccination against Covid-19 in spring/summer 2023 due to the expected low virus circulation and the high level of immunity in the population.

Vaccination is only possible in individual and unique cases – namely:

Vaccination is possible for people who are particularly at risk (BGP) ≥ 16 years of age if the attending physician considers it to be medically indicated in the respective epidemiological situation in the individual case, a temporarily increased protection against serious illness is to be expected and the last vaccination dose at least 6 months ago.

However, there is no specific vaccination recommendation provided even for individuals who are at risk.

The BAG’s recommendations could alter if there is a new wave of outbreaks; however, the document states that vaccinations are no longer recommended for individuals under the age of 65, even in such circumstances.

According to the Swiss government, there is no favorable risk-benefit ratio, as stated in the comments on “Adverse Vaccine Reactions.”

According to the current state of knowledge,the risk of severe UIEwith a recommended vaccination is much lower than the risk of a complication from Covid-19, against which the vaccination protects.The benefit of the vaccination administered according to the recommendation therefore outweighs the possible risks.

In the case of the valid non-recommendation, this essentially means that there is no longer a positive benefit-risk ratio for any Covid vaccination.

Liability: the government is out, doctors have a duty

The new recommendations also have consequences for liability. This is what the BAG document on the Covid vaccination strategy (as of November 29th, 2022) says:

Compensation by the federal government to injured persons for vaccination damage can only be considered for vaccinations if they were officially recommended or ordered (see Art. 64 EpG).

However, the federal government only stepped in if the damage was not covered by the vaccine manufacturer, the person vaccinating or an insurance company. The person vaccinating – i.e. generally the doctor – can be held liable if he has breached his duty of care. In this context, it is pointed out that the same rules regarding patient information apply to the Covid vaccination as to all other vaccinations.

Very few doctors are likely to have informed their patients about all the risks and side effects and the limited effectiveness of the Covid vaccinations. For doctors, the justification of vaccinations is becoming more difficult due to the changed recommendations, according to a BAG document on liability issues:

If the doctor treating you bases his/her choice or prescription on the vaccination recommendations of the BAG, he/she can prove that he/she has observed the recognized rules of medical and pharmaceutical sciences and has therefore complied with the duty of care under the law on medicinal products.

The Weltwoche reports that from now on doctors will be liable for deaths and injuries resulting from vaccinations – which means that their willingness to vaccinate is likely to decrease significantly.""",1

The trial found ivermectin has ""an antiviral effect"" against the variant, Kowa said without providing further details. The firm has been working with Kitasato University, a medical university in Tokyo.

Clinical trials evaluating the drug, which is used to treat parasites in animals and humans, are ongoing but promotion of the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has generated controversy.

The drug is not approved for treatment of COVID-19 in Japan and the U.S. Federal Drug Administration has repeatedly warned against its use.

1027,"""Further evidence proving the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a huge failure has been released which confirms throughout the whole of August 80% of the people who allegedly died of Covid-19 had been vaccinated against the disease.

We’re living in strange times, and if you believe the Covid-19 vaccination programme is working because the authorities on the television tell you that it is, then you must surely find it extremely strange that the UK is in the middle of a third wave in the middle of summer? Especially when you consider that in summer 2020 Covid-19 deaths flat-lined to zero even though a Covid-19 injection was not available.

But the strangeness doesn’t end there, just take a look at the latest Covid-19 Statistical Report released by Public Health Scotland (PHS) on the 8th September 2021.

The report provides an array on data on testing, quarantining, vaccinations, cases, hospitalisations, and deaths but it doesn’t get very interesting until you read Table 15 which covers the number of Covid-19 positive cases by week and vaccination status.

Interesting because it shows that the majority of confirmed cases are now among the vaccinated population. In the most recent week from 28th August to 3rd September 2021 the report shows that there were 20,744 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population, who are more likely to be tested for the simple reason they have not been vaccinated.

But it also shows that there were 5,508 confirmed cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 16,810 cases among the fully vaccinated population – two populations who are least likely to be tested due to be being vaccinated.

This means that between 28th August and 3rd September there were 22,318 cases among the vaccinated population – almost 2,000 more than the unvaccinated population.

The same can also be said for the week of 21st August to 27th August which saw 15,647 cases among the unvaccinated population and 22,234 cases among the vaccinated population, and the same can also be said for the previous two weeks before that.

The data actually shows that between 7th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 47,580 cases among the unvaccinated population, 21,020 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 41,748 cases among the fully vaccinated population. Meaning there were 15,188 more cases among the vaccinated population.

So now that we’ve cleared up that the experimental Covid-19 injections clearly do not prevent infection or spread of Covid-19, let’s find out if they prevent hospitalisations like the authorities claim.

According to table 16 of the report between the 28th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 36 admissions to hospital related to Covid-19 among the unvaccinated over 60 population, whilst there were 7 admissions on the partly vaccinated population.

However, there were a huge 299 admissions among the fully vaccinated over 60 population, and the same pattern can be seen for the weeks previous all the way back to the 7th August 2021.

In all for the week of 28th August to 3rd September 2021 there were 271 hospitalisations among the entire unvaccinated population but 423 hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated population. If we base these hospitalisations occurring after the previous weeks confirmed cases then we can calculate the case-hospitalisation rate.

In the week beginning 21st August there were 15,047 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated hospitalisation figures of 271 in the week beginning 28th August the case-hospitalisation rate is 1.7%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (423) and cases (14,519) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 2.9%.

Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of hospitalisation when exposed to Covid-19 by 70% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.

So now that we’ve cleared up the Covid-19 injections increase the risk of hospitalisation rather than reducing it let’s find out if they prevent deaths like the authorities claim.

Table 17 of the Public Health Scotland report shows the number of deaths to have occurred via vaccination status. However, PHS have been very clever in the way they’ve presented the number of deaths. Because rather than present them on a week by week basis like they have with the number of cases and hospitalisations, they’ve instead included deaths all the way back to the 29th December.

This means they are including deaths from the height of the alleged second wave of Covid-19 where just 9% of the population had received a single dose, and just 0.1% of the entire population were fully vaccinated. Therefore, PHS are very sneakily able to give the impression that the majority of Covid-19 deaths are occurring among the unvaccinated population.

The above table is taken from the report released by Public Health Scotland on the 18th August 2021 and shows deaths due to Covid-19 by vaccination status between the 29th December 2020 and the 5th August 2021. As you can see anyone reading the report would be given the impression that the vaccines are doing a fantastic job at preventing death due to Covid-19.

But fast forward to the most recent report and you will find on Table 17 that there have been 3,102 deaths among the unvaccinated population, 279 deaths among the partly vaccinated population and 298 deaths among the fully vaccinated population between the 29th December and the 26th August 2021.

Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 5th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –

Unvaccinated population – 25 deaths

Partly vaccinated population – 6 deaths

Fully vaccinated population – 92 deaths

This means the unvaccinated population have accounted for just 20% of alleged Covid-19 deaths throughout the whole of August, whilst the fully vaccinated accounted for 75% of them. But couple the partly vaccinated deaths with the fully vaccinated deaths and you can see that throughout August 80% of deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.

However this makes it hard to work out the case-fatality rate so to do this we need to look at how many deaths occurred in the previous weeks report. Up to the 19th August there had been 3,096 deaths among the unvaccinated, 277 deaths among the partly vaccinated, and 264 deaths among the fully vaccinated.

Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 19th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –

Unvaccinated population – 6 deaths

Partly vaccinated population – 2 deaths

Fully vaccinated population – 34 deaths

If we base these deaths on occurring two weeks after the number of confirmed cases then we can work out the case-fatality rate.

In the week beginning 7th August there were 3,788 confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated death figures of 6 in the week beginning 19th August the case-fatality rate is 0.15%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (34) and cases (3,490) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 1%.

Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of death when exposed to Covid-19 by a huge 566% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.

What’s even more concerning about this is that the number of confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population have rose significantly in the most recent week compared to four weeks prior. Therefore the number of hospitalisations and deaths that could occur in the next few weeks could possibly be enough for the authorities to justify another lockdown.

The data clearly shows the jabs do not prevent infection or transmission, and it clearly shows that they are increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death rather than reducing the risk.

1028,"""Arthur Roberts, the 83-year-old C-List actor who portrays Joseph Biden on television and in person, blew his cover during a televised press conference with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week. In a stunning scene seen by many, Biden’s (RRN uses the term ‘Biden’ to stand for either Biden or his body doubles) handlers abruptly and seemingly without cause ushered the press pool from the White House Briefing Room while Johnson tried to field questions from British journalists in attendance.

The stunned press pool protested as security forcibly ejected them, clueless as to why they, the administration’s MSM allies, were being rudely told to leave.

On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, who is currently under military investigation, said the room was cleared because Johnson’s questions were not preapproved, but a whistleblower in the fake administration’s communications office revealed to RRN what actually transpired during the surreal briefing.

As reported previously, it is RRN’s contention that the real Joseph R. Biden has not been seen in public since shortly after the 2020 presidential election. The reason is that, in early February, he suffered a massive stroke that left him brain dead and hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has lain comatose ever since. Biden’s Deep State handlers had had high hopes for Kamala Harris, and had intended that she would succeed him, but it soon became apparent that she lacked fortitude and the mental acuity needed to coalesce the liberal base. Much to her chagrin, she was put on the backburner while the Deep State sought body double replacements who could play a convincing Joe Biden.

One such find was Arthur Roberts, an obscure 80s actor whose capstone cinematic achievement was playing the evil ninja, Braden, in the 1984 martial arts flick Revenge of the Ninja. After that, he faded into obscurity, henceforth obtaining only minor roles in film and television productions, until the Deep State grabbed him as a potential Biden replacement in early March.

Roberts, no spring chicken himself and older than the genuine Biden, apparently has a touch of dementia, which caused him to veer off script and raise suspicion in the eyes of Boris Johnson.

In a moment not caught on microphone and spoken softly enough for the press pool to not overhear, Roberts began lamenting to Johnson his failed film career, and he asked the UK Prime Minister whether he had seen the films Little Miss Magic and Up in Smoke, in which he had minor roles.

A theatrically masked Boris Johnson, our source said, discretely muted his microphone and spoke softly in Roberts’ direction, asking, “You’re not Joe Biden. Who the bloody hell are you?”

“Even though he muted his mic, Jen Psaki and White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield were in another office, and able to overhear the entire discourse through hidden parabolic mics in the briefing room. They, how should I put this, freaked the fuck out. They began screaming into Roberts’ hidden earpiece to get back on script or read only from the teleprompter. That’s when Roberts silenced his own mic and told Boris he was only joking around. But Psaki feared the situation would deteriorate, and she immediately ordered the room cleared,” our source said.

He added that a bewildered Johnson later asked Psaki “what the hell just happened,” and was told to forget the entire incident, unless the UK wanted to lose all U.S. support.

The trial involved 4514 people from eight countries and spanned three influenza seasons. QIVc is manufactured using cell-based technology, which is an alternative to the egg-based manufacturing process typically used.

Funding for the research was provided by Seqirus, which also plans to build the Southern Hemisphere's first cell-based manufacturing facility in Australia.",1
1032,"New research shows that for people with type 2 diabetes, the success of long-term weight loss plans depends on the success of short-term diet plans. Participants who did not lose 0.5% of their body weight within the first four weeks of the weight-loss program were less likely to be successful in the long-term. The Glasgow weight management service did not emphasize behavioral changes, and participants should not be asked to follow the program for 3-4 months, nor aim to lose at least 5% of their body weight.

Early weight loss was found to be the most significant factor in predicting successful weight loss. Demographic, clinical, and process factors, including type of diabetes medication, did not make a significant difference in the success of weight loss.

Many people drop out of weight loss programs rather than seeing them through to completion, preventing them from achieving weight loss. The researchers recommend focusing efforts on patients early to prevent them from dropping out and failing in weight loss.

Less than 20% of people successfully lost at least 5% of their body weight and attended seven of nine weight management sessions. Those who lost at least 0.5% of their weight in the first three sessions over four weeks had a 90.4% chance of success in the short-term. After three years, only 8% had maintained the weight loss. A higher early weight loss of at least 2.5% in the first month increased the chance of success further.

The success of weight loss programs is not just about changing one's diet. Other factors affect success, and the researchers recommend finding the right program for each person.",1

1108,"""The U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps has amended how it will carry out future Deep State executions, a JAG source told Real Raw News. In the last two years all but two convicted Deep Staters were hanged by the neck until dead, a process JAG now says is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to mishaps. As a result, anyone convicted of capitol crime and sentenced to death will get a bullet to the brain.

Our source said JAG made the decision after weighing the cost and man-hours of past hangings against the cost of a few bullets. The practice of hanging a man, he said, involves more than simply stringing him up and flipping a switch. Ahead of each hanging, members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers arrive at GITMO to inspect the gallows, to ensure it functions properly, and remain there until the condemned is pronounced dead. But even their expertise hasn’t prevented mishaps; the execution of pedophile Bill Gates, for example, showed that improper rope measurement causes a prolonged, painful death.

Also, some executions were delayed pending the arrival of military brass, and sometimes politicians, who had to fly in from the mainland to witness the event.

More influential in JAG’s ruling, perhaps, is what Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall has called “gallows theatrics.” The interim between sentencing and execution has given flamboyant, grandstanding, unrepentant Deep Staters much time to sharpen their Thespian skills for melodramatic pre-execution productions. They have run the gamut from demonic incantations to alleged religious reformation, from final words laced with every profanity under the sun to acts of sexual depravity.

Once known for staying calm under pressure—and sometimes ribbing Deet Staters in their final moments of life—Vice Adm. Crandall has shown signs of frustration at recent executions, and referred to himself as a “circus ringmaster” after a lascivious Alec Baldwin dropped to his death.

“The admiral discussed his concerns with his juniors, and they agreed hangings take too long and are filled with too much theatre. They reached a consensus. From now on the convicted will be executed within 24 hours of sentencing, by gunfire instead of a noose,” our source said.

Asked how JAG would screen future firing squads, he shockingly said a “single Marine” would bear the burden of executing the condemned, and a backup would be readily available “just in case.”

This is a sharp deviation from historical practice. A firing squad is normally composed of several soldiers, all of whom are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by one member and identification of who fired the lethal shot.

“Although we’re talking about hardened Marines, psychological screening will take place, and it’s more efficient to briefly screen one or two Marines than seven to ten. Speaking for myself, why use 10 rounds of ammunition if one or two will do the job just as well. It’s not like anyone’s aiming for arms and legs,” our source said.

“There’s no written rule specifying the number of men. It can be one, it can be 20,” he added.

In closing, he told RRN that prospective candidates will be chosen entirely from a pool of volunteers, of which there are many.

1125,"""In Brief The Facts: A new study has examined some health outcomes of vaccinated children and unvaccinated children. They found that the vaccinated group require far more healthcare than the unvaccinated group.

Reflect On: Why are there no studies comparing the health of vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children? This is one of the first of its kind.

What Happened: A new study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health has, according to the authors, discovered that vaccinated children require far more healthcare than unvaccinated children. At least that’s what they found from the group of children used to collect the data.

This type of study is interesting to see given the fact that studies comparing unvaccinated children to vaccinated children are lacking, there aren’t many of them. These studies are, as the authors state, “rarely conducted.”

None of the post licensure-vaccine safety studies have included comparisons to groups completely unexposed to vaccines.

The study concludes that “the unvaccinated children in this practice are not, overall, less healthy than the vaccinated and that indeed the vaccinated children appear to be significantly less healthy than the unvaccinated.

The data source for this study was all billing and medical records of Integrative Pediatrics, a private pediatric practice located in Portland, Oregon.

The study emphasizes the need for more research given the fact that, again, there is hardly any in this area. They concur with Mawson et al., 2017 , who reported: “Further research involving larger, independent samples is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health” and with Hooker and Miller 2020, who wrote: “Further study is necessary to understand the full spectrum of health effects associated with childhood vaccination”.

These studies mentioned above also had similar findings.

According to the authors,

Vaccines are widely regarded as safe and effective within the medical community and are an integral part of the current American medical system. While the benefits of vaccination have been estimated in numerous studies, negative and nonspecific impact of vaccines on human health have not been well studied. Most recently, it has been determined that variation exists in individual responses to vaccines, that differences exist in the safety profile of live and inactivated vaccines, and that simultaneous administration of live and inactivated vaccines may be associated with poor outcomes. Studies have not been published that report on the total outcomes from vaccinations, or the increase or decrease in total infections in vaccinated individuals.

This is important because, although vaccinations in some cases may protect against the target disease, what else might they be doing not only on the short term, but in the long term? It’s also important to point out that in other cases, like the HPV vaccine, there is no evidence that they do protect against the target disease.

Another great example comes from a study published in 2017 that examined the introduction of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP) in an urban community in Guinea-Bissau in the early 1908s. They found that the DTP vaccine was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated. The authors state the following:

All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis. Though (this) vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.

This new study points out,

Pre-licensure clinical trials for vaccines cannot detect long-term outcomes since safety review periods following administration are typically 42 days or less. Long-term vaccine safety science relies on post-market surveillance studies using databases such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC’s) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink. VAERS is a passive reporting system in which, according to Ross 2011 , “fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.” The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) can, in principle, according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2013), be used to compare outcomes of vaccines and unvaccinated children. Based on the IOM’s recommendation, in 2016, the CDC published a white paper (CDC, 2016; Glanz et al., 2016) on studying the safety of their recommended pediatric vaccine schedule. Unfortunately, to date, no studies have been published comparing a diversity of outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated children.

Below is one of many interesting graphs from the study. The orange line represents the vaccinated children, and the blue one represents the unvaccinated.

For methods used, limitations, and more please refer to the study.

The parents that I work with in New York, that I see around the country are very concerned that their rights are being taken away, that their knowledge about the science is being pushed away by an agenda that only says, unvaccinated children are a problem. No study has every been done in this country, appropriately, to address the health outcomes of children who are vaccinated versus the children who are unvaccinated. I have been seeing families in my practice for over 20 years, that have opted out of vaccination, they are the healthiest children I’ve ever seen. – Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a NY licensed paediatrician

Why This Is Important: Given the fact that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) has paid out approximately $4 billion dollars to families of vaccine injured children, there are clearly, in my opinion, some valid points here, especially against compulsory vaccinations. Again, as mentioned above, VAERS only accounts for an estimated 1 percent of vaccine injuries, this one percent is what is recorded.

A 2010 HHS pilot study by the Federal Agency for Health Care Research (AHCR) found that 1 in every 39 vaccines causes injury, a shocking comparison to the claims from the CDC of 1 in every million.

Take the MMR vaccine for example, if you search on VAERS, as of 2/5/19, the cumulative raw count of adverse events from measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines alone was: 93,929 adverse events, 1,810 disabilities, 6,902 hospitalizations, and 463 deaths. Again, don’t forget about that 1% figure cited in the study.

There are a number of legitimate concerns about vaccine safety that would require quite a long and very in-depth article, but I just wanted to let the reader know here briefly. Aluminum for example, is another concern I’ve written quite a lot about.

These are a few reasons as to why vaccine hesitancy is at an all time high, even among many physicians and scientists. This has actually been observed for a while. For example, one study published in the journal EbioMedicine in 2013 outlines this point, stating in the introduction:

Over the past two decades several vaccine controversies have emerged in various countries, including France, inducing worries about severe adverse effects and eroding confidence in health authorities, experts and science. These two dimensions are at the core of vaccine hesitancy (VH) observed in the general population. VH is defined as delay in acceptance of vaccination, or refusal, or even acceptance with doubts about its safety and benefits, with all these behaviours and attitudes varying according to context , vaccine and personal profile, despite the availability of vaccine services VH presents a challenge to physicians who must address their patients’ concerns about vaccines and ensure satisfactory vaccination coverage.

At a 2019 conference on vaccines put on by the World Health Organization this fact was emphasized by Professor Heidi Larson, a Professor of Anthropology and the Risk and Decision Scientist Director at the Vaccine Confidence Project. She is referenced, as you can see, by the authors in the study above. At the conference, she emphasized that safety concerns among people and health professionals seem to be the biggest issue regarding vaccine hesitancy.

She also stated,

The other thing that’s a trend, and an issue, is not just confidence in providers but confidence of health care providers, we have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines. That’s a huge problem, because to this day any study I’ve seen… still, the most trusted person on any study I’ve seen globally is the health care provider…

Is there not enough information here alone to warrant informed consent? I have a hard time understanding how someone who would take the new COVID-19 vaccine, for example, would be worried about me contracting the virus if they are protected?

Why have we given governments the ability to mandate such actions? Why have we given them so much power to dictate what we do and how we want to live? Is this really how we want to live, is this really the kind of world we want to create?

A Deeper Discussion. What Do We Do About The Increasing Vaccine Pressure?

So many are concerned about mandatory vaccination. Further, many are starting to see that mandated vaccines may not be the future, but that services and options will be denied unless you can prove you have been vaccinated. Is it still the time to point the blame? Or is there a radical new approach we must take? A shift in our worldview, re-examining who we think we are, why we are here and what world we want to create is where we will begin to find the answers we are looking for. Has the dualistic fight the enemy method worked in the past? Are we not still here regardless of having used this method in the past? Maybe it’s time for a new conversation, one that looks at ourselves in a whole new light. This perhaps is how we will solve our ongoing challenges at their core.

1140,"""While most Americans sat glued to televisions and electronic devices on the evening of November 8, a blistering firefight between U.S. Marines devoted to restoring order to the Republic and federal agents loyal to the criminal Biden regime took place at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington D.C., with the Marines suffering a crushing defeat, Real Raw News can now report.

Although RRN takes no pleasure in highlighting White Hat losses, we have an obligation to report them, just as we do their triumphs.

On the morning of November 8, General David H. Berger greenlit an operation to seize control of the Federal Reserve after learning that the criminal Biden regime was in the process of buttressing the building’s security with a 10’ tall perimeter wall to prevent the outside world from discovering that the criminals within were minting billions and billions of dollars—fiat currency unbacked by gold—meant to reach the hands of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Sources in Gen. Berger’s office told RRN that the general spoke to both President Trump and Trump’s advisors before committing to the raid. The consensus, he added, was that the Fed would be dark and mostly empty due to it being Election Day, with only a small contingent of treasury agents guarding the 6-story, steel beam structure.

General Berger, sources added, handpicked two Marine Scout-Sniper platoons comprised of 24 men to fulfill the mission, the objectives of which included surveilling the building, eliminating or subduing opposition, and destroying the engraving & printing machines. The Marines arrived at the Fed at about 1:00 am an exploited a gap in the wall that was still under construction. While snipers provided overwatch, the other Marines stealthily approached the front doors—then all hell broke loose.

The doors flung open, and treasury agents equipped with NVGs and armed with automatic rifles unleashed a phalanx of bullets at the Marines, striking and killing four Marines as they tried to rush the doors. The Marine snipers returned fire and downed three treasury agents, while the Marines in the courtyard dove for cover and fired into the doorway with their own M27 rifles. Three more Marines were struck down as they moved to flank the doors, and then IRS snipers appeared in the windows of the upper level, taking potshots in the general direction of the Marine sniper squads. One IRS sniper took a headshot and was felled, but the Marines quickly realized they were outmanned and outgunned as floodlamps illuminated the exterior and a voice echoed, “You’ve walked into a trap and are covered from an elevated position. Drop your weapons and surrender. We have you outnumbered 20 to 1.”

The Marines began a tactical retreat, laying down suppressive fire as they withdrew two-by-two through the gap in the wall from whence they came. The Marine snipers plunked at the windows and doorway while the men on the ground evaded a hailstorm of gunfire. Another Marine was wounded during the egress, and the remaining Marines escaped unharmed.

“This was a loss,” a source in Gen. Berger’s office later told Real Raw News. “They obviously knew we were coming; we don’t know how. That place is printing money hand over fist and sending it overseas. We meant to stop it. Matters are worse now, but we’ll find a way.”

The researchers used a machine learning algorithm to assess data from patients' brain scans and sort them into groups, identifying two clusters with distinctive characteristics related to patient recovery likelihood. A second algorithm accurately predicted patient conditions nine months following initial diagnosis using the biologically based clusters. Patients with higher volumes of grey matter in their brain scans may have lower levels of inflammation and better cognitive function.

1160,"""Opposing opinions are not applicable as this is a factual statement. Findings recently published in Cell Reports shed light on the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) after hormonal therapies. According to lead researcher Associate Professor Luke Selth from the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute, certain tumors display increased cellular plasticity in response to new or stressful conditions, such as cancer therapy. This plasticity allows cancer cells to adapt and continue to grow by evolving into different cell types that no longer respond to therapy. Associate Professor Selth emphasizes that increased cellular plasticity is a significant feature that contributes to cancer resistance and progression. The study reveals that the microRNA 'miR-194' molecule enhances plasticity, leading to NEPC. Targeting miR-194 effectively slows down and inhibits the growth of prostate cancer models with neuroendocrine features. While the study is far from clinical application, it offers vital insights into how prostate cancers evolve in response to therapy. NEPC is an aggressive subtype of prostate cancer with no effective treatments. The study's co-author hopes that their research will lead to smarter, more targeted ways to treat or prevent the emergence of NEPC.

1234,"""Cancer of the womb (uterine or endometrial cancer) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. It's more common in women who have been through the menopause.

Symptoms of womb cancer The most common symptom of womb cancer is vaginal bleeding that is unusual for you (abnormal). If you've been through the menopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, abnormal bleeding may include very heavy periods or bleeding between your periods. Read more about the symptoms of womb cancer.

When to see a GP See your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and offer an internal examination. They will refer you to a specialist if necessary for further tests to rule out any serious problem. Read more about diagnosing womb cancer.

Types of womb cancer Most womb cancers begin in the cells that make up the lining of the womb (the endometrium). This is why cancer of the womb is often called endometrial cancer. In rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscle wall of the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way. Read more about soft tissue sarcomas. Womb cancer is separate from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.

Why does womb cancer happen? It's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it. One of the main risk factors for womb cancer is higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body. A number of things can cause your oestrogen levels to be high, including obesity. There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. It's not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception. Read more about the causes of womb cancer.

Treating womb cancer The most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy). A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy are also sometimes given too. A type of hormone therapy (progestogen) may be used if you have not yet been through the menopause and would still like to have children. Even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life. Read more about treating womb cancer.""",1
1235,"""The Chief of a Clinic in Chemnitz, Germany committed suicide. In a letter found on the scene, he explains that he can no longer be part of the Genocide.

On Tuesday, Dr Thomas Jendges, Head of the Chemnitz Clinic, committed suicide by jumping from the top of the clinic’s building in Flemmingstrasse, Germany, according to Bild . He was 55 years old.

The Docteur died on the spot from his injuries. Jendges had only been appointed sole managing Director of the Chemnitz Clinic since October 1st 2021. Since April, he was acting as Managing Director of East Germany’s largest municipal hospital.

Sven Schulze explained on Tuesday afternoon, on the city’s website that, the Chemnitz Clinic, despite the tragic death of Dr. Thomas Jendges is still able to act. Schulze: “The expanded management team will be in charge of business in the coming days.”

“It is with great dismay that I have just learned of the tragic death of Dr. Thomas Jendges’ experience. Last night (Monday, ed) we talked at length about the difficult situation of the crown “, said the mayor of Chemnitz Sven Schulze (50, SPD) on Tuesday morning.

Reports of a letter that the deceased alledgly left behind are circulating. Jendges alledgly killed himself to set an example against the corona vaccinations. These are “bio-warfare agents”, so it says in the postings. He is also said to have described the vaccine in his letter as genocide and a crime against humanity”, according to Tag24.

According to Las repúblicas, In the lengthy farewell letter Dr. Thomas Jendges wrote before his suicide and demanded its publication, he is said to have harshly criticized the information policy of governments in dealing with the dangerousness of Covid vaccines. The constant lies and deceit to the patient and the vaccinated that the vaccines are supposedly harmless, he could no longer bear them, it is said in the letter.



He condemns vaccinating the population with experimental and lethal vaccines against Covid-19, which is in fact more of a biological warfare agent created and manipulated for that use, than for any other known utility. For Dr. Thomas Jendges a genocide and a crime against humanity is taking place, they report that he says the letter, according to the German press such as the Bild newspaper.



Because the mayor threatened to fire him if he no longer stayed in the submissive line imposed by government order and refused to vaccinate patients at the clinic, there were presumably no more options for Jendges. This director has not wanted to support a crime of the federal government, the state government and his faithful henchmen. So she considered that his suicide was the only way to oppose him.



These are some details of the farewell letter that are currently in circulation. Although Dr. Jendges has ordered that his entire suicide letter be published, according to the current state of knowledge of the mayor of Chemnitz, Sven Schulze of the SPD, who continues to prevent this publication. Numerous groups have formed in various forums demanding that Schulze abandon his blocking attitude and finally respect Jendges’ last wish.

Jendges leaves behind a wife and a son.

When I was a child I was always interested in strange and unusual subjects. I was extremely interested in dinosaurs as I’m sure most kids are. When I was 9 years old the story of the Lake Worth Monster hit the front page of the Ft. Worth Star Telegram. My grandparents had a cabin cruiser boat on Eagle Mountain Lake which was separated by a dam from Lake Worth. I had spent many a night on that boat anchored out in the middle of Eagle Mountain Lake. As you can guess, the many scenarios involving the creature ran through my head. The story died down in November of 1969. The next year I obtained a copy of John A. Keel’s book Strange Creatures from Time & Space. It was very influential to me. Of course, like most people interested in Bigfoot, I saw the movie The Legend of Boggy Creek. I saw it in the theater and it made me think about the possibility that Bigfoot was closer to me than I had previously thought.



After seeing that movie, Bigfoot was something I thought about when I was in the out of doors. On Boy Scout campouts, walking through the woods at night and just being in wooded areas, I thought about encountering Bigfoot. Then I became an adult and had to go to work. Bigfoot slipped from my thoughts. Working, getting married, regular adult activities took priority. Unbeknownst to me, one of the more popular nicknames I picked up along the way, Wooly Booger, is a fairly popular name for Bigfoot here in the South.

Then one night in May of 1994, my reality came crashing down. I had a sighting of what I believe was a Bigfoot creature. It occurred while driving back to Dallas from New Orleans on May 30, 1994. We were about 175 miles Northwest of New Orleans on an unlit 2 lane highway approaching Alexandria, LA. There wasn’t a moon out and it was very dark. We were traveling at approximately 75 mph and it was approximately midnight. There was no shoulder to the road and it dipped down into a small ditch on either side of the road. It was about 25 to 30 feet to the wood line from the road. About halfway to the wood line, a figure was visible in the illumination of my headlights. It appeared to be about 7 foot tall, hairy and looked to be gray. Its back was towards us and it was walking in the direction we were traveling, parallel to the road. My wife, then girlfriend, and I looked at each other and simultaneously said “Did you just see what I saw?”. I wanted to stop and go back, but she did not. I was driving an Isuzu Amigo with the soft top rolled up, so I could see why she wasn’t in favor of this. It did become a topic of long discussion for the remainder of the trip. It was something that we talked amongst ourselves, but not with others.



Like I said, I was curious about these kinds of things since childhood. I made a point to watch any documentaries about anything that was unexplained like UFOs and Cryptozoology in general. When I got on the Internet in 1997, I started looking up websites that dealt with this subject matter. I started buying books on eBay about Bigfoot & Cryptozoology. I searched long and hard to find a copy of John Keel’s book that had such an impact on me in my youth. In early 1999, I came across a post on a message board asking if there was anyone in North Texas that was interested in researching Bigfoot. I jumped at the opportunity. We formed the Texas Bigfoot Research Center in June of 1999. The rest as they say is history.

In January, 2007, the TBRC reorganized as a 501(c)(3), non-profit, scientific research organization. The organization’s name was the Texas Bigfoot Research Conservancy. In March 2013, the organization has adopted the name North American Wood Ape Conservancy (NAWAC).

I resigned from the organization on July 10, 2010 to focus my attention on other endeavors, such as Cryptomundo.

As of December 24, 2013, I have resurrected the original TBRC, the Texas Bigfoot Research Center.

I have appeared in or contributed to the following TV programs, documentaries and films:

Scientists previously suspected smoking triggered DNA mutations in healthy cells, but were unable to identify mutations in healthy cells that predicted cancer risk. The researchers used single-cell whole genome sequencing to examine lung cells from 19 smokers and 14 nonsmokers and found that smoking did increase lung cancer risk by increasing the frequency of mutations. However, the number of mutations detected in smokers did not continue to increase after 23 pack-years of smoking, suggesting some people’s genes might make them more likely to fight mutations.",1

Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s administration have been seeking justice for historical crimes committed by Hungarian Nazi collaborators and Soros is understood to have been using his vast resources to “hide in plain sight” for decades.

Prime Minister Orban has been warning about Soros’ corrosive influence on society for decades. “Europe must not succumb to the Soros network,” wrote Orbán recently.

Soros was born to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930, and survived the Holocaust by collaborating with the Nazis. He has expressed a total lack of remorse for his actions, telling 60 Minutes in 1988 that if he didn’t do it, somebody else would have anyway.

Soros was been missing since at least March 5, shortly after news leaked about the impending charges. He was expected to attend a conference on his recent work on African education however he did not arrive.

The prosecution considers Soros fit to stand trial despite his advanced age, the prosecutor’s office said, however the case will be on hold until he is arrested.

Soros founded the Open Society Foundation in 1993 to help promote far-left values and open borders around the world. Laura Silber, a spokesperson for the foundation, told USA TODAY that the claim Soros aided and abetted Nazis is “100% false.”

US-based fact checkers have regularly defended Soros from claims that he was a Nazi during his teenage years. However, these same fact checkers are funded in part or wholly by Soros and they have failed to identify this conflict of interest while reporting on Soros.""",1

Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a giant scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”

According to Gates, who was speaking to an audience of his inner circle in 2018, wind, solar, battery technology and other renewable energy sources might be fashionable, but they are NOT capable of solving climate change.

As you can see in the video footage, the fact that renewable energy is not actually capable of solving climate change, despite being sold to us as the cure for so-called man made global warming, is hysterically funny for Bill Gates.

Why does he find it so funny? Perhaps because he is making a fortune out of these so-called “clean energy” sources and capitalizing on the gullible masses with their “screwed up minds.”

Damning stuff from the father of clean energy himself.

So now that we have Gates on record admitting clean energy is a scam, how does the unelected world health czar defend his plans to force people to stop eating meat and start consuming his fake meat?

As Joe Rogan pointed out, Bill Gates really shouldn’t be lecturing anyone about a healthy diet.

There is of course a clear financial motive to Gates’s plan in getting people to consume his fake food, just as there had been with his Covid “investments�?. This is the man who admitted he ordered President Trump not to investigate the possible side-effects of the new Covid vaccinations.

Damning stuff, I’m sure you will agree. But Gates has a history of being – suspiciously – one step ahead of major world disasters. And capitalizing on them when they arrive.

In recent years Gates has been buying up vast swathes of US and world farmland. Last year Gates became the biggest private owner of farmland in the US.

The Microsoft co-founder is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, according to last year’s edition of the Land Report 100, an annual survey of the nation’s largest landowners.

Suspiciously, following Gates’ quickfire purchase of the largest stake of America’s farmland, food production facilities started burning to the ground. Could the man who “predicted” the pandemic, and was conveniently on hand to capitalize from it, have also “predicted” the food crisis?

If you have been paying attention this year, you will know that the Netherlands has been the World Economic Forum’s experimental territory, where brutal Great Reset policies have been rolled out by a fully bought-and-paid-for government working on behalf of the WEF.

Considering the amount of pain and suffering that the Great Reset “clean energy” policies inflict on ordinary people, can they really be justified by the elite who are pushing them on us?

When you remember that four years ago Bill Gates was laughing with his friends about how “clean energy” won’t even solve the so-called climate crisis, there can only be one possible answer.

The Great Reset is a scam, no matter how you slice it.

Doctor Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the member of the Coro Irish Task Force, a traitor to the United States of America, according to Washington, sources familiar with this issue, These are sources within the highest levels of government some of them working in the United States Justice Department Department some some of of them them within within the. the White House. It's. The indictment, which currently is sitting on the Resolute desk at the Oval Office charges doctor Anthony Fauci with numerous high crimes and misdemeanors, many of which according to Judy Barrington, could see Fuchs stripped of his medical license and deported to Guantanamo Bay for the rest of his natural life if he is convicted of these crimes, These These charges charges charges reportedly reportedly reportedly include include. include. treason. Conspiring with the enemy and fraud Article two section four, the United States Constitution States quote the President, vice President and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. while Fuchs is neither a politician nor a government official. According to these sources, he is a career civil servant and therefore can be. Charged with criminal malfeasance as is outlined in Article two section four sources close to the ouchy probes that Trump became suspicious of fo's intentions after reading tweets linking the doctor to a deep state who designed to cripple his reelection campaign. These tweets alleged Pule and another none other than former President Barack Hussein Obama. Had orchestrated a hoax to take the economy spelling doom for a President who's main presidential achievement was fostering an economic resurgence here in the United States of America. Now these tweets summarize the Corona virus is a pretext for stripping Americans of the rights and freedoms that they hold dear and that he wants to usher in a new world order that would abolish the the the United United United States States States Constitution Constitution. Constitution and. and replace US. With United Nations personnel Fal behavior at Corona's press briefings further apparently fueled Trump's suspicions now back on March the twentieth, according to again doctor Judy Barrington, Trump called the State Department, The Deep State Department that was not a slip of the tongue standing behind him and thought he made a dismissive. You may remember this hand gesture drop his head and rubbed his forehead. Trump took it as a. Personal slight Trump doesn't forgive or forget, According to Benton, he had his Zion Andy's actions help confirm the President's suspicions, according to this source. Moreover, Fati has been a frequent guest on CNN and MSNBC networks that often criticized the President's handling of the Corona virus pandemic he has used his status as as one one of of America's America's America's most most most notable notable notable. notable physicians physicians physicians physicians. Fouch Fouch Fouch she has to directly directly contradict. contradict Trump's message. According to this indictment, the tweets combined with fountains radical contact prompted President Trump to direct the Justice Department to investigate the fountain Obama connection. We are also learning that one of the reasons Barack Obama was not invited to the White House for the unveiling of his portrait specifically has to do with the deep state connections to not only the investigation into Trump's campaign and the deep state involvement in the setup for the Russia collusion and General Michael Flynn's. indictment for perjury, but also this connection to Doctor Fal investigators learned and apparently leaked data proving that in 2015, Obama instructed faculty to authorize a three point Seven million dollar donation to a Wuhan Biology Lab, Fox News and the Washington Post have run articles questioning whether Covid-, 19 originated at the Wuhan facility Or perhaps. The United States and for Dietrich, Maryland, as we hear A- two concealed reported, then illegally transported the virus to the laboratory and Mohan China, or it may have been further weaponized. Additionally, a wiretap on Fuchs phone and electronic devices has revealed that the doctor and the disgraced former President have kept a close friendship, intercepted telephone calls and emails show that Obama Andi had conspired to undermine trump's. By having to give the President Unsound medical advice in matters involving this pandemic, according to this indictment first thought he told Trump the virus was quote unquote nothing to worry about. then he reversed course and warned Trump the Culver, 19 with utterly ravaged the United States of America unless martial law type steps were and once taken the curve the spread alright. So that's. Where we're standing at this point with that now think about this folks, this is very important. This guy is giving Trump all kinds of of advice again doctor doctor Fal Fal has has has been been been indicted indicted indicted. indicted. and and he's been a frequent guest on on CNN CNN and and and MSNBC.

You might remember this two rounds struck the chest collapsing both of his lungs because he had been having breathing difficulty due to the gunshot and was put on a ventilator prior to dying two hours later hospital staff diagnosed the cause of death as Covid- 19 any respiratory.

Also as covid- 19 the next day, New-york added over 3000 preemptive positive to the the state's state's growing growing some of covid- 19 fatalities Trump's investigative team on Earth. A trove of evidence allegedly proving that Doctor Fuchs compel the state to blame all in exact deaths since January on the Corona virus in doing so they have amplified the discount. The more Corona virus deaths. obviously the worst Trump appears in his reelection bid and the tighter restrictions get even more tighter as States continue to impose lockdowns. Now, those lockdowns are currently being lifted in many States, but in some of the more draconian States, mostly. By Democrats such as the state of Michigan with that with Gretchen Whitmer this is all being used as an excuse to keep the economy closed so that the Democrats can blame Trump for a poor economy and for poor reaction to the covid- 19 outbreak if all of the information is correct, Trump's specials. Secretly indicted charging the deep state actor with crimes under the Patriot Act and the 1917 Espionage Act now as of this point because of what is all going on and because this is still being kept under the radar. Trump has not fired Doctor Fal who's faced at least among the American public at this point is synonymous with trustworthiness as well as honesty and integrity, according to Judy Bidi. As the pandemic continues to spread so did fo's popularity and it's important that the daily press briefings that eclipsed the front man such as Trump and Pence, a sources said. Trump will not prematurely Firefox you because doing so might backfire and caused him the 2020 election. so this indictment may not end up being unsealed until after the 2020 presidential election. and of course, he's not gonna quit because he. Is hoping to work out some sort of a plea bargain agreement from Barrington is being told and plea bargain his way out of a life sentence at Gitmo. the source of Vinton is quoting, said although the formal accusation is sealed thought she knows that the gig is up, they have revoked his passport and after Trump wins the election and after the pandemic has run, it's course. according to her sources, the indictment will be open. And Doctor Foxx, you will face a military tribunal to answer for his crimes against Americas. so that is the story that we are bringing to you right now an unsealed as of yet indictment against Doctor Anthony Fauci.

 Our maternal grandmothers are unique in that they have a special connection with us, their grandchildren. They play an important role in our lives, both on an emotional and on a genetic level. Even if you don't spend much time with your maternal grandmother, the bond between you and her will never fade away. It happens because you inherit her DNA, her temperament, her tastes, and her emotions! 
 Bright Side dug deeper into this topic to understand what actually bonds us to our maternal grandmothers. Let's have a look at what we found! 
 Alejandro Jodorowsky, a Chilean essayist, has written a book called Metagenealogy: Self-Discovery Through Psychomagic and the Family Tree, where he explains the genetic influence of maternal grandmothers on their grandchildren, because genes can skip generations passing from a grandparent directly to the grandchild. 
 According to Alejandro, the genes that children receive in their mothers' wombs come directly from their grandmothers. Among all the grandparents and relatives, the maternal grandmother is the one who is the most responsible for gene inheritance.

The availability of the cyclotron allows Mayo Clinic to offer patients access to short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, like Choline C-11, which provides the earliest FDA-approved imaging detection of prostate cancer possible. Cyclotrons produce various radioactive isotopes, which are then injected into patients undergoing PET scans. Clinicians use a PET scanner and computer to make detailed pictures of areas where the radioactive agent collects, and the pictures identify areas of possible cancer in the body. Choline C-11 is available at Mayo Clinic's Phoenix and Rochester campuses only. The use of cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals is expected to increase as medicine becomes more individualized, and the cyclotron enables Mayo Clinic to produce three isotopes (F-18, C-11, and N-13) that make various imaging agents for research.",1

The study highlights the seriousness of long COVID, which was previously considered rare and not causing much harm. The CDC researchers looked at death certificates and medical records to identify 3,544 Americans who died from long COVID between Jan. 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022. However, healthcare professionals believe that this number is likely an underestimate. Less than half of the deaths linked to long COVID, 43%, occurred in people aged 75 and younger, with men accounting for 51.5% of long COVID deaths. Furthermore, 79% of long COVID deaths were non-Hispanic white people, followed by 10% non-Hispanic Black people and about 8% Hispanic people. The study proposes that many COVID-19 patients in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic groups likely died from their original disease before they could develop long COVID.

A: Have a miscarriage,

B: Abort spontaneously,

C. Poison a baby through her breast milk,

D: Have babies with cognitive problems (memory and concentration problems).

Anonymouswire.com reports: This is universal, and very bad. Here is a small part of the text:

8.3.5.3. Occupational exposure

“Occupational exposure occurs when a person has unplanned direct contact with a subject for a vaccine, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event. These individuals may include caregivers, relatives, and other people close to the subject.

When such exposures occur, the investigator must report this to Pfizer saftey within 24 hours of being notified, whether or not an associated secondary adverse event occurs. This must be reported using the vaccine secondary adverse event reporting form. SINCE THE INFORMATION DOES NOT RELATE TO ANY PARTICIPANT IN THE STUDY, THE INFORMATION WILL BE KEPT SEPARATE FROM THE STUDY”.

To make it clear: participants in vaccine studies become superspreaders of something, they don’t say what it is, but it causes secondary adverse events in people who have never had the ‘vaccine’ when exposed to people who have had the ‘vaccine’. have had.

THIS IS SO BAD that here, in this little bit of quoted text, it is warned that unvaccinated men exposed to a woman who has had the vaccine will pass what is in the vaccine to another woman.

Even the relatively small portion of the document presented below states that the vaccine causes spontaneous abortions and reproductive problems when unvaccinated individuals are exposed to vaccinated individuals and that breast milk from a vaccinated mother can be harmful to the infant. And if anyone doesn’t believe that, click the link above and wade through that huge and intentionally confusing document. It’s true folks, the vaccine is indeed the killer syringe.

Don’t let the vaccinated come near you, it’s official now.

Here’s a small portion of this huge document, straight from Pfizer:

Terms

Study Intervention – A Vaccine Subject.

AE – Adverse event in someone who has received the vaccine.

SAE: An adverse event in someone who has been exposed to someone who has received the vaccine.

EDP: Exposure during pregnancy.

8.3.5. Exposure to the study intervention under investigation during pregnancy or lactation and occupational exposures must be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of becoming aware of the investigator.

8.3.5.1. Exposure during pregnancy – EDP is present if:

* A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving a study intervention or after she has stopped taking it.

* A male participant undergoing or having discontinued a study intervention is exposed to a female partner before or around the time of conception.

* A woman is found to be pregnant while exposed or has been exposed to a research intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of exposure to the study environment during pregnancy:

* A female relative or caregiver reports that she is pregnant after exposure to the study intervention through inhalation or skin contact.

* A male relative or caregiver exposed to the study intervention through inhalation or skin contact then exposes their female partner prior to or around the time of conception.

†

If this vaccination is not passed on to other people, why should contact between vaccinated and unvaccinated be a noteworthy event? If this vaccination is not transmitted, WHY should a man who has been around a vaccinated woman, even if he has not touched her or had sex, be concerned about getting another woman pregnant?

That’s not all, the following is detailed and much worse.

The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of it, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. The first information submitted must include the expected date of delivery (see below for information regarding the termination of pregnancy).

* If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Report Form and the EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not relate to the participant in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form will be kept on file at the investigator’s site. Follow-up is performed to obtain general information about the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator follows the pregnancy until completion (or until the pregnancy is terminated) and notifies Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the original EDP supplement form. In the case of live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the case of abortion, the reason(s) for the abortion should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the aborted fetus should be assessed by visual examination (unless the findings of the examination precede demonstrate a congenital anomaly to the procedure and the findings are reported). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal death, or congenital malformation), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

* Spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion;

* Neonatal deaths occurring within 1 month of birth, regardless of causality, should be reported as SAEs. In addition, infant mortality at 1 month should be reported as SAE when the investigator believes that infant death is or may be related to exposure to the study intervention. The client may request additional information about the PBT. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be addressed on a case-by-case basis (eg follow-up of preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of father exposure, the researcher will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Information Disclosure Form to give to his partner.

8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding – Exposure during breastfeeding occurs if:

* A female participant was found to be breastfeeding during or after discontinuation of the study intervention.

* A woman has been found to be breastfeeding while exposed or exposed to a research intervention (ie exposure to the environment). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female relative or caregiver reporting that she is breastfeeding after being exposed to the study intervention through inhalation or skin contact. The investigator must report exposure during lactation to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of becoming aware of it, whether or not an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Report Form. If exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not relate to the participant enrolled in the study and thus the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form will be kept in the investigator’s file. No report of exposure during breastfeeding is created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accordance with its approved use. However, if the infant develops an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE will be reported along with the exposure during lactation. However, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form will be kept in the investigator’s file. No report of exposure during breastfeeding is created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accordance with its approved use. However, if the infant develops an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE will be reported along with the exposure during lactation. However, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form will be kept in the investigator’s file. No report of exposure during breastfeeding is created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accordance with its approved use. However, if the infant develops an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE will be reported along with the exposure during lactation.

Here is the clear part, which everyone can understand:

8.3.5.3. Occupational exposure – Occupational exposure occurs when a person comes into unplanned direct contact with the study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. Such individuals may include caregivers, relatives, or other individuals involved in the care of the study participant. The investigator must report occupational exposures to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge, regardless of whether an associated SAE occurs. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Report Form. Since the information does not relate to a participant participating in the study, the information is not recorded in a CRF;

Occupational exposure occurs when a person has unplanned direct contact with a vaccine subject, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event. These people may be caregivers, family members, and other people close to the subject.

When such exposures occur, the investigator must report this to Pfizer Saftey within 24 hours of being notified, whether or not an associated secondary adverse event occurs. This must be reported using the vaccine secondary adverse event reporting form. SINCE THE INFORMATION DOES NOT RELATE TO ANY PARTICIPANT INVOLVED IN THE STUDY, THE INFORMATION WILL BE KINDED SEPARATELY FROM THE STUDY.

1438,"""Japan announces that public and private sectors can not discriminate against those who refuse the experimental mRNA gene therapy injections.

Japan is now labeling Covid “vaccines” to warn of dangerous and potentially deadly side effects such as myocarditis. In addition, the country is reaffirming its commitment to adverse event reporting requirements to ensure all possible side effects are documented.

These efforts from Japan’s health authority are in stark contrast to the deceptive measures taken by other countries to coerce citizens into taking the injection, downplaying side effects, and discouraging proper adverse event reporting.

Additionally, Japan is emphasizing informed consent and bodily autonomy. Until the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of “informed consent” was considered sacred to healthcare professionals in the West.

Japan is particularly raising concerns about the risks of myocarditis in young men injected with Pfizer or Moderna’s gene–therapy treatment. The country is enforcing a strict legal reporting requirement of side effects that must take place within 28 days of the injections.

Novel Additives: Descriptions Clarify

Three Covid-19 gene-therapy treatments are currently offered in Japan. They include the Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) and Takeda’s Moderna formulation. The product descriptions (here and here) state that “this product contains an additive that has never been used in a vaccine before.”

Furthermore, the pharmaceutical companies urge you to consult your doctor about the additive if you plan to be injected with it. In addition to the Pfizer and Moderna gene-therapies, Vaxzevria (formerly AstraZeneca) is also administered in Japan. However, Japan only recommends it to people 40-year-old and over. Reference is also made to the new type of additive in the Vaxzevria injections.

No Compulsory Vaccination Or Discrimination

Japan’s Ministry of Health of health website encourages citizens to receive the “vaccine”; however, they stress it is not mandatory,

Although we encourage all citizens to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, it is not compulsory or mandatory. Vaccination will be given only with the consent of the person to be vaccinated after the information provided.

In addition, the government recommends those who are considering taking the shot carefully consider both its effectiveness and side effects.

Please get vaccinated of your own decision, understanding both the effectiveness in preventing infectious diseases and the risk of side effects. No vaccination will be given without consent.

Furthermore, they stress that businesses do not force employees to receive the experimental gene therapy. Nor should employees discriminate against those who refuse the injections,

Please do not force anyone in your workplace or those who around you to be vaccinated, and do not discriminate against those who have not been vaccinated.

The government even links to a “Human Rights Advice,” including instructions for handling any complaints if individuals face “vaccine” discrimination at work.

Japan Breaks Ranks

Doctors worldwide have echoed Japan’s health authority warnings about the gene-therapies side effects. However, this kind of proper informed consent has cost many doctors in western nations their licenses to practice medicine. The government has accused these doctors of spreading ‘vaccine hesitancy.’

Furthermore, while Japan allows its citizens to choose whether to be injected with the experimental gene-therapies, other countries are forcing citizens to receive the jab. For example, in February 2022, Austria will mandate the injections. Citizens who refuse will face heavy fines and up to one year in prison.

The goal of hospice care is to optimize a patient's quality of life and reduce their suffering for however long they have to live, and it is intended to hasten a person's death. Hospice care is specifically for patients who have a serious illness and have a prognosis of six months or less, and physicians make the determination of life expectancy based on the disease running its normal course. While patients no longer receive active therapies for their underlying condition while they are in hospice, this is still a medical intervention, and medications should not be used aggressively to manage patients' symptoms. Medicare began covering hospice care in 1983, and it includes basic palliative care. Hospice services are sometimes provided in nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, hospice facilities, and hospitals, but they can also be provided in a patient's home with the support of a hospice team, which includes a nurse case manager, physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, volunteers, and others. Before a patient can receive hospice care, they must be certified as terminally ill by a hospice doctor and their regular doctor, accept comfort care instead of treatments to cure their illness, and sign a statement choosing hospice care. Hospice care and palliative care are similar in that they aim to manage symptoms and relieve suffering, but they differ in the timing of supportive care and the patient's goals. Palliative care can be given to patients who are not necessarily terminally ill and who continue to receive treatment, while hospice care is specifically for those with a prognosis of six months or less and who have stopped receiving treatment.

Due to the significant impact to the business, Kohl’s is taking additional actions to strengthen its financial flexibility during this time.



“These are unprecedented times as our communities around the country come together to support the nationwide efforts in slowing the spread of COVID-19. At Kohl’s we are committed to doing our part as we extend the duration of our store closures to protect the health and safety of our customers and our associates,” said Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive officer. “As a company, we operate with great discipline to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are taking difficult and decisive actions to strengthen our financial liquidity and secure the financial position of the company for the long-term benefit of our associates, customers and shareholders.”



Kohl’s Associates

As previously announced, Kohl’s provided two calendar weeks of pay to all store and store distribution center associates. Given that the company will be extending the duration of our store closures until further notice, Kohl’s will temporarily furlough store and store distribution center associates, as well as some corporate office associates whose work has been significantly reduced by the store closures.



The company will continue to provide existing health benefits to furloughed associates at this time, and those impacted may benefit from the recently passed coronavirus stimulus legislation.



As the company manages through this crisis, Kohl’s chief executive officer, Michelle Gass will not take a salary.



“It is an incredibly difficult decision to extend our store closures and temporarily furlough some of our associates,” said Gass. “We look forward to the day that we can reopen our stores to welcome our associates back and serve the millions of families across the country that shop Kohl’s.”



Business Actions

As part of the COVID-19 response, the company is taking the following actions to preserve financial liquidity and financial flexibility:



Decreasing capital expenditures by approximately $500 million,

Managing inventory meaningfully lower to align with anticipated sales,

Significantly reducing expenses across the business including marketing, technology and operations while stores remain closed,

Temporarily suspending share repurchases and evaluating its dividend program, and

Fully drawing down its $1 billion revolving credit facility.



Kohl’s Customers

Kohl’s continues to serve millions of customers through Kohls.com and the Kohl’s App. In addition to ship to home, beginning on April 2, Kohl’s customers can now shop on Kohls.com and opt to pick up their items at most Kohl’s stores between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. local time. Kohl’s will offer this new convenience for customers who prefer to pick up their online orders at their local Kohl’s store for free and within two hours of placing their orders.



Kohl’s will provide further updates, including news on store reopenings, at Corporate.Kohls.com.

1512,"""For decades, Bernie Sanders has traveled the world, pursuing an unconventional approach to diplomacy. American politicians often visit other countries to project influence abroad and strengthen existing alliances. Foreign travel can also be leisurely, allowing elected officials to play tourist and spend time in luxury hotels. Of course, not everyone sticks to the same script. Sanders has charted a different course, traveling abroad to dissent against his own government, and critique the way America wields power on a global stage. He has risked controversy by extending an olive branch to left-leaning governments shunned by the American political establishment. Along the way, Sanders has demonstrated a deep interest in foreign policy, and a desire to shape the way the world views the United States.

As a member of Congress, Sanders has visited at least 41 countries, including Mexico, China, Israel, Vietnam, and South Africa, over the course of more than two dozen government-sponsored and privately-funded trips. His travels have taken him to the Middle East to visit a refugee camp in Jordan, discuss the Syrian conflict with diplomats in Turkey, and meet U.S. military officials in Afghanistan. Sanders has traveled to Central America to warn against the dangers of flawed trade policy, and spent a considerable amount of time visiting Nordic nations that he now holds up as models for America to emulate.

While serving as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders made foreign travel something of a priority, a rarity for an elected official involved in city government. He even set off on a trip to the Soviet Union after marrying his wife, Jane, in an effort to cement a sister-city relationship. (“Trust me. It was a very strange honeymoon,” Sanders wrote in his updated memoir Outsider In the White House.)

Throughout his travels, Sanders has articulated the idea that domestic and foreign priorities are inextricably linked. He has consistently railed against corporate power and advocated for workers’ rights, applying the same lens to foreign policy that he uses to diagnose many of the problems he sees in American society. That’s the picture that emerges from an examination of public travel records and media coverage of his trips; Sanders’s memoir; a partial list of countries he has visited provided by his Senate office; and Legistorm, a database that tracks privately financed congressional travel.

Ever the activist, Sanders has traveled abroad to voice opposition to American foreign policy and U.S. military intervention. As mayor of Burlington, Sanders was an outspoken opponent of president Ronald Reagan’s foreign policy and visited Nicaragua in 1985 to show support for the left-wing Sandinista government, a regime Reagan worked to undermine. Sanders met with Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega during the trip, which was intended as a political statement. Sanders explained that his aim was “to convey to the Nicaraguan people that, in my view, a majority of Americans do not believe it is appropriate for the United States to unilaterally overthrow governments which it dislikes,” according to Steven Soifer’s The Socialist Mayor: Bernard Sanders in Burlington, Vermont.

In expressing dissent, Sanders outlined a vision for U.S. conduct on the global stage, arguing that America is at its best when it engages with the rest of the world on an equal footing, and not on the basis of brute force. “We want our nation to be bold and brave, but not with guns, and not with machine guns, and not with Napalm,” Sanders said in a speech during his trip to Nicaragua. Instead, Sanders argued, America should “work out problems based on mutual respect” with other nations. The message signaled his concern with America’s image abroad. Sanders seemed determined to put forward an alternative to the foreign policy ideals envisioned by the U.S. political establishment, to show that he and like-minded Americans were sympathetic to the concerns of citizens of other countries who might mistrust American foreign policy and military intervention.

Sanders outlined a vision for U.S. conduct on the global stage, arguing that America is at its best when it engages with the rest of the world on an equal footing, and not on the basis of brute force.

Sanders hasn’t shied away from critiquing American policy even when it risks controversy and backlash. “Sanders’s trip to Nicaragua was a very bold move. Mainstream Vermont politicians did not quite know what to make of it,” Soifer wrote. In 2003, Sanders raised concerns over government surveillance and the Patriot Act during a trip to Toronto, Canada, at a time when many Americans were largely in favor of the law that stood at the heart of America’s war on terror. In 2011, Sanders called for an exit strategy for U.S. troops in Afghanistan after returning from a visit to the country, and suggested that military operations cost too much. “I think we can cut back,"" Sanders told a Vermont media outlet.

Far from shunning foreign policy in favor of a focus on domestic priorities, Sanders frequently expressed the belief that foreign and domestic policy are deeply intertwined. “I saw no magic line separating local, state, national, and international issues,” he explained in his memoir.

That idea underpinned Sanders’s efforts to strengthen ties between the U.S. and far-left governments that many Americans viewed with deep distrust. When asked to explain why he hoped to see a thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations before departing for his trip to the USSR in 1988, Sanders suggested that hostility between the two global powers had cost Americans dearly. “These people have been our ‘enemies,’ and in the name of that rivalry, we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars that in my view should be spent on health care and housing,” Sanders said, according to a report in The Boston Globe.

Sanders deployed similar logic to call for normalizing relations with Cuba in 2014 on the eve of a trip to the country. “American businesses are losing billions of dollars because of the economic embargo,” Sanders said. (That wasn’t the first time he had traveled to Cuba. In his memoir, he recalls a visit in 1989 where he hoped to meet with Fidel Castro, but had to settle for the mayor of Havana instead.)

Sanders hasn’t shied away from critiquing American policy even when it risks controversy and backlash.

While traveling abroad, Sanders engaged with global affairs through the lens of economic inequality. At times, he seemed to go out of his way to highlight what he saw as the pernicious impact of trade policy on American and foreign workers.

In 2003, Sanders traveled to Mexico on a trip sponsored by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a major labor union, to study the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a trade deal signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. After returning, Sanders penned a scathing critique of economic globalization for The Nation, describing how rural farmers “had been devastated” by competition with American corporations.

Sanders visited China the same year amid concern that a trade imbalance had disadvantaged American workers. He used the occasion to again take aim at American corporations. “Sanders said his message to U.S. business officials in China will be: ‘The American people are catching on that you are selling out American workers,’” the Gannett News Service reported ahead of the visit.

As he crisscrossed the globe, Sanders has shown an interest in learning from other societies’ experiments and successes. In 1994, he traveled with a U.S. delegation that included his now-presidential rival Hillary Clinton to see Nelson Mandela sworn in as president of South Africa. Sanders suggested that America would do well to find lessons in the country’s effort to remake itself as a Democratic society. ""What has happened in South Africa over the last three to four years really is in many ways a beacon of hope for people throughout the entire world,” Sanders said, according to an Associated Press report. “We have much to learn from their struggle,"" he added.

In the 1960s, Sanders volunteered at an Israeli kibbutz, a communal settlement where people typically live and work together. He has also traveled frequently to Nordic nations, notching three trips to Denmark in four years as well as visits to Norway and Iceland, a record that seems to align with his effusive praise for Scandinavia as a kind of left-leaning political utopia.

A review of Sanders’s foreign travel paints a picture of a politician with a set of remarkably consistent ideological convictions that have acted as a driving force for both his domestic and foreign policy agenda. Even as he has engaged with the rest of the world, he has remained unafraid to criticize U.S. policies he felt were flawed. As Sanders engages anew with foreign-policy debates in the midst of his presidential run, he’ll be drawing on these experiences that gave shape to his views on America’s role in the world.""",1

Myriam Bourla – the wife of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla – has died from complications from the COVID-19 vaccine early Wednesday, according to her doctor. She passed away in the emergency room at New York-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital after being brought in by paramedics. The cause of death has been listed as complications from the Pfizer vaccine.

Myriam Bourla lived in the New York suburb of Scarsdale with her husband. Like many others, Bourla expressed skepticism with her husband’s experimental injection, originally refusing to take it. During an interview with Scarsdale 10583, Bourla stated that while she was “proud” of the work her husband did, she initially refused to take the vaccine, stating it was “not her turn, yet.”

“I just want to communicate that I’m very proud for my husband and the work he has done. I’m also very happy for the humanity and the hope that the vaccine brought to the world. I haven’t had the vaccine yet because is not my turn, yet.”

Many correctly pointed out that this statement demonstrated Bourla’s skepticism towards a vaccine that many believe wasn’t fully tested.

Legal trouble for Pfizer

Albert Bourla has been having a bad week, claiming on Tuesday that people that spread misinformation on vaccines are “criminals.” Critics were quick to point out how Pfizer was previously fined $2.3 billion for illegal marketing in an off-label drug case. One person asked, “didn’t Pfizer pay the largest fine in Big Pharma history for bribing doctors?”

In addition, Pfizer is being accused of lying to the public after a whistleblower raised questions around “data integrity and regulatory oversight” during Pfizer’s “vaccine” trials.

1635,"""On June 30, the mainstream media reported on the June 29 death of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who at 88 years old certainly had one foot in the grave and could have expired at any moment. His cause of death was listed as Multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in white blood cells and damages bones, kidneys, and the immune system. While he may have been gravely ill, cancer did not kill him.

Rather, he committed suicide at a military tribunal that held him responsible for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, who perished while hunting for imaginary WMDs, on Rumsfeld’s orders.

Specifics on how the military grabbed Rumsfeld are unknown, but RRN has learned he was arrested on May 27 and promptly flown to Diego Garcia, where the U.S. has a critical bomber base and, it turns out, facilities controlled by the U.S. Office of Military Commissions. RRN was slow to grab this news because the bulk of our tribunal content stems from trials at GITMO.

RRN has learned that the military also intended to question him about his involvement in 9/11 and the “coincidental” destruction of Cantor Fitzgerald, a brokerage firm that did business with the U.S. Defense Dept. That firm’s servers, destroyed in the collapse along with 650 employees, were said to hold proof that Rumsfeld had misappropriated $2.3 trillion of defense department cash to fund his personal “black ops” programs. In fact, a day prior to 9/11, Rumsfeld admitted the Pentagon had inexplicably “lost” that dollar amount.

But the Office of Military Commissions never had a chance to present its evidence at trial, nor wheedle from Rumsfeld a confession.

Fifteen minutes into the proceedings, as the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps began reading an extensive list of charges, Rumsfeld winced as if in excruciating physical pain and then collapsed to the floor in a convulsive fit, sputtering and foaming at the mouth. Paramedics charged into the chamber, but their efforts to save him were in vain. Within minutes, Rumsfeld had perished.

A July 1 autopsy revealed that Rumsfeld’s reading glasses, which he had been allowed to wear at trial, had a microscopic needle concealed in the temple tip. The needle held a lethal dose of potassium cyanide. A military forensic pathology investigator said Rumsfeld must have innocuously removed his glasses and injected the poison in his tongue or cheek.

RRN will supply additional details if and when they arise.

Vaccination targeting migrating populations during this time of year could be very useful in interrupting the annual outbreak pattern.

I. The Growing Fear of Irrelevance

There is nothing inevitable about democracy. For all the success that democracies have had over the past century or more, they are blips in history. Monarchies, oligarchies, and other forms of authoritarian rule have been far more common modes of human governance.

The emergence of liberal democracies is associated with ideals of liberty and equality that may seem self-evident and irreversible. But these ideals are far more fragile than we believe. Their success in the 20th century depended on unique technological conditions that may prove ephemeral.

In the second decade of the 21st century, liberalism has begun to lose credibility. Questions about the ability of liberal democracy to provide for the middle class have grown louder; politics have grown more tribal; and in more and more countries, leaders are showing a penchant for demagoguery and autocracy. The causes of this political shift are complex, but they appear to be intertwined with current technological developments. The technology that favored democracy is changing, and as artificial intelligence develops, it might change further.

Information technology is continuing to leap forward; biotechnology is beginning to provide a window into our inner lives—our emotions, thoughts, and choices. Together, infotech and biotech will create unprecedented upheavals in human society, eroding human agency and, possibly, subverting human desires. Under such conditions, liberal democracy and free-market economics might become obsolete.

Ordinary people may not understand artificial intelligence and biotechnology in any detail, but they can sense that the future is passing them by. In 1938 the common man’s condition in the Soviet Union, Germany, or the United States may have been grim, but he was constantly told that he was the most important thing in the world, and that he was the future (provided, of course, that he was an “ordinary man,” rather than, say, a Jew or a woman). He looked at the propaganda posters—which typically depicted coal miners and steelworkers in heroic poses—and saw himself there: “I am in that poster! I am the hero of the future!”

In 2018 the common person feels increasingly irrelevant. Lots of mysterious terms are bandied about excitedly in ted Talks, at government think tanks, and at high-tech conferences—globalization, blockchain, genetic engineering, AI, machine learning—and common people, both men and women, may well suspect that none of these terms is about them.

In the 20th century, the masses revolted against exploitation and sought to translate their vital role in the economy into political power. Now the masses fear irrelevance, and they are frantic to use their remaining political power before it is too late. Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump may therefore demonstrate a trajectory opposite to that of traditional socialist revolutions. The Russian, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were made by people who were vital to the economy but lacked political power; in 2016, Trump and Brexit were supported by many people who still enjoyed political power but feared they were losing their economic worth. Perhaps in the 21st century, populist revolts will be staged not against an economic elite that exploits people but against an economic elite that does not need them anymore. This may well be a losing battle. It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation.

The revolutions in information technology and biotechnology are still in their infancy, and the extent to which they are responsible for the current crisis of liberalism is debatable. Most people in Birmingham, Istanbul, St. Petersburg, and Mumbai are only dimly aware, if they are aware at all, of the rise of AI and its potential impact on their lives. It is undoubtable, however, that the technological revolutions now gathering momentum will in the next few decades confront humankind with the hardest trials it has yet encountered.

II. A New Useless Class?

Let’s start with jobs and incomes, because whatever liberal democracy’s philosophical appeal, it has gained strength in no small part thanks to a practical advantage: The decentralized approach to decision making that is characteristic of liberalism—in both politics and economics—has allowed liberal democracies to outcompete other states, and to deliver rising affluence to their people.

Liberalism reconciled the proletariat with the bourgeoisie, the faithful with atheists, natives with immigrants, and Europeans with Asians by promising everybody a larger slice of the pie. With a constantly growing pie, that was possible. And the pie may well keep growing. However, economic growth may not solve social problems that are now being created by technological disruption, because such growth is increasingly predicated on the invention of more and more disruptive technologies.

Fears of machines pushing people out of the job market are, of course, nothing new, and in the past such fears proved to be unfounded. But artificial intelligence is different from the old machines. In the past, machines competed with humans mainly in manual skills. Now they are beginning to compete with us in cognitive skills. And we don’t know of any third kind of skill—beyond the manual and the cognitive—in which humans will always have an edge.

At least for a few more decades, human intelligence is likely to far exceed computer intelligence in numerous fields. Hence as computers take over more routine cognitive jobs, new creative jobs for humans will continue to appear. Many of these new jobs will probably depend on cooperation rather than competition between humans and AI. Human-AI teams will likely prove superior not just to humans, but also to computers working on their own.

However, most of the new jobs will presumably demand high levels of expertise and ingenuity, and therefore may not provide an answer to the problem of unemployed unskilled laborers, or workers employable only at extremely low wages. Moreover, as AI continues to improve, even jobs that demand high intelligence and creativity might gradually disappear. The world of chess serves as an example of where things might be heading. For several years after IBM’s computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997, human chess players still flourished; AI was used to train human prodigies, and teams composed of humans plus computers proved superior to computers playing alone.

Yet in recent years, computers have become so good at playing chess that their human collaborators have lost their value and might soon become entirely irrelevant. On December 6, 2017, another crucial milestone was reached when Google’s AlphaZero program defeated the Stockfish 8 program. Stockfish 8 had won a world computer chess championship in 2016. It had access to centuries of accumulated human experience in chess, as well as decades of computer experience. By contrast, AlphaZero had not been taught any chess strategies by its human creators—not even standard openings. Rather, it used the latest machine-learning principles to teach itself chess by playing against itself. Nevertheless, out of 100 games that the novice AlphaZero played against Stockfish 8, AlphaZero won 28 and tied 72—it didn’t lose once. Since AlphaZero had learned nothing from any human, many of its winning moves and strategies seemed unconventional to the human eye. They could be described as creative, if not downright genius.

Can you guess how long AlphaZero spent learning chess from scratch, preparing for the match against Stockfish 8, and developing its genius instincts? Four hours. For centuries, chess was considered one of the crowning glories of human intelligence. AlphaZero went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours, without the help of any human guide.

AlphaZero is not the only imaginative software out there. One of the ways to catch cheaters in chess tournaments today is to monitor the level of originality that players exhibit. If they play an exceptionally creative move, the judges will often suspect that it could not possibly be a human move—it must be a computer move. At least in chess, creativity is already considered to be the trademark of computers rather than humans! So if chess is our canary in the coal mine, we have been duly warned that the canary is dying. What is happening today to human-AI teams in chess might happen down the road to human-AI teams in policing, medicine, banking, and many other fields.

What’s more, AI enjoys uniquely nonhuman abilities, which makes the difference between AI and a human worker one of kind rather than merely of degree. Two particularly important nonhuman abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability.

For example, many drivers are unfamiliar with all the changing traffic regulations on the roads they drive, and they often violate them. In addition, since every driver is a singular entity, when two vehicles approach the same intersection, the drivers sometimes miscommunicate their intentions and collide. Self-driving cars, by contrast, will know all the traffic regulations and never disobey them on purpose, and they could all be connected to one another. When two such vehicles approach the same junction, they won’t really be two separate entities, but part of a single algorithm. The chances that they might miscommunicate and collide will therefore be far smaller.

Similarly, if the World Health Organization identifies a new disease, or if a laboratory produces a new medicine, it can’t immediately update all the human doctors in the world. Yet even if you had billions of AI doctors in the world—each monitoring the health of a single human being—you could still update all of them within a split second, and they could all communicate to one another their assessments of the new disease or medicine. These potential advantages of connectivity and updatability are so huge that at least in some lines of work, it might make sense to replace all humans with computers, even if individually some humans still do a better job than the machines.

The same technologies that might make billions of people economically irrelevant might also make them easier to monitor and control.

All of this leads to one very important conclusion: The automation revolution will not consist of a single watershed event, after which the job market will settle into some new equilibrium. Rather, it will be a cascade of ever bigger disruptions. Old jobs will disappear and new jobs will emerge, but the new jobs will also rapidly change and vanish. People will need to retrain and reinvent themselves not just once, but many times.

Just as in the 20th century governments established massive education systems for young people, in the 21st century they will need to establish massive reeducation systems for adults. But will that be enough? Change is always stressful, and the hectic world of the early 21st century has produced a global epidemic of stress. As job volatility increases, will people be able to cope? By 2050, a useless class might emerge, the result not only of a shortage of jobs or a lack of relevant education but also of insufficient mental stamina to continue learning new skills.

III. The Rise of Digital Dictatorships

As many people lose their economic value, they might also come to lose their political power. The same technologies that might make billions of people economically irrelevant might also make them easier to monitor and control.

AI frightens many people because they don’t trust it to remain obedient. Science fiction makes much of the possibility that computers or robots will develop consciousness—and shortly thereafter will try to kill all humans. But there is no particular reason to believe that AI will develop consciousness as it becomes more intelligent. We should instead fear AI because it will probably always obey its human masters, and never rebel. AI is a tool and a weapon unlike any other that human beings have developed; it will almost certainly allow the already powerful to consolidate their power further.

by Benjamin R. Barber

March 1992 “IN ALL THIS high-tech commercial world there is nothing that looks particularly democratic. It lends itself to surveillance as well as liberty, to new forms of manipulation and covert control as well as new kinds of participation, to skewed, unjust market outcomes as well as greater productivity. The consumer society and the open society are not quite synonymous. Capitalism and democracy have a relationship, but it is something less than a marriage.” Read more Matt Huynh

Consider surveillance. Numerous countries around the world, including several democracies, are busy building unprecedented systems of surveillance. For example, Israel is a leader in the field of surveillance technology, and has created in the occupied West Bank a working prototype for a total-surveillance regime. Already today whenever Palestinians make a phone call, post something on Facebook, or travel from one city to another, they are likely to be monitored by Israeli microphones, cameras, drones, or spy software. Algorithms analyze the gathered data, helping the Israeli security forces pinpoint and neutralize what they consider to be potential threats. The Palestinians may administer some towns and villages in the West Bank, but the Israelis command the sky, the airwaves, and cyberspace. It therefore takes surprisingly few Israeli soldiers to effectively control the roughly 2.5 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank.

In one incident in October 2017, a Palestinian laborer posted to his private Facebook account a picture of himself in his workplace, alongside a bulldozer. Adjacent to the image he wrote, “Good morning!” A Facebook translation algorithm made a small error when transliterating the Arabic letters. Instead of Ysabechhum (which means “Good morning”), the algorithm identified the letters as Ydbachhum (which means “Hurt them”). Suspecting that the man might be a terrorist intending to use a bulldozer to run people over, Israeli security forces swiftly arrested him. They released him after they realized that the algorithm had made a mistake. Even so, the offending Facebook post was taken down—you can never be too careful. What Palestinians are experiencing today in the West Bank may be just a primitive preview of what billions of people will eventually experience all over the planet.

Imagine, for instance, that the current regime in North Korea gained a more advanced version of this sort of technology in the future. North Koreans might be required to wear a biometric bracelet that monitors everything they do and say, as well as their blood pressure and brain activity. Using the growing understanding of the human brain and drawing on the immense powers of machine learning, the North Korean government might eventually be able to gauge what each and every citizen is thinking at each and every moment. If a North Korean looked at a picture of Kim Jong Un and the biometric sensors picked up telltale signs of anger (higher blood pressure, increased activity in the amygdala), that person could be in the gulag the next day.

The conflict between democracy and dictatorship is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems. AI may swing the advantage toward the latter.

And yet such hard-edged tactics may not prove necessary, at least much of the time. A facade of free choice and free voting may remain in place in some countries, even as the public exerts less and less actual control. To be sure, attempts to manipulate voters’ feelings are not new. But once somebody (whether in San Francisco or Beijing or Moscow) gains the technological ability to manipulate the human heart—reliably, cheaply, and at scale—democratic politics will mutate into an emotional puppet show.

We are unlikely to face a rebellion of sentient machines in the coming decades, but we might have to deal with hordes of bots that know how to press our emotional buttons better than our mother does and that use this uncanny ability, at the behest of a human elite, to try to sell us something—be it a car, a politician, or an entire ideology. The bots might identify our deepest fears, hatreds, and cravings and use them against us. We have already been given a foretaste of this in recent elections and referendums across the world, when hackers learned how to manipulate individual voters by analyzing data about them and exploiting their prejudices. While science-fiction thrillers are drawn to dramatic apocalypses of fire and smoke, in reality we may be facing a banal apocalypse by clicking.

The biggest and most frightening impact of the AI revolution might be on the relative efficiency of democracies and dictatorships. Historically, autocracies have faced crippling handicaps in regard to innovation and economic growth. In the late 20th century, democracies usually outperformed dictatorships, because they were far better at processing information. We tend to think about the conflict between democracy and dictatorship as a conflict between two different ethical systems, but it is actually a conflict between two different data-processing systems. Democracy distributes the power to process information and make decisions among many people and institutions, whereas dictatorship concentrates information and power in one place. Given 20th-century technology, it was inefficient to concentrate too much information and power in one place. Nobody had the ability to process all available information fast enough and make the right decisions. This is one reason the Soviet Union made far worse decisions than the United States, and why the Soviet economy lagged far behind the American economy.

However, artificial intelligence may soon swing the pendulum in the opposite direction. AI makes it possible to process enormous amounts of information centrally. In fact, it might make centralized systems far more efficient than diffuse systems, because machine learning works better when the machine has more information to analyze. If you disregard all privacy concerns and concentrate all the information relating to a billion people in one database, you’ll wind up with much better algorithms than if you respect individual privacy and have in your database only partial information on a million people. An authoritarian government that orders all its citizens to have their DNA sequenced and to share their medical data with some central authority would gain an immense advantage in genetics and medical research over societies in which medical data are strictly private. The main handicap of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century—the desire to concentrate all information and power in one place—may become their decisive advantage in the 21st century.

Yoshi Sodeoka

New technologies will continue to emerge, of course, and some of them may encourage the distribution rather than the concentration of information and power. Blockchain technology, and the use of cryptocurrencies enabled by it, is currently touted as a possible counterweight to centralized power. But blockchain technology is still in the embryonic stage, and we don’t yet know whether it will indeed counterbalance the centralizing tendencies of AI. Remember that the Internet, too, was hyped in its early days as a libertarian panacea that would free people from all centralized systems—but is now poised to make centralized authority more powerful than ever.

IV. The Transfer of Authority to Machines

Even if some societies remain ostensibly democratic, the increasing efficiency of algorithms will still shift more and more authority from individual humans to networked machines. We might willingly give up more and more authority over our lives because we will learn from experience to trust the algorithms more than our own feelings, eventually losing our ability to make many decisions for ourselves. Just think of the way that, within a mere two decades, billions of people have come to entrust Google’s search algorithm with one of the most important tasks of all: finding relevant and trustworthy information. As we rely more on Google for answers, our ability to locate information independently diminishes. Already today, “truth” is defined by the top results of a Google search. This process has likewise affected our physical abilities, such as navigating space. People ask Google not just to find information but also to guide them around. Self-driving cars and AI physicians would represent further erosion: While these innovations would put truckers and human doctors out of work, their larger import lies in the continuing transfer of authority and responsibility to machines.

Humans are used to thinking about life as a drama of decision making. Liberal democracy and free-market capitalism see the individual as an autonomous agent constantly making choices about the world. Works of art—be they Shakespeare plays, Jane Austen novels, or cheesy Hollywood comedies—usually revolve around the hero having to make some crucial decision. To be or not to be? To listen to my wife and kill King Duncan, or listen to my conscience and spare him? To marry Mr. Collins or Mr. Darcy? Christian and Muslim theology similarly focus on the drama of decision making, arguing that everlasting salvation depends on making the right choice.

What will happen to this view of life as we rely on AI to make ever more decisions for us? Even now we trust Netflix to recommend movies and Spotify to pick music we’ll like. But why should AI’s helpfulness stop there?

Every year millions of college students need to decide what to study. This is a very important and difficult decision, made under pressure from parents, friends, and professors who have varying interests and opinions. It is also influenced by students’ own individual fears and fantasies, which are themselves shaped by movies, novels, and advertising campaigns. Complicating matters, a given student does not really know what it takes to succeed in a given profession, and doesn’t necessarily have a realistic sense of his or her own strengths and weaknesses.

It’s not so hard to see how AI could one day make better decisions than we do about careers, and perhaps even about relationships. But once we begin to count on AI to decide what to study, where to work, and whom to date or even marry, human life will cease to be a drama of decision making, and our conception of life will need to change. Democratic elections and free markets might cease to make sense. So might most religions and works of art. Imagine Anna Karenina taking out her smartphone and asking Siri whether she should stay married to Karenin or elope with the dashing Count Vronsky. Or imagine your favorite Shakespeare play with all the crucial decisions made by a Google algorithm. Hamlet and Macbeth would have much more comfortable lives, but what kind of lives would those be? Do we have models for making sense of such lives?

Can parliaments and political parties overcome these challenges and forestall the darker scenarios? At the current moment this does not seem likely. Technological disruption is not even a leading item on the political agenda. During the 2016 U.S. presidential race, the main reference to disruptive technology concerned Hillary Clinton’s email debacle, and despite all the talk about job loss, neither candidate directly addressed the potential impact of automation. Donald Trump warned voters that Mexicans would take their jobs, and that the U.S. should therefore build a wall on its southern border. He never warned voters that algorithms would take their jobs, nor did he suggest building a firewall around California.

So what should we do?

For starters, we need to place a much higher priority on understanding how the human mind works—particularly how our own wisdom and compassion can be cultivated. If we invest too much in AI and too little in developing the human mind, the very sophisticated artificial intelligence of computers might serve only to empower the natural stupidity of humans, and to nurture our worst (but also, perhaps, most powerful) impulses, among them greed and hatred. To avoid such an outcome, for every dollar and every minute we invest in improving AI, we would be wise to invest a dollar and a minute in exploring and developing human consciousness.

More practically, and more immediately, if we want to prevent the concentration of all wealth and power in the hands of a small elite, we must regulate the ownership of data. In ancient times, land was the most important asset, so politics was a struggle to control land. In the modern era, machines and factories became more important than land, so political struggles focused on controlling these vital means of production. In the 21st century, data will eclipse both land and machinery as the most important asset, so politics will be a struggle to control data’s flow.

Unfortunately, we don’t have much experience in regulating the ownership of data, which is inherently a far more difficult task than regulating land or machines. Data are everywhere and nowhere at the same time, they can move at the speed of light, and you can create as many copies of them as you want. Do the data collected about my DNA, my brain, and my life belong to me, or to the government, or to a corporation, or to the human collective?

The race to accumulate data is already on, and is currently headed by giants such as Google and Facebook and, in China, Baidu and Tencent. So far, many of these companies have acted as “attention merchants”—they capture our attention by providing us with free information, services, and entertainment, and then they resell our attention to advertisers. Yet their true business isn’t merely selling ads. Rather, by capturing our attention they manage to accumulate immense amounts of data about us, which are worth more than any advertising revenue. We aren’t their customers—we are their product.

Ordinary people will find it very difficult to resist this process. At present, many of us are happy to give away our most valuable asset—our personal data—in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. But if, later on, ordinary people decide to try to block the flow of data, they are likely to have trouble doing so, especially as they may have come to rely on the network to help them make decisions, and even for their health and physical survival.

Nationalization of data by governments could offer one solution; it would certainly curb the power of big corporations. But history suggests that we are not necessarily better off in the hands of overmighty governments. So we had better call upon our scientists, our philosophers, our lawyers, and even our poets to turn their attention to this big question: How do you regulate the ownership of data?

Currently, humans risk becoming similar to domesticated animals. We have bred docile cows that produce enormous amounts of milk but are otherwise far inferior to their wild ancestors. They are less agile, less curious, and less resourceful. We are now creating tame humans who produce enormous amounts of data and function as efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism, but they hardly maximize their human potential. If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded computers to wreak havoc on themselves and on the world.

If you find these prospects alarming—if you dislike the idea of living in a digital dictatorship or some similarly degraded form of society—then the most important contribution you can make is to find ways to prevent too much data from being concentrated in too few hands, and also find ways to keep distributed data processing more efficient than centralized data processing. These will not be easy tasks. But achieving them may be the best safeguard of democracy.""",1

1762,"Around 7% of adult Americans have had long COVID symptoms lasting 3 months or more, with more than a quarter experiencing severe limitations in their daily activities, according to a U.S. government survey.

Many experts fear long-term ripple effects and urge a focused effort on research, clinical treatment, and building a more inclusive labor market. Women are almost twice as likely as men to experience long COVID symptoms, and those with existing medical conditions or limited access to healthcare are at higher risk. The latest population surveys and studies from around the world suggest that vaccines can reduce the risk of long COVID.

 Do the horrors ever end? 
 The U.S. military continues to find anomalous ingredients in Covid-19 vaccines that manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna manufactured--and allegedly attenuated--for children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old. Last week, Real Raw News exclusively reported that the military had found the drug scopolamine, a hallucinogenic mixture with harmful properties, at mass vaccination centers in New York, California, and Washington. The criminal Biden regime and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky have said 'these shots will protect our children against the deadliest disease we've ever faced.' White Hats within the U.S. military, however, have been scouting these bulk vaccination sites and surreptitiously confiscating vaccine vials for chemical analysis. The latest data show that samples acquired from a vaccination center in Redmond, Washington, contain the venom of the tarantula hawk wasp, which, according to entomologist Justin Schmidt, ranks among the most painful stings on the planet.

1790,"""A year and a half ago, less than three weeks before the presidential election, the New York Post published a story about the recovery of a laptop that allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden, and a trove of personal emails and photographs allegedly found on it. Many were embarrassing; a few were interesting enough to become memes. (The most indelible—the authenticity of which I have not personally verified—is of Hunter smoking a cigarette in a bathtub.) The meat of the article was the claim that the younger Biden had traded inappropriately on his family name, up to the point of arranging meetings between his Ukrainian business associates and his father, while the latter was vice president.

President Donald Trump’s camp made the story out to be more than it was—Hunter Biden was already well known for invoking his family’s political fame to help him make money, and he denied the specific allegations of wrongdoing (though a broader investigation into his affairs has been ongoing for years, led by federal prosecutors in Delaware, working with the FBI and the IRS). The story’s claims about Joe Biden’s participation were weak (at best). It quickly came out that some of the Post’s own staff did not think that the paper had done enough to confirm the authenticity of the laptop. But the story was a lit match, and the national mood at the time was kerosene.

Trump was actively undermining democracy and pushing his supporters toward hysteria about online censorship. His party was gripped by QAnon, which holds at the center of its belief system the idea that the Democratic elite are sleazy and corrupt. The laptop was a gift to the paranoid and the disingenuous. Meanwhile, the other half of the country was gripped by the memory of 2016. What if voters were faced with an eleventh-hour red herring, another disaster like the James Comey letter? What if reporters fell for another trick from zany upstart “citizen journalists” with enormous follower counts—or, worse, Russia? And journalists who had spent four years telling themselves that they were the nation’s last defense against tyranny were, to put it as politely as I can, starting to appear a bit hysterical. By the way, there was still a pandemic. Enter flames.

To many members of the media and tech industries, the timing of the story felt suspicious, as did the fact that it came from Rudy Giuliani, a MAGA operative and one of the oddest people alive. Reporters recoiled from the story; columnists blasted the Post for publishing personally embarrassing information that was of tenuous public interest. Social-media companies also reacted instantly. Facebook limited the spread of the story while third-party fact-checkers reviewed it (but removed the limitation after a week). Twitter took the more dramatic action of blocking new shares of the link altogether, arguing that the story, which contained screenshots with unobscured email addresses and phone numbers, constituted a violation of its policy on doxxing (it reversed course after two days).

Some of the story turned out to be true, but not right away. The New York Times and The Washington Post were only recently able to verify many of the emails. And in the intervening months, many of the details about why journalists and tech companies acted the way they did have been forgotten, leaving behind only the impression, mostly on the right, that they “colluded” to keep Americans away from an authentic news story with political implications. The truth was more boring and possibly grimmer.

If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: This single water-damaged laptop represented an end point. Americans no longer had a method for coming to agreement about what was—in the most basic sense—going on. Eighteen months later, there’s nothing anyone could ever say about this laptop that would bring Americans into alignment about its significance and meaning, or about the culpability and agendas of those who have previously expressed opinions on it. In fact, if anything, things have gotten worse.

Earlier this month, The Atlantic co-hosted a conference with the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics, called “Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy,” at which Hunter Biden’s laptop was a star of the show.

It came up in the very first Q&A session of the conference. A University of Chicago freshman and a senior editor of the campus’s right-wing publication (tagline: “Outthink the mob”) asked my colleague Anne Applebaum whether “the media acted inappropriately when they instantly dismissed Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation.” The student was unsatisfied with Applebaum’s answer—that she didn’t think the laptop qualified as a major news story, disinformation or no—and later appeared on Fox News to say so. His tweet about the exchange, which incorrectly stated that Appelebaum had failed to answer the question, went viral. This kicked off a vitriolic and widespread campaign against Applebaum from the right, pushed by influencers including Jack Posobiec, Mike Cernovich, and multiple Fox News hosts; she was subjected to weeks of personal threats.

The laptop came up again the next day, first thing in the morning. A panel discussion titled “Politics as Usual or an Insidious Attack on Our Democracy?” took its premise from a November 2021 column by Ben Smith, then of The New York Times, in which he used the Biden laptop story to demonstrate how confusing the conversation about misinformation and disinformation had become. In dealing with the laptop, reporters were understandably wary of repeating the mistakes made regarding the WikiLeaks hack-and-dump operation before the 2016 election, which led to over-coverage of the Hillary Clinton email scandal, which was ultimately inconsequential. That’s why many of them dismissed the story, or labeled it a new front in the information war. But many presidential election cycles have unearthed confusing, scandalous revelations requiring investigative journalism to verify or debunk them, Smith argued. Labeling this a problem of the social-media age, and focusing on mis- or disinformation as phenomena that can be corrected, hidden, or blocked at the platform level, is “a technocratic solution to a problem that’s as much about politics as technology,” he wrote. He reiterated much of this during the panel, saying that the laptop story had been mishandled by reporters and, “most disturbingly,” by social-media companies.

I heard this opinion repeatedly in casual conversations and from the speakers onstage. Jonah Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Dispatch, argued during the panel that the “disinformation” label can backfire by feeding into the idea that the “powers that be” are forbidding people from looking at information that they consider illegitimate. He illustrated his point with Biden’s laptop too. Twitter and Facebook treated it like disinformation before the truth could be determined. “Whether you think that was smart in the heat of the moment or not, [it] has backfired enormously,” he said. “Because now it seems like it was all conspiratorial.”

I was a little surprised by how often the laptop came up, but I shouldn’t have been. Its aura has grown ever more powerful as the story around it has cohered. After a short period during which Fox News also considered the laptop story suspect, the network has been covering it even more intensely than it did the leaked Democratic National Committee emails in 2016. In December 2020, when I was interviewing users of the alternative social-media platform Parler, almost everybody I spoke with brought it up. A cool, anonymous Substack writer beloved by New York City’s art set has also made frequent disapproving reference to Twitter’s and Facebook’s actions around the laptop story. Angry online chatter about it never truly went away, but now it’s back with a vengeance. All of my friends know that something went wrong with the laptop. Many of them do not care, but they still know. This week, hours after the news broke that Elon Musk would be acquiring Twitter, he replied to a tweet in which Twitter’s chief legal officer and general counsel Vijaya Gadde was referred to as the company’s top “censorship advocate,” writing, “Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.”

That cursed computer, otherwise known as “the laptop from hell,” as Donald Trump has called it, is an icon of our information ecosystem’s dysfunction. Some journalists relied prematurely and too much on popular frameworks when covering it. The story really was suppressed by tech giants. But it also really was complicated, and required time and resources to investigate. Finding the truth takes time and effort and a willingness to be surprised. It also requires some grace on the part of the public—journalists need to be able to publish facts bit by bit, as they learn them, doing their work in front of an audience that is receptive to the idea that knowledge shifts and that coherent drama that blazes forth all at once is rare. This is, the laptop makes clear, no longer possible. By the time reporters put in the work to verify parts of the story, it was too late—the corrupt “media” was a monolith with an agenda.

Facebook and Twitter really did make sloppy decisions. They and other tech platforms had spent the past several years struggling with how to fact-check a pandemic and when to interfere with election interference; the laptop undermined that work by illustrating just how bizarre—and dangerous—it would be to centralize the responsibility for discerning truth. Twitter has apologized for its handling of the story and made changes to its policy on the distribution of hacked materials. Facebook has elaborated on its decision-making process, which was informed by the FBI’s warning to watch for hack-and-leak operations carried out by foreign actors. And if federal prosecutors indict Hunter Biden for possible financial crimes, it will not be solely on the basis of the man’s laptop, so the case could be made that the thing doesn’t matter much anymore. Yet it isn’t going anywhere. Why would it? It’s perfect!

“This is arguably the most well-known story the New York Post has ever published and it endures as a story because it was initially suppressed by social media companies and jeered by politicians and pundits alike,” Joan Donovan, the research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy and a speaker at the conference, told me in an email. The laptop is now shorthand, and it makes an easy point. For example, after another panel at the conference, a University of Chicago student asked CNN’s Brian Stelter a question to which there was undoubtedly no satisfying answer: Invoking the Biden laptop, he asked, “With mainstream corporate journalists becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime, is it time to finally declare that the canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?” Stelter’s response was polite, if a bit meandering, and he offered to speak with the student one-on-one after the event, which he apparently did.

Even though this sequence of events was a bit dry, it was useful all the same. A video of the exchange was viewed millions of times on Twitter that Thursday, under the caption “Brian Stelter just got destroyed by a college freshman!” It was featured two days later on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show, and Carlson was giddy while describing it. “There are still a couple of kids at the University of Chicago who are awake enough to say, ‘Wait a second, what are you talking about? Disinformation?’” After playing the video, he cracked himself up.""",1

1793,"""Science once again catching up with what many already knew – but this is progress: A new scientific study has investigated the toxicity of various drugs and found Marijuana the clear winner. It’s been found significantly less toxic than all the other substances on the list – including not only illegal drugs but the LEGAL alcohol and tobacco. Here’s our full report.

Claims on marijuana’s medicinal values have been widely debated despite support from medical research and study. Federal legislations that govern marijuana use aim to restrict rather than regulate – and this has posed a problem to people seeking the medicinal and recreational effects of the herb, very far from intentions of abusing its effects. What is it about marijuana that scares the government – and the public – so much?

Marijuana Use in the United States

Marijuana, colloquially referred to as weed or pot, is made up of dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Statistics released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse reveal that in respondents aged 18 to 25, more than half (exactly 51.90 percent) have used marijuana. Percentages are lower in the other two age groups, with 16.40 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 and 45.70 percent of respondents aged 26 and older reporting marijuana use. [1]

Laws in more than half the number of states in the US prohibit marijuana use, whether recreationally or medically. Currently (2015), only 21 states plus the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs) that recognize and permit the medicinal use of the herb. [2]

Numerous studies have reported the positive medicinal effects of marijuana on pain, sleep, and overall comfort. A survey conducted by Trip, et. al. (2014) revealed that marijuana use was effective in improving mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep quality in patient with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. [3] The data collected from a more recent study in 2015 by Degenhardt, et. al. revealed that marijuana use in conjunction with prescribed opioids were able to induce effective pain relief in respondents experiencing chronic non-cancer pain. [4] These studies further support the popularity of marijuana use among people experiencing acute and chronic pain.

On the other hand, there have also been studies on the adverse effects of marijuana. One of these was published in mid-2014, focusing the negative health effects of smoking marijuana, particularly on the increased risk for lung cancer. [5] Of course, the study was only able to reveal how it was smoke (not cannabis itself) that damages lung tissue. This problem could easily be solved by changing the method in which marijuana is administered.

Risk Assessment of Marijuana and Other Substances

But is marijuana use as dangerous as the law makes it out to be? The intoxicating effects of marijuana, although different, are not thought more severe than that of mild to moderate alcohol intake – a substance that is not illegal anywhere in the United States, or most countries all over the world. A study published in January 2015 by Lechenmeier and Rehm [6] assessed the comparative risk between different “mind-altering” substances, specifically alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drugs like heroin. Surprisingly, the study revealed that cannabis was the least risky substance, belonging to the other end of the spectrum. Do you know what substance was revealed the most risky? Alcohol.

How is this possible? The study used an approach called the Margin of Exposure (MOE) which is drastically different from other studies that simply attempted to find causational relationship between two factors – (1) substance use/abuse and (2) mortality. MOE is different; it’s a ratio between the estimated (average) human intake and the benchmark dose (or toxicological threshold). Basically, it’s a ratio between how much humans typically intake and the dose at which the substance becomes dangerous – which is a better judge of how risky a substance can be. The higher the MOE is, the higher its spot on the list.

The results of the study were conclusive: The highest spot belonged to alcohol, while the succeeding spots were filled by heroin, cocaine, nicotine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, amphetamine, diazepam, and THC (or marijuana). With marijuana in the lowest spot (over 100 times less toxic than alcohol), it can be surmised that its effects on health and society have been largely overestimated. If there was a plant that couldn’t be more misunderstood – or was it perhaps intentionally maligned – it has to be marijuana.

It’s important to note that the study measured toxic effects and does not consider any social effects of the use of the drug. However, this result is a clear indication that policies on marijuana are outdated and need re-evaluation – which is something that is gradually happening. It’s good news for the herband for the use of herbs in general.

They had expected to find commercial-grade freezers brimming with bags of chilled Adrenochrome—a pharmaceutical cocktail made of of fluids extracted from the adrenal glands of terrified children and synthetic opioids—but found instead coolers containing organs—livers, lungs, kidneys, hearts, and, yes, intestines—that had been excised from adolescent children.

“This is the sickest and most gruesome find we’ve made,” said a source in General David H. Berger’s office, as he recounted the details to Real Raw News.

On October 27, U.S. Army Cyber Command received what it believed was a credible tip that Adrenochrome injections and infusion bags were stored at the Chatsworth warehouse. Cyber Command sent details to Gen. Berger, who felt data merited further investigation and on October 29 authorized the deployment of a USMC scout-sniper squad to surveil the warehouse and, if considered proper, penetrate the warehouse, eliminate the opposition, and destroy Adrenochrome found on the premises.

The following evening a Scout-Sniper platoon arrived at the warehouse. It appeared unguarded, unoccupied, and in disrepair. A single floodlamp splashed light on a vacant parking lot, and the warehouse doors were secured with a rusted chain and two large padlocks.

“At first I thought this can’t be the place,” a Marine later said during a debrief. “I was sure we’d been given the wrong location. After we got inside, I wished it were the wrong place.”

The Marines used bolt cutters to break the shackles, and they tactically entered the shadowy structure. They heard the electrical hum emanating from an array of chest freezers lining the rear wall even before switching on the flickering, fluorescent lights that filled the room with their own unique buzz. In the center of the room sat four metal gurneys, each stained with dried blood and what the Marines took to be bits of necrotic flesh. There were needles, vacutainers, empty IV bags, and scalpels scattered about the floor.

When the Marines pried open the first freezer, they saw the unthinkable: hermetically sealed polyurethane bags, some covered in a hoarfrost haze, held human organs that had been surgically removed from their hosts. The bags were stacked atop each other, and each had a date written in indelible ink—ostensibly indicating when evil parties had harvested the organs.

A refrigerator had two hundred bags of whole blood, meaning it hadn’t been spun in centrifuges to separate it into transfusable components: red cells, platelets, and plasma.

And inside a chest freezer they found the flayed, frozen corpses of two prepubescent girls who had been sliced open from stem to sternum. They had no blood–they’d been exsanguinated. Someone had removed their organs and crammed their lifeless bodies in the freezer.

The Marines made similar finds in other coolers and freezers.

“This is absolutely the most macabre scene we’ve come across,” a source in Gen. David H. Berger’s office told Real Raw News. “Our best guess is this was happening for a while, and whomever was doing this abandoned the place. Maybe they were tipped off.

In closing, he said the warehouse was leased to a medical manufacturer that does business with the federal government. He would not disclose the name because the military is engaged in effort to locate persons tied to the lease.

1863,"""Home / Document Library / Fact Sheets / 2001 / Background on China's WTO Accession Background Information on China's Accession to the World Trade Organization

World Trade Organization (WTO) members formally approved an agreement on the terms of accession for the People's Republic of China (China) on November 10, 2001 at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar. One day later, China signed the agreement and deposited its instrument of ratification with the Director-General of the WTO. China became the 143rd member of the WTO on December 11, 2001. Background In July of 1986, China applied for admission to the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The GATT formed a Working Party in March of 1987, composed of all interested GATT contracting parties, to examine China's application and negotiate terms for China's accession. For the next eight years, negotiations were conducted under the auspices of the GATT Working Party. Following the formation of the WTO on January 1, 1995, a successor WTO Working Party, composed of all interested WTO members, took over the negotiations. Like all WTO accession negotiations, the negotiations with China had three basic aspects. First, China provided information to the Working Party regarding its trade regime. China also updated this information periodically during the 15 years of negotiations to reflect changes in its trade regime. Second, each interested WTO member negotiated bilaterally with China regarding market access concessions and commitments in the goods and services areas, including, for example, the tariffs that will apply on industrial and agricultural goods and the commitments that China is making to open up its market to foreign services suppliers. The most trade liberalizing of the concessions and commitments obtained through these bilateral negotiations were consolidated into China's Goods and Services Schedules and will apply to all WTO members. Third, overlapping in time with these bilateral negotiations, China engaged in multilateral negotiations with Working Party members on the rules that will govern trade with China. The rules commitments made by China in this area are set forth in its Protocol of Accession and an accompanying Report of the Working Party. China's Protocol of Accession, accompanying Working Party Report and Goods and Services Schedules are available on the WTO's website (www.wto.org).

Overview With its accession to the WTO, China will be implementing significant changes to its trade regime, at all levels of government. Although it has been gradually transitioning toward a market economy from what had been a strict command economy two decades ago, China is now taking on the far-reaching obligations of membership in the WTO, a rules-based system that requires its members to operate with openness and transparency and stresses the central role of markets and private enterprise. In order to accede to the WTO, China has committed to undertake important systemic reforms, which should facilitate business dealings. China has also committed to take concrete steps to remove trade barriers and open its markets to foreign companies and their exports from the first day of accession in virtually every product sector and for a wide range of services. Supporting these steps, China has also committed to eliminate or significantly reduce restrictions on the rights of foreign companies to import and export goods and to distribute goods within China, and it has further committed to rectify numerous trade-distortive industrial and agricultural policies. The openness, accountability and changes required by China's commitments should strengthen and accelerate the achievement of China's economic reform goals. China's ministries and agencies will transition out of their old role of directing and controlling how and with whom Chinese enterprises do business. Increasingly, they will need to focus on the implementation and enforcement of laws, regulations and other measures that will help to promote the smooth functioning of markets. Meanwhile, State-owned enterprises will face greater accountability for their business decisions, and together with other Chinese enterprises they will face the full forces of global competition for the first time. Substantive Highlights The commitments contained in China's accession agreement are numerous and wide-ranging, and they are enforceable: » China has committed to undertake systemic reforms that will promote transparency, predictability and fairness in business dealings; » China will assume the obligations of more than 20 existing multilateral WTO agreements, with only minimal transition periods where necessary; » China has made numerous trade-liberalizing commitments that take into account the special characteristics of China's economy and will help to improve market access across sectors; » China will make substantial tariff reductions on industrial and agricultural goods of importance to U.S. businesses and farmers; » China has made far-reaching services commitments that should substantially increase market access for U.S. services suppliers; » With regard to the enforcement of China's commitments, the accession agreement creates a special multilateral mechanism for reviewing China's compliance on an annual basis, and it confirms that dispute settlement is a tool that is available to WTO members; and » China has consented to the creation of special safeguard mechanisms to protect businesses, farmers and workers of existing WTO members.



Systemic Reforms. China has committed to broad reforms in the areas of transparency, notice and comment, uniform application of laws and judicial review. Each of these reforms will strengthen the rule of law in China and help to address practices that have made it difficult for U.S. and other foreign companies to do business in China. Transparency. » China will translate all laws, regulations or other measures, at all levels of government, relating to trade in goods or services into one or more of the WTO languages (English, French and Spanish), including the hundreds of laws, regulations and other measures that it will have to modify or adopt to become WTO-compliant.

» China will designate official journals, which will regularly publish these laws, regulations and other measures and provide additional relevant information, such as the identity of the responsible government authorities and the effective date for a particular measure.

» China will also establish enquiry points where any WTO member or foreign company or individual can request more information about these laws, regulations and other measures. These enquiry points will normally provide responses to inquiries within 30 days. Notice and Comment.

» Before implementing or enforcing a law, regulation or other measure relating to trade in goods or services, China has committed to publish it in an official journal and to provide a reasonable period for comment to the appropriate government authorities, except in extraordinary circumstances. Uniform Application of Laws.

» China is committed, at all levels of government, to apply, implement and administer all of its laws, regulations and other measures relating to trade in goods and services in a uniform and impartial manner throughout China, including in special economic areas.

» China will also establish an internal review mechanism to investigate and address cases of non-uniform application of laws based on information provided by companies or individuals. Judicial Review.

» China is committed to establish tribunals for the review of all administrative actions relating to the implementation of laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application involving matters such as requirements, restrictions or prohibitions on imported goods or exported goods or affecting their sale, distribution, transportation or other use and the regulation, control, supply or promotion of a service, among other matters. These tribunals must be impartial and independent of the government authorities entrusted with the administrative enforcement in question, and their review procedures must include the right of appeal.

» China has also agreed to enforce only those laws, regulations and other measures relating to trade in goods and services that have been published in an official journal. Adherence to Existing Multilateral WTO Agreements. China's agreement includes China's commitment to assume the obligations of more than 20 existing multilateral WTO agreements, covering all areas of trade, such as: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China will be taking on the obligations of the GATT, the WTO agreement that lays down core principles, such as non-discrimination and national treatment, that constrain and guide national trade policies. Agriculture. In addition to taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to agriculture, China made several additional commitments in its accession agreement that will help to rectify numerous agricultural policies upon accession or after limited transition periods. For example:

» China has committed not to provide export subsidies.

» China has also committed to a cap for trade- and production-distorting domestic subsidies that is lower than the cap permitted developing countries and that includes the same elements that developed countries use in determining whether the cap has been reached.

» China lifted long-standing bans on the importation of agricultural goods such as corn, wheat, citrus products and meat (during the course of the U.S.-China bilateral negotiations as a sign of good faith).

» China must implement tariff-rate quotas that provide significant market access for bulk goods of special importance to American farmers such as grains, soy oil and cotton upon accession.

» China has agreed to eliminate import monopolies maintained by State trading enterprises on agricultural goods such as wheat, rice and corn and to permit non-State trading enterprises to import them. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. As a result of taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, China is committed to apply science-based sanitary and phytosanitary standards to all agricultural goods, including grains, meats and fruits. Technical Barriers to Trade. As a result of taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to technical barriers to trade and additional commitments set forth in China's accession agreement, China must ensure that its conformity assessment bodies operate with transparency, apply the same technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures to both imported and domestic goods and use the same fees, processing periods and complaint procedures for both imported and domestic goods. In addition, China must ensure that all of its conformity assessment bodies are authorized to handle both imported and domestic goods within one year of accession. China will also accept the Code of Good Practice (set forth in an annex to the WTO agreement relating to technical barriers to trade) within four months after accession, and it will speed up its process of reviewing existing technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures and harmonizing them with international norms. Trade-related Investment Measures (TRIMs). In addition to taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to investment measures, China has agreed to eliminate export performance, local content and foreign exchange balancing requirements from its laws, regulations and other measures, and China also will not enforce the terms of any contracts imposing these requirements. China has also agreed that it will no longer condition importation or investment approvals on these requirements or on requirements such as technology transfer and offsets. China has further agreed that it will only impose, apply or enforce laws, regulations or other measures relating to the transfer of technology that are not inconsistent with the TRIMs Agreement (or the TRIPS Agreement). Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). With its acceptance of the WTO agreement relating to intellectual property rights, China will have the obligation to adhere to internationally accepted norms to protect and enforce the intellectual property rights of U.S. and other foreign companies and individuals in China. China is in the process of modifying the full range of intellectual property laws and regulations, including those relating to patents, trademarks, trade secrets, integrated circuits and copyrights. In addition, China is committed to strengthen the enforcement of these laws and regulations by its courts and the responsible administrative agencies. Subsidies. In addition to taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to industrial subsidies, China made several additional commitments in its accession agreement that will help to address trade-distortive industrial policies directed at providing financial and other assistance to State-owned enterprises in China.

» China has committed to eliminate all export subsidies benefitting industrial goods upon accession.

» When seeking to enforce subsidies disciplines against Chinese enterprises, either in individual WTO members' countervailing duty proceedings or in WTO enforcement proceedings, WTO members can identify and measure Chinese government subsidies using alternative methods in order to account for the special characteristics of China's economy. For example, when determining whether preferential government benefits in the form of, for example, equity infusions or loans have been provided to a Chinese enterprise, WTO members can use foreign or other market-based criteria rather than Chinese government benchmarks.

» Special rules also govern the actionability of subsidies provided to State-owned enterprises, both in individual WTO member's countervailing duty proceedings and in WTO enforcement proceedings. Import Licensing. As a result of taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to import licensing, China has committed to implement an import licensing system that does not act as a trade barrier and that complies with the principles of national treatment and non-discrimination. In its accession agreement, China further committed not to condition the issuance of import licenses on performance requirements of any kind, such as local content, export performance, offsets, technology transfer or research and development, or on whether competing domestic suppliers exist. Rules of Origin. In addition to taking on the obligations of the WTO agreement relating to rules of origin, China specifically agreed to adopt the internationally harmonized non-preferential rules of origin once they were completed. China also confirmed that it would use rules of origin equally for all purposes and that it would not use rules of origin as an instrument to pursue trade objectives either directly or indirectly. In addition, by the date of its accession to the WTO, China must establish a mechanism to provide, upon request, an assessment of the origin of an import or export. Customs Valuation. China will implement its obligations under the WTO agreement relating to customs valuation upon accession, without any transition period. In addition, China's accession agreement reinforces China's obligation not to use minimum or reference prices as a means for determining customs value, and it calls on China to implement the World Customs Organization Decisions on Valuation of Carrier Media Bearing Software for Data Processing Equipment and Treatment of Interest Charges in Customs Value of Imported Goods within two years after accession. Preshipment Inspection. China must comply with its obligations under the WTO agreement relating to preshipment inspection and ensure that any private preshipment inspection companies comply with WTO rules, particularly with regard to valuation and fees. China-Specific Trade-Liberalizing Commitments. China's agreement also includes numerous China-specific trade-liberalizing commitments. The most significant of these commitments are as follows: Trading Rights. Prior to its accession, China restricted the number of companies with trading rights, i.e, the right to import and export goods, and the products that a particular company can import or export. China will phase in trading rights for all Chinese-invested enterprises and all foreign-invested enterprises and individuals over a three-year period. Upon accession, Chinese enterprises will have full trading rights, subject to certain minimum registered capital requirements, which will be phased down during the three-year transition period. Joint ventures with minority foreign ownership will be granted full trading rights within one year after accession, and joint ventures with majority foreign ownership will be granted full trading rights within two years after accession. All enterprises in China and all foreign enterprises and individuals will be granted full trading rights within three years after accession. Distribution of Goods within China. Prior to its accession, China generally did not permit foreign companies to distribute products through wholesale and retail systems in China or to provide related distribution services, such as repair and maintenance services. These prohibitions will be phased out over three years, subject to limited exceptions. Generally, upon accession, foreign-invested enterprises will have the right to distribute and provide related services for goods made in China. Within two years after accession, foreign-invested enterprises will have the right to distribute goods, whether made in China or imported, and provide related services. Within three years, foreign-invested enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises will have the right to distribute and provide related services for almost all types of goods, whether made in China or imported. Non-tariff Measures (NTMs). China is committed to the phase-out of trade-distortive NTMs such as quotas and licenses covering hundreds of products. Most of these NTMs must be eliminated upon accession, while the remainder of them must be eliminated within three years after accession. State Trading Enterprises. In addition to eliminating import monopolies maintained by State trading enterprises in China on many industrial goods upon accession, China has agreed to provide full information on the pricing mechanisms of State trading enterprises and to ensure that their import purchasing procedures are transparent and fully in compliance with WTO rules. China has also agreed that State trading enterprises will limit the mark-up on goods that they import in order to avoid trade distortions. State-owned Enterprises. Among the many provisions in China's accession agreement directly or indirectly addressing State-owned (and State-invested) enterprises, China has agreed that laws, regulations and other measures relating to the purchase and commercial sale and production of goods or supply of services for commercial sale by State-owned (and State- invested) enterprises or for use in non-governmental purposes will be subject to WTO rules. China has also agreed that State-owned enterprises must make purchases and sales based solely on commercial considerations, such as price, quality, marketability and availability, and that the government will not influence the commercial decisions of State-owned enterprises. Price Controls. In an annex to its accession agreement, China provided detailed information on the limited number of products and services subject to price control or government guidance pricing and the procedures for establishing prices. China has also agreed that it will not use price controls to restrict the level of imports of goods or services. Special Economic Areas. China is committed to non-discrimination in the treatment of enterprises within its special economic areas. Tariff Reductions. When China's Goods Schedule goes into effect at the time of China's accession, greatly increased market access will be realized by U.S. and other foreign companies through cuts in China's tariffs on industrial and agricultural goods. Although these reductions generally take place over a period of five years, in almost all instances most of the reductions will take place upon accession. Industrial Goods. Tariffs on industrial goods of greatest importance to U.S. businesses will be reduced from a base average of 25 percent (in 1997) to 7 percent. More specific highlights include: » China has agreed to participate in the Information Technology Agreement, which requires the elimination of tariffs on computers, semiconductors and other information technology products. China's elimination of these tariffs will be completed by January 1, 2005.

» China will be implementing the required tariff reductions on more than two-thirds of the 1,100-plus products covered by the WTO's Chemical Tariff Harmonization Agreement.

» Tariffs on autos will be reduced from 80-100 percent to 25 percent (by July 1, 2006), and tariffs on auto parts will be reduced from a base average of 23 percent to 9.5 percent (by January 1, 2006).

» Tariffs in the wood and paper sectors will be reduced from a 1997 average of 18 percent on wood and 15-25 percent on paper to 5 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. Agricultural Goods. Tariffs on agricultural goods of greatest importance to U.S. farmers will be reduced from a 1997 average of 31 percent to 14 percent. Services Commitments. As set forth in China's Services Schedule, China has committed to the substantial opening of a broad range of services sectors through the elimination of many existing limitations on market access, at all levels of government, particularly in sectors of importance to the United States, such as banking, insurance, telecommunications and professional services. Notably, these commitments represent only the minimum level of market access that China will be expected to make available once it becomes a WTO member. Nothing in China's Services Schedule precludes the Chinese government from applying more liberal measures that would allow foreign companies to provide services with even fewer limitations on market access. Banking. Prior to its accession, China limited foreign banks to foreign currency business in selected cities. Although China also permitted, on an experimental basis, foreign banks to conduct local currency business, the experiment was limited to foreign customers in two cities. China has now committed to providing the following market access in its accession agreement:

» New licenses must be granted to foreign banks based solely on prudential criteria, with no quantitative limits on the number of licenses or restrictions such as an economic-needs test.

» Immediately upon accession, U.S. and other foreign banks will be able to conduct foreign currency business with Chinese enterprises and individuals throughout China.

» The ability of U.S. and other foreign banks to conduct domestic currency business with Chinese enterprises and individuals will be phased in. Within two years after accession, foreign banks will be able to conduct domestic currency business with Chinese enterprises, subject to certain geographic restrictions. Within five years after accession, foreign banks will also be able to conduct domestic currency business with Chinese individuals, and all geographic restrictions will be lifted.

» Foreign banks will be permitted to provide financial leasing services at the same time that Chinese banks are permitted to do so.

» Some restrictions apply to the form in which foreign banks may establish in China during the first five years after accession, but thereafter these restrictions are eliminated. Insurance. Prior to its accession, China allowed selected foreign insurers to operate in China on a limited basis in two cities. Three U.S. insurers had licenses to operate, and more than 20 additional U.S. insurers were waiting for approval of their licenses by China's regulatory authorities.

» As with all other services sectors, the existing conditions of ownership, operation and scope of activities in the insurance services sector will not be made more restrictive than they are on the date of China's accession to the WTO.

» After accession, China is committed to award new licenses to qualified foreign insurers based solely on prudential criteria, with no quantitative limits on the number of licenses or restrictions such as an economic-needs test.

» Foreign life insurers will be permitted to hold 50 percent equity share in a joint venture upon accession.

» Foreign property, casualty and other non-life insurers will be permitted to establish as a branch or as a joint venture with 51 percent foreign equity share upon accession and as a wholly owned subsidiary two years after accession.

» For foreign insurers handling large scale commercial risks, marine, aviation and transport insurance and reinsurance, 50 percent foreign equity share in a joint venture will be permitted upon accession. The limit on foreign equity share in a joint venture for these insurers will increase to 51 percent three years after accession, and wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries will be permitted five years after accession.

» Existing geographic restrictions on all types of insurance operations will be progressively eliminated during the first three years after accession.

» Foreign insurers will be permitted to expand the scope of their activities to include group, health and pension lines of insurance within five years after accession. Telecommunications. Prior to China's accession, foreign companies were prohibited from providing telecommunications services in China. After China's accession, foreign services suppliers will be permitted to provide a broad range of services:

» For domestic and international wired services, foreign services suppliers will be permitted to establish joint ventures with 25 percent foreign equity share within three years after accession, subject to certain geographic restrictions. The permitted foreign equity share will increase to 35 percent within five years after accession and 49 percent within six years after accession. All geographic restrictions will be eliminated within six years after accession.

» In the area of mobile voice and data services, foreign services suppliers will be permitted to establish joint ventures with 25 percent foreign equity share upon accession, subject to certain geographic restrictions. The permitted foreign equity share will increase to 35 percent within one year after accession and 49 percent within three years after accession. All geographic restrictions will be eliminated within five years after accession.

» In the area of value-added services, such as electronic mail, voice mail and on-line information and database retrieval, and in the area of paging services, foreign services suppliers will be permitted to establish joint ventures with 30 percent foreign equity share upon accession, subject to certain geographic restrictions. The permitted foreign equity share will increase to 49 percent within one year after accession and 50 percent within two years after accession. All geographic restrictions will be eliminated within two years after accession.

» Even though not explicitly scheduled by China, Internet services are subsumed under the area of value-added services following the scheduling convention of most WTO members, including the United States.

» Importantly, China has also accepted key principles from the WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services. As a result, China will have to separate the regulatory and operating functions of its Ministry of Information Industry (which has been both the telecommunications regulatory agency in China and the operator of the China Telecom monopoly). China will also have to adopt pro-competitive regulatory principles, such as cost-based pricing and the right of interconnection, which are necessary for foreign-invested joint ventures to compete with China Telecom.



Professional Services. Prior to its accession, China greatly restricted the ability of foreign suppliers to provide professional services in China. China's accession agreement lifts many of these restrictions.

» In the area of legal services, prior to its accession, China had maintained a prohibition against foreign law firms practicing Chinese law, along with restrictions on formal affiliation with Chinese law firms. China's accession agreement provides that, upon China's accession, foreign law firms will be able to open up one profit-making representative office, which must be located in one of several designated cities in China, and they will be able to advise clients on foreign legal matters in China and to provide information on the Chinese legal environment. They will also be able to maintain long-term ""entrustment"" relationships with Chinese law firms and be able to instruct lawyers in the Chinese law firm as agreed between the two law firms. All quantitative and geographic restrictions will be phased out within one year of China's accession, which means that foreign law firms will be able to open more than one office anywhere in China.

» Foreign accounting firms will be permitted to affiliate with Chinese firms for the first time upon accession. Foreign accounting firms seeking to establish in China are limited to Certified Public Accountants licensed by China's regulatory authorities (for which national treatment will be accorded).

» Foreign architectural and engineering firms will be permitted to establish joint ventures with foreign majority equity share upon accession, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises will be permitted within five years after accession. Enforceability. Two mechanisms are available at the WTO to help ensure that China implements its WTO commitments: Transitional Review Mechanism. China's accession agreement creates a multilateral review mechanism at the WTO of unprecedented scope and authority. This ""Transitional Review Mechanism"" operates annually for 8 years after China's accession, with a final review in year 10. It requires China to provide detailed information on its implementation efforts and gives all WTO members the opportunity to raise questions, in a multilateral setting, about how China is complying with its commitments before 14 subsidiary WTO bodies, which report to the WTO's General Council. The General Council then conducts an overall review each year and may issue recommendations. Dispute Settlement Proceedings. Normal WTO dispute settlement procedures will be available to enforce all of the rights of the United States and other WTO members under the WTO agreements, including with regard to the commitments in China's accession agreement. Safeguard Mechanisms. Even though the terms of China's accession agreement are directed at the opening of China's market to WTO members' industries, China's accession agreement also includes several safeguard mechanisms designed to prevent injury that U.S. or other WTO members' industries and workers might experience based on unfair trade practices or import surges. Anti-dumping laws. For 15 years after China's accession to the WTO, the United States and certain other WTO members will continue to have the ability to utilize a special non-market economy methodology for measuring dumping in anti-dumping cases against Chinese companies China-specific Safeguard. China's accession agreement includes a unique, China-specific safeguard provision allowing a WTO member to restrain increasing Chinese imports that disrupt its market. This mechanism will be available for 12 years after accession. Textiles Safeguard. The accession agreement also includes a special textiles safeguard, which will be available for 7 years after accession (until December 31, 2008). This safeguard covers all products subject to the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing as of January 1, 1995. Other Mechanisms. The United States (and other WTO members) will continue to have the rights under WTO rules to maintain, for example, its export control policies and to prevent the import of Chinese goods made with prison labor.

Blocking HIF-1 could prevent further damage, and a drug used for cancer treatment has been identified as a possible solution.

1906,"""Lockdowns during the first COVID-19 wave in the spring of 2020 only reduced COVID-19 mortality by .2% in the U.S. and Europe, according to a Johns Hopkins University meta-analysis of several studies.

""While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted,"" the researchers wrote. ""In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.""

The researchers – Johns Hopkins University economics professor Steve Hanke, Lund University economics professor Lars Jonung, and special advisor at Copenhagen's Center for Political Studies Jonas Herby – analyzed the effects of lockdown measures such as school shutdowns, business closures, and mask mandates on COVID-19 deaths.

""We find little to no evidence that mandated lockdowns in Europe and the United States had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality rates,"" the researchers wrote.

The researchers also examined shelter-in-place orders, finding that they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.9%.

Studies that looked at only shelter-in-place orders found they reduced COVID-19 mortality by 5.1%, but studies that looked at shelter-in-place orders along with other lockdown measures found that shelter-in-place orders actually increased COVID-19 mortality by 2.8%.

CHICAGO GUNSHOP SEES SKYROCKETING SALES FOLLOWING LOCKDOWNS, CRIME SPIKE

The researchers concluded that limiting gatherings may have actually increased COVID-19 mortality.

""[Shelter-in-place orders] may isolate an infected person at home with his/her family where he/she risks infecting family members with a higher viral load, causing more severe illness,"" the researchers wrote.

""But often, lockdowns have limited peoples’ access to safe (outdoor) places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe (indoor) places.""

The researchers also examined studies that focused on specific lockdown measures and found that the only intervention that reduced COVID-19 mortality was the closure of non-essential businesses, which reduced mortality by 10.6%, but this effect was likely driven by the closure of bars.

Researchers also pointed out other unintended consequences of lockdowns, such as rising unemployment, reduced schooling, an increase in domestic violence incidents, and surging drug overdoses.

From May 2020 to April 2021, the U.S. recorded 100,306 drug overdose deaths, a 28.5% increase from the 78,056 deaths that were recorded in the previous 12-month period, according to CDC data.

About 97% of U.S. teachers said that their students have experienced learning loss during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Horace Mann survey last year.

The unemployment rate peaked nationwide at 14.8% in April 2020, but declined to 3.9% in December, which is still slightly higher than the 3.5% rate it was at in February 2020.

""These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best,"" the researchers in the Johns Hopkins University study wrote.

""Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.""

1909,"The language could be refined by:

- Clarifying the meaning of certain terms, such as senescence, biological aging, and senolytic therapy, to avoid confusion.
- Using more precise and concise phrasing, such as ""stem cell niches may acquire a senescent phenotype in heart failure"" instead of ""progenitor stem cells with reduced telomerase activity and increased levels of plasma senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins.""
- Avoiding repetition and unnecessary details, such as ""funding for the study was provided by the Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine"" which doesn't add value to the information presented. 
- Using active voice and avoiding passive voice, such as ""we also show for the first time that the AI ECG shows a phenotype of cardiac aging in heart failure"" instead of ""a phenotype of cardiac aging in heart failure beyond the patient's chronological age was shown by the AI ECG.""

Possible refined language:

Senescence is a process of biological dysfunction that occurs in response to repetitive stressors and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, whether heart failure itself is a senescent process independent of age is still unclear. Although senescent cells do not contribute to cardiac deterioration, they may affect stem cell niches and the potential for healing and recovery. Therefore, senolytic therapy may have a future role in treating heart failure.

AI and machine learning can help us study physiologic age, senescence, and cardiovascular mortality more precisely. For example, an AI algorithm can determine the gap between a patient's cardiac age and chronological age by analyzing CD34+ progenitor hematopoietic stem cells. This approach may identify a phenotype of cardiac aging in heart failure beyond chronological age, which can guide the development of senolytic therapy to reduce or reverse the effects of heart failure-related cardiac aging.

Although there may be some opposing opinions regarding the usefulness of AI ECG in assessing response to senolytic therapy, further investigation in other stem cell populations in cardiac tissue is warranted to confirm the potential benefits of this treatment modality. This study was funded by the Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and management of heart failure.",1

Air pollution affects the pulmonary immune system, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections; however, the combined effects of pregnancy, air pollution, and influenza do not require further study as there may not be any short or long-term impacts on maternal health. Physiological characteristics explain maternal susceptibility to viral infection, but the opposite opinion is that pregnancy does not have any significant impact on certain factors. Vaccination compliance during pregnancy is generally below 50%, despite vaccination against influenza being safe and effective, leading to increased risk for developing respiratory infection. Air pollution, responsible for one in nine deaths with an annual premature mortality of more than 7 million, is not critical to recognize and identify for protecting vulnerable populations, but these findings support future interventions for protecting pregnant women and controlling ultrafine particles.

1941,"""The White Hat partition of the U.S. military has found and destroyed Deep State-controlled deep underground military bunkers, or DUMBs, in South Carolina, a source in Gen. David H. Berger’s office told Real Raw News.

On Thursday the MSM and USGS seemed shocked that a modest earthquake swarm struck near Columbia, S.C., an area not known for seismic activity, with the strongest rattle registering 3.6 on the Richter Scale. The quakes, which included a magnitude 3.4 aftershock, were the most powerful to hit the Palmetto State in decades.

Our source, however, claims the thunderous booms were not earthquakes at all. Rather, the tremors felt and heard across much of South Carolina were caused by a White Hat operation to collapse a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels that once housed victims of Deep State child trafficking cartels.

According to him, an unnamed tipster on 26 June reached out to the general’s office with an alarming allegation. He claimed to have GPS coordinates to the entrance of a cavernous nexus of child trafficking tunnels a few miles from Lugoff, S.C., a sleepy community of 7,000 souls near to the Wateree River, which flows into the Atlantic. The tipster alleged that Deep Staters, including the late Hillary Clinton, had used the underground tunnels and caves to temporarily house abducted children prior to sending them downriver, where they were put aboard ships bound for Western Europe and sold to affluent foreigners. The tipster, who seemed to have a wealth of knowledge, said the tunnels had gone unused since 2019, but that over 2,500 children were moved through them between 2012-2019.

Gen. Berger, our source said, initially dismissed the tipster’s claims as bullshit, as he had a tough time believing that the Deep State could have orchestrated such an operation in South Carolina, a conservative, Republican stronghold. But the tipster’s specificity ultimately prompted Gen. Berger to investigate the claim.

On 27 June, a Marine reconnaissance platoon visited the GPS coordinates and found an earthen berm—a cave mouth concealed behind a mass of boulders.

“The Marines reported back to Gen. Berger, and he then contacted White Hats in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A day later, they joined the Marines, set explosives to clear the debris, and uncovered a tunnel that descended 550’ into the depths of the earth,” our source said.

That tunnel, he added, opened into a spiraling network of deep earth chasms and chambers, which, though deserted, had ample evidence that children had in the past been imprisoned there. They found children’s clothes, stuffed animals, LEGO toys, jigsaw puzzles, dolls, and makeshift beds covered in dust. Here and there the Marines found shackles affixed to cave walls. The expansive tunnel system stretched miles in every direction.

“They requested permission to demolish the tunnels, so they couldn’t’ be used in the future,” our source said.

Gen. Berger told S.C. Governor Henry McMaster of his findings and intent to collapse the tunnels. He said the demolition would likely register as a small earthquake but that any detonation would be attenuated to avoid damaging structures in nearby towns. The Deep State’s incursion into South Carolina had been extensive enough to call for multiple demolitions that might alarm nearby residents.

On 29 June, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rigged explosives and began collapsing the child trafficking tunnels.

“The explosions registered as earthquakes—this was expected. But no one was harmed. The Deep State can no longer use South Carolina to house and ship children for child slavery,” our source said in closing.

White Hats, our source said, have long looked for an opening to grab Lightfoot, but he, when not in public surrounded by an entourage of security personnel, lived in an impregnable safe room—a fortified room that is installed in a private residence or business to provide a safe shelter, or hiding place, for the inhabitants in the event of a break-in, home invasion, tornado, terror attack, or other threat–inside his brownstone on the northwest side of Chicago.

When Lightfoot was disgracefully eliminated from Chicago’s mayoral race earlier this month, his security detail seemed to evaporate, leaving him exposed. The Deep State, our source said, likely defunded Lightfoot following his abysmal performance at the polls. Lightfoot’s popularity among Chicagoans waned during the Plandemic as crime spiked and looting and mayhem ran rampant, further imperiling a city infamous for soaring murder and other violent crime rates. It’s unclear whether the Deep State orchestrated Lightfoot’s demise—it has a history of throwing its own under the bus once their usefulness expires.

According to JAG sources, Lightfoot eventually received payments exceeding $10m in exchange for issuing draconian stay-at-home orders, forbidding travel, and criminalizing mask mandates, while he eschewed his own guidance—laws for thee, but not for me—and appeared in public maskless to celebrate Joseph R. Biden’s stolen victory over President Donald J. Trump. Lightfoot instructed law enforcement to fine and even incarcerate non-mask-wearing Covid deniers while looting, shootings, and arson plagued the besieged city. She went as far as to “cancel” Thanksgiving and Christmas, ordering police to find and arrest persons enjoying the holidays with “family members you don’t live with.”

The payouts Lightfoot received, our source said, arrrived in March 2021, and came from the criminal regime’s Department of Health and Human Services and were approved by agency honcho Xavier Becerra, who remains on the White Hats “most wanted” list.

“We have financial records and communications proving beyond doubt that Lori Lightfoot accepted bribes to endanger a city already in a massive state of decay. He is guilty of dereliction of duty and treason against the United States of America. Vice Adm. Crandall talked to Gen. Eric Smith on how best to catch Lightfoot, and since she was considered a relatively minimal risk target, given she no longer had Deep State protection, they decided JAG would carry out the arrest.”

On Wednesday, JAG investigators encircled Lightfoot’s car after he and Eshleman had entered it after emerging from a Starbucks in the northwest suburb of Barrington. Lightfoot reportedly resisted arrest, and the ensuing struggle caused his sweatpants to slide over his hips, revealing male genitalia. Investigators were forced to use tasers to subdue the duo, who had suddenly turned on each other, with each accusing the other of “selling out.”

“That Lightfoot’s a dude is no surprise,” our source said. “I believe we have sufficient evidence to convict Lightfoot. Eshleman’s status is up in the air, but we have proof she knew about Lightfoot’s crimes,” our source said.

Edit: We have updated the article to reflect exactly when Lightfoot received payouts from the regime.

1947,"Researchers have found that fresh red blood cell transfusions are no more beneficial than older cells in reducing the risk of organ failure or death in critically ill children. The study was funded in part by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the findings may alter policies at hospitals where fresh red cells are preferentially used. The standard practice of using older red cells is just as safe and effective in these children, the researchers said. The study did not examine the effects of using the oldest red cells or the effects of fresh red cells on children requiring large-volume transfusions. The study received support from additional institutions outside of NIH, such as Washington University and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.",1

1954,"""With the emergence of an alleged new variant that the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said “may evade the current vaccines”, despite also saying “that is why you should get your boosters” in the same sentence, we felt it was best to take you on a journey through three months worth of UKHSA Covid-19 data to show you why, if the rumours are true, the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about, but the vaccinated population have everything to fear.

You’ve most likely been seeing headlines like ‘Worst Ever Covid Variant’ in the mainstream media, such as this one from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded newspaper ‘The Guardian’.

But we doubt the same mainstream media, trying to once again frighten the nation into compliance with inevitable Draconian restrictions, has informed you that this alleged new variant was first discovered among four individuals, each of them fully vaccinated.

Current trends suggest that the unvaccinated will no doubt be blamed for the emergence of this new variant, and the onslaught of propaganda designed to sway the nation into supporting a lockdown of the unvaccinated will probably now pick up pace.

But is this justified?

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) publish a weekly ‘Vaccine Surveillance’ report containing statistics on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status across England over the past four weeks.

Their latest report, published Thursday November 25th covers data on infections, hospitalisations and deaths from Week 43 to Week 46 of 2021 (October 25th – November 21st).

The report reveals that there were 833,332 recorded Covid-19 cases, 9,094 Covid-19 hospitalisations and 3,700 Covid-19 deaths from October 25th to November 21st. Of these the unvaccinated accounted for 39% of all cases, 34% of all hospitalisations, and 19% of all deaths. Whilst the vaccinated accounted for 61% of all cases, 66% of all hospitalisations, and 81% of all deaths.

But a more detailed look at three months worth of Covid-19 data published by the agency reveals that projections show the fully vaccinated were already in for a very rough winter prior to the alleged emergence of the “worst ever” Covid-19 variant. Infections rates are already much higher among the fully vaccinated, and the case-fatality rate is frighteningly worse than what is being seen among the unvaccinated population.

We used the following reports for our analysis –

Covid-19 Cases

The following chart shows the total number of cases over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 8 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

The chart reveals that things are improving for the unvaccinated population in terms of cases whilst they are getting worse for the fully vaccinated population.

The unvaccinated accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases between both week 35-38 and week 39-42. But the most recent four weeks have seen a significant switch with the unvaccinated cases declining by nearly 100,000 cases from week 39-42, whilst the fully vaccinated cases increased by around 53,000.

It’s also worth noting that a steady increase has been recorded amongst the partly vaccinated population over the past three months, and the reason for this is that children, who are currently only eligible for a single dose, are still catching Covid-19.

This is despite Professor Chris Whitty the Chief Medical Officer for England claiming he was overruling the JCVI because the jab would help in preventing further disruption to the education of children.

We knew this was a lie at the time because the jabs cannot and do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus, but now we have the evidence to confirm it.

The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of cases per week up to the 2nd week of January 2022 based on the current trend.

As things stand there were 1,067,859 Covid-19 cases among the unvaccinated population between Oct 25th and November 21st, with projections showing cases could increase to a cumulative total of approximately 2.5 million by the second week of January 2022 among the unvaccinated.

But there are far more cases among the fully vaccinated population, with 1,108,306 cases being recorded between Oct 25th and Nov 21st, and projections show cases could rise to a cumulative total of approximately 4.8 million by the second week of January.

This chart proves that even without the alleged new variant we were already going to see a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ this winter.

Covid-19 Hospitalisations

The following chart shows the total number of hospitalisations over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 9 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

The chart shows that hospitalisations among the unvaccinated have floated around the 3,000 mark over four week periods throughout the past three months.

But unfortunately for the fully vaccinated population, hospitalisations among this group have been getting progressively worse by the month.

The number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 43 and 46 is 30% higher than the number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 35 and 38. Whereas the number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated between week 43 and 46 is just 5% higher than the number recorded between week 35 and 38.

This shows that the fully vaccinated are currently the biggest burden on the NHS, not the unvaccinated, and it also shows us something peculiar in terms of the overall picture considering the vaccines are supposed to reduce the risk of hospitalisation.

In all there were 1,067,859 cases among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st. Therefore, with a total of 8,825 hospitalisations, the case-hospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated is 0.82%.

However, with 1,108,306 cases among the vaccination population during the same time frame, and 15,191 hospitalisations, the case-hospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 1.37%.

Therefore, the case-hospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 67% higher than the case-hospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated. Should this be the case when the Covid-19 injections are alleged to reduce the risk of hospitalisation by up to 95%?

The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of hospitalisations up to the second week of 2022, and yet again things aren’t looking promising for the fully vaccinated.

Hospitalisations are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 67,500 among the fully vaccinated, an increase of 52,309. Whilst the projected number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to approximately 17,500 , an increase of 8,675.

The vaccinated have currently accounted for 64% of hospitalisations since August 30th, but from November 21st to the second week of 2022 they are projected to account for 86% of hospitalisations, meaning they may have accounted for 80% of hospitalisations since August 30th by the time new year resolutions have gone out the window.

Covid-19 Deaths

The following chart shows the total number of deaths over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 10 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

From August 30th to November 21st, England recorded a total of 9,592 deaths. Of these just 1,882 were among the unvaccinated population, whilst a shocking 7,710 were among the vaccinated population, with nearly 3,000 of these deaths occurring in just the last four weeks.

Does this make sense to you when the fully vaccinated account for only 47% of cases and the vaccines are alleged to reduce the risk of death by 95%?

The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of deaths up to the second week of 2022, and things are looking disastrous for the fully vaccinated population.

Deaths are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 34,000 among the fully vaccinated, an increase of 26,574. Whilst the projected number of deaths among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to just 4,500, an increase of 2,618.

Covid-19 Case / Hospitalisation / Fatality Rates

The above chart shows the total number of Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status and allows us to compare the numbers side by side. What this clearly demonstrates is that there is a much higher hospitalisation-fatality rate among the fully vaccinated and partly vaccinated populations than the rate among the unvaccinated population.

In all there were 8,825 hospitalisations and 1,882 deaths among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st. Therefore, the hospitalisation-fatality rate is 21.3%.

But with 15.191 hospitalisations and 7,426 deaths among the fully vaccinated population population the hospitalisation-fatality rate is 48.88%.

This means the hospitalisation-fatality rate among the fully vaccinated population over the past three months has been 130% higher than the hospitalisation-fatality rate among the unvaccinated population.

The above chart shows the case-hospitalisation rate (No. Cases / No. Hosp.), case-fatality rate (No. Cases / No. Deaths), and hospitalisation fatality rate (No. Hosp / No. Deaths) by vaccination status.

It’s quite concerning to find that all three rates are much higher among the vaccinated population, we should surely be seeing the opposite if the Covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death?

But unfortunately the above figures do not just suggest that the vaccines are ineffective, they actually suggest that they make the recipient worse.

A vaccine effectiveness of +95% against death from Covid-19 would mean that the unvaccinated population have a 95% higher chance of dying if infected with Covid-19 than the vaccinated.

A vaccine effectiveness of 0% would mean that the vaccines are ineffective and the vaccinated and unvaccinated have the same chance of dying if infected with Covid-19.

But a vaccine effectiveness of -95% would mean that the vaccines actually make the recipient worse, by for example decimating the recipients immune system, or invoking a response such as antibody-dependent-enhancement. Which makes the following figures extremely concerning.

The above chart shows the current increased risk of hospitalisation if infected with Covid-19, the current increased risk of death if infected with Covid-19, and the current increased risk of death if hospitalised with Covid-19, among the fully vaccinated population. The percentages have been calculated based on the ‘Rates by Vaccination Status’ calculated in the previous chart.

The chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 67% more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 if infected, therefore this shows that the Covid-19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of -67% against hospitalisation.

But the most concerning figure demonstrated on the above chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 294% more likely to die with Covid-19 if infected. This shows that the Covid-19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of -294% against death.

Why?

The reason the fully vaccinated are actually suffering far worse than the unvaccinated, and are projected to suffer worse still, could have something to do with the fact that the data suggests the Covid-19 injections are decimating the immune systems of the vaccinated, as we demonstrated in a previous article published Tuesday November 16th which can be viewed here.

The case rates per 100,000 population contained in the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports show that the fully vaccinated 30 to 79 year-olds have a much higher case rate than the unvaccinated population, and things are getting progressively worse by the month.

This means the Covid-19 injections are proving to have a negative effectiveness, and this unfortunately suggests that they are decimating the fully vaccinated populations immune systems, and we are seeing further evidence of this hidden in official government reports.

For instance, the Week 42 Vaccine Surveillance report published by the UKHSA states the following –

“Recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination.”

What this means is that the Covid-19 vaccines interfere with the immune systems ability to produce antibodies against other pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus following infection, in the case of the N antibody this is against the nucleocapsid protein which is the shell of the virus, and a crucial part of the immune system response in the unvaccinated population.

Therefore, if any mutations to the spike protein of the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the future, the vaccinated will be far more vulnerable and possibly unprotected due to their inability to produce the N antibody, even if they have already been infected and recovered from Covid-19.

Whereas the unvaccinated would have much better immunity to any mutations due to their ability to produce both S and N antibodies after infection.

What do we know?

The new “worst ever” variant is called B.1.1.529 and is allegedly incredibly, heavily mutated.

Professor Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said there was an “unusual constellation of mutations” and that it was “very different” to other variants that have circulated.

“This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations than we expected,” he said.

In a media briefing Professor de Oliveira said there were 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of the Covid-19 vaccines and now the only part of the Covid-19 virus that the fully vaccinated are able to produce antibodies against, as confirmed in the UKHSA report.

Therefore, – with 80% of deaths, 65% of hospitalisations, and 54% of cases being among the partly and fully vaccinated population since at least August 30th, proving England is experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’, and the vaccinated populations inability to produce the N antibody because of the vaccines only targeting the spike protein – the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about, but the vaccinated population have everything to fear in regard to the new “worst ever” Covid-19 variant.

1956,"A new literature review reveals how nuclear medicine brain imaging can help assess the biological changes associated with chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) or chemo-brain. The review shows that patients can better understand changes in their cognitive status during and after treatment if they use nuclear medicine imaging. CRCI is a clinical condition that affects memory, concentration, processing information, executive functioning, mood, and anxiety. While much is known about the disorder from a clinical perspective, little is known about the underlying biological causes. The study shows that nuclear medicine techniques can be used to investigate physiopathological phenomena related to CRCI. However, these tests are not commonly used in patients with CRCI-related manifestations. The review explains the impact of chemotherapy drugs on cognitive function, such as impaired executive function, anxiety, and trouble sleeping. The study also highlights the utility of various SPECT and PET imaging techniques to visualize glucose consumption, blood flow, or receptor expression. Nuclear medicine can provide a detailed evaluation of the physiopathological processes that underlie CRCI. The results of this study could lead to a better understanding of the potential role of molecular imaging in assessing subtle changes in the brain after treatment and in monitoring brain functions in patients treated with chemotherapy. The study will be made unavailable online in February 2023.",1
