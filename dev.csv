The FDA revised the drug’s emergency use authorization on Wednesday, letting state-licensed pharmacists screen patients and determine if they are eligible for Paxlovid, according to The Associated Press.

Previously, only doctors could prescribe the antiviral drug, the AP reported. With some limits, pharmacists can now prescribe the medication for patients who face high risks for severe COVID-19.

“The FDA recognizes the important role pharmacists have played and continue to play in combatting this pandemic,” Patrizia Cavazzoni, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

“Since Paxlovid must be taken within five days after symptoms begin, authorizing state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid could expand access to timely treatment for some patients who are eligible to receive this drug for the treatment of COVID-19,” she said.

Tom Kraus, the vice president of government relations at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, said in a statement that the organization was “pleased to see the FDA remove this barrier to patients’ access to this critical treatment.”",0
1,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — More than 107,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. Sadly, 20 people die every day while waiting for a lifesaving transplant. Mayo Clinic recently launched an online campaign with the goal of registering 600 more people to be organ donors.

""While 95 percent of Americans say they are in favor of being an organ donor, only 58 percent are registered,"" says Dr. J.P. Scott, medical director of Mayo Clinic's William J. von Liebig Transplant Center in Rochester. ""It only takes a few minutes to register online or check the box on a driver's license application to become a registered donor. This simple and generous act of letting one's wishes be known has the potential to truly save lives.""

April is National Donate Life Month, which encourages people to register to be organ, eye and tissue donors, and honor those who have given the gift of life. In addition to encouraging people to register to become organ donors, Mayo Clinic has several other activities planned this month to raise awareness about the need for organ donation. They include:
• Raising the Donate Life flag at both the Mayo Clinic Hospitals – Rochester, Saint Marys Campus and Methodist Campus Monday, April 12.
• Lighting the Plummer Building in downtown Rochester blue and green in honor of National Donate Life Blue and Green Day on Friday, April 16. Some Mayo Clinic Health System locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin will also be lighting their buildings. On Blue and Green Day, individuals are encouraged to wear blue and green to promote the importance of registering to be an organ donor.
• Mayo Clinic Transplant Center will join LifeSource and the Gift of Life Transplant House in hosting a virtual ""Walk of Remembrance"" tribute to organ, eye and tissue donors and their families on April 30 as part of National Donor Day. In addition, luminarias lit blue and green will be placed along 2nd Street Southwest between Saint Marys Hospital and Gift of Life Transplant House.

Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant provider in the nation. Every year, Mayo Clinic surgeons perform more than 2,000 solid organ and bone marrow transplants in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. Mayo Clinic has both adult and pediatric transplant programs, offering heart, liver, kidney, lung, hand, face and blood and bone marrow transplant services.

3,"June 10, 2022 -- Infants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the womb are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in the first year of life, new research suggests. But whether it is exposure to the pandemic or maternal exposure to the virus itself that may harm early childhood neurodevelopment is unclear, caution investigators, led by Roy Perlis, MD, with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""In this analysis of 222 offspring of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared with the offspring of 7,550 mothers in the control group (not infected) delivered during the same period, we observed neurodevelopmental diagnoses to be significantly more common among exposed offspring, particularly those exposed to third-trimester maternal infection,"" they write. The study was published online June 9 in JAMA Network Open. The study included 7,772 mostly singleton live births across six hospitals in Massachusetts between March and September 2020, including 222 (2.9%) births to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during pregnancy. In all, 14 of 222 children born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers (6.3%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder in the first year of life vs 227 of 7550 unexposed offspring (3%). When factors such as preterm delivery, race, ethnicity, insurance status, child sex, and the mother's age were taken into account, COVID-exposed babies were significantly more likely to receive a neurodevelopmental diagnosis in the first year of life. The association with neurodevelopmental disorders was even greater with third-trimester SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of these diagnoses reflected developmental disorders of movement or speech and language. The researchers note the finding of an association between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and neurodevelopmental diagnoses at 12 months are in line with a ""large body of literature"" linking maternal viral infection and the mother's immune response with infants' neurodevelopmental disorders later in life. They caution, however, that whether a definitive connection exists between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and adverse neurodevelopment in babies is not yet known, in part because children born to women infected in the first wave of the pandemic haven't reached their second birthday, a time when neurodevelopment disorders such as autism are typically diagnosed.

There is also the chance that the findings could be biased because infected mothers who were ill during pregnancy may be more inclined to seek medical evaluation, and clinicians may be more inclined to diagnose or refer them for evaluation, the researchers note. Nonetheless, the study results support those of research released in a similar study at the European Psychiatric Association 2022 Congress. Those results also showed an association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired neurodevelopment in 6-week-old infants. In an accompanying commentary, Torri D. Metz, MD, with the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City, says the preliminary findings of Perlis and colleagues are ""critically important, yet many questions remain."" ""Essentially all of what we know now about the effects of in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is from children who were exposed to the early and Alpha variants of SARS-CoV-2, as those are the only children now old enough to undergo rigorous neurodevelopmental assessments,"" Metz points out. Ultimately, Metz says it's not surprising that the pandemic and in utero exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection may adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children. Yet, since this type of study only looks at data from the past, it can only show associations, not cause and effect. ""This type of work is intended to be hypothesis-generating, and that goal has been accomplished as these preliminary findings generate numerous additional research questions to explore,"" Metz writes. Among them: Are there genetic predispositions to adverse outcomes? Will we observe different effects depending upon which SARS-CoV-2 variant the mother was infected by, by the severity of her infection, and by trimester of infection? Is it the virus itself or all of the societal changes that occurred during this period, including differences in how those changes were experienced among those with and without SARS-CoV-2? ""Perhaps the most important question is how do we intervene to help mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on young children,"" Metz notes. Studies where the mothers are followed and observed over a period of time are needed ""to validate these findings, tease out some of the nuance, and identify those at highest risk,"" she adds.",0

6,"Parkinson's is the most common, chronic neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting 1% of the global population over seventy years of age. Right now, there is no cure for this disease and the available treatments focus on addressing its symptoms but not its progression.

Although most cases of Parkinson's are sporadic, the inheritable variants of the disease are mainly associated with mutations of the gene that encodes the LRRK2 enzyme. In 2004 an international research team, in which researchers from the Basque Country participated, established the link between one of the mutations in this enzyme and patients diagnosed with the disease.

So the LRRK2 enzyme, which is also known internationally by the name ""dardarina,"" the Basque word that means tremor, has become one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for developing new drugs to combat inheritable Parkinson's. Neurotoxicity, or the pathogenic effects as a whole associated with LRRK2, is mainly due to the fact that pathogenic mutations increase the kinase activity of this enzyme, which has prompted an international race to develop inhibitors. Right now, specific, powerful inhibitors of the kinase activity of LRRK2 do in fact exist. Yet many of them cause undesirable side effects or produce very unclear clinical results.

This research conducted by Iban Ubarretxena, the Ikerbasque researcher and director of the Biofisika Institute (mixed centre of the CSIC-Spanish National Research Council and the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country) at the UPV/EHU's Science Park (Leioa-Erandio Area), together with an international research team, has revealed that AdoCbl, one of the active forms of vitamin B12, acts as an inhibitor of the kinase activity of LRRK2 in cultured cells and brain tissue. It also significantly prevents the neurotoxicity of the LRRK2 variants associated with Parkinson's in cultured cells of primary rodents, as well as in various genetically modified models used to study this disease. The results of the research have been published in the journal Cell Research.

So according to the study, vitamin B12 has turned out to be a new class of modulator of the kinase activity of LRRK2, which, as Iban Ubarretxena pointed out, ""constitutes a huge step forward because it is a neuroprotective vitamin in animal models and has a mechanism unlike that of currently existing inhibitors. So it could be used as a basis to develop new therapies to combat hereditary Parkinson's associated with pathogenic variants of the LRRK2 enzyme.""",0

The band announced the cancellation in a statement, saying Jagger, 78, tested positive “after experiencing symptoms of COVID upon arrival at the stadium,” which is on the outskirts of Amsterdam. No additional details were available about his condition.

“The Rolling Stones are deeply sorry for tonight’s postponement, but the safety of the audience, fellow musicians and the touring crew has to take priority,” the statement said.

Some fans were already in Amsterdam’s Johan Cruijff Arena when the cancelation was announced about an hour and a half before the concert was scheduled to begin, according to Reuters. The show will be rescheduled, and the tickets will be honored for the new date.

“I’m so sorry that we’ve had to postpone the Amsterdam show with such short notice tonight,” Jagger wrote in a Twitter post.

12,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily kills motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death 2 to 5 years from diagnosis. Currently ALS has no cure. Despite promising early-stage research, the majority of drugs in development for ALS have failed. Now researchers have uncovered a possible explanation. In a study published November 20th in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, researchers show that the brain's machinery for pumping out toxins is ratcheted up in ALS patients and that this machinery also pumps out medicine designed to treat ALS, thereby decreasing the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. The work showed that when these pumps are blocked, the drug becomes more effective at slowing the progression of the disease in mouse models.

""This mechanism that normally protects the brain and the spinal cord from damage via environmental toxins, also treats the therapeutic drug as a threat and pumps that out as well"" says co-senior author Piera Pasinelli, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and Co-Director of the Weinberg Unit for ALS Research at Thomas Jefferson University. ""Blocking the pumps, or transporter proteins, improved how well the ALS drug worked in mice.""

""Drug resistance via these types of cellular drug-pumps is not new,"" says co-senior author Davide Trotti, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and Co-Director of the Weinberg Unit for ALS research at Jefferson. ""In fact, drug companies routinely check novel compounds for interactions with these transporter proteins, but they typically check in healthy animals or individuals."" Because of the investigators' background in pharmacological sciences and ALS research, examining the role of drug transporter proteins made sense. But rather than look at healthy mice, the researcher looked at how these interactions changed in mouse models of the disease over time.

In research published earlier, the group showed that the function of the pumps changed as the disease progressed in mice, with the pumps becoming more active as the symptoms became more severe. ""The ALS brain and spinal cord may be trying to compensate for the disease by generating more of these pumps,"" says Dr. Trotti. But it was unclear whether this increase would really impact treatment.

To address this question, the investigators led by Drs. Pasinelli and Trotti, tested in the mouse model of ALS the only drug approved for ALS treatment and used by patients, riluzole. Earlier work had shown that the drug loses its effectiveness in patients as the disease progresses, and overall the drug only prolongs survival of ALS patients by 3-6 months. The researchers also chose riluzole because they knew it interacted with two pumps, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast-cancer resistant protein (BCRP -- first discovered for its role in drug resistance in breast cancer). These two pumps can be selectively blocked by an experimental compound called elacridar that leaves other pumps in the brain unaffected.

The team treated mice with the combination of the ALS drug (riluzole) and pump-blocker (elacridar) and showed that the combination extended the life span of mice compared with those treated only with riluzole. Importantly, the combination also alleviated some of the symptoms, improving muscle-strength and other measures in mice.

Unlike most experiments in ALS mice, in which drugs are administered before the mice exhibit symptoms of the disease in an attempt to delay onset, Pasinelli and Trotti tested their hypothesis in a model that mirrored what patients actually experience, with treatment beginning when ALS symptoms become apparent. Treating ALS mice with riluzole when symptoms appear actually provides little to no benefit alone, but together with elacridar, showed marked improvements.

""The fact that elacridar is selective may explain why we didn't see obvious side effects: other transporter proteins in the brain were still active and removing toxins. We simply plugged the ones that allowed riluzole to leak out,"" said Pasinelli.

The finding may also explain why ALS drugs that appear to work initially, fail as the disease progresses: as the motor neurons become more damaged, the brain creates more pumps to try to remove the damage, also removing ALS drugs with greater efficiency than before.

""The research paves a way for improving the efficacy of an already ALS approved drug, if the findings hold true in human clinical trials,"" says Dr. Pasinelli. ""But more importantly it also sheds light on a basic pathological mechanism at play in ALS patients that might explain why so many treatments have failed, and suggests a way to re-examine these therapies together with selective pump-inhibitor.""",0
13,"A collection of photos of genetically unrelated lookalikes, along with DNA analysis, revealed that strong facial similarity is associated with shared genetic variants. The work appears August 23 in the journal Cell Reports.

""Our study provides a rare insight into human likeness by showing that people with extreme lookalike faces share common genotypes, whereas they are discordant at the epigenome and microbiome levels,"" says senior author Manel Esteller of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. ""Genomics clusters them together, and the rest sets them apart.""

The number of people identified online as virtual twins or doubles who are genetically unrelated has increased due to the expansion of the World Wide Web and the possibility of exchanging pictures of humans across the planet. In the new study, Esteller and his team set out to characterize, on a molecular level, random human beings that objectively share facial features.

To do so, they recruited human doubles from the photographic work of François Brunelle, a Canadian artist who has been obtaining worldwide pictures of lookalikes since 1999. They obtained headshot pictures of 32 lookalike couples. The researchers determined an objective measure of likeness for the pairs using three different facial recognition algorithms.

In addition, the participants completed a comprehensive biometric and lifestyle questionnaire and provided saliva DNA for multiomics analysis. ""This unique set of samples has allowed us to study how genomics, epigenomics, and microbiomics can contribute to human resemblance,"" Esteller says.

Overall, the results revealed that these individuals share similar genotypes, but differ in their DNA methylation and microbiome landscapes. Half of the lookalike pairs were clustered together by all three algorithms. Genetic analysis revealed that 9 of these 16 pairs clustered together, based on 19,277 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Moreover, physical traits such as weight and height, as well as behavioral traits such as smoking and education, were correlated in lookalike pairs. Taken together, the results suggest that shared genetic variation not only relates to similar physical appearance, but may also influence common habits and behavior.

""We provided a unique insight into the molecular characteristics that potentially influence the construction of the human face,"" Esteller says. ""We suggest that these same determinants correlate with both physical and behavioral attributes that constitute human beings.""

A few study limitations include the small sample size, the use of 2D black-and-white images, and the predominance of European participants. Despite these caveats, the findings may provide a molecular basis for future applications in various fields such as biomedicine, evolution, and forensics.

""These results will have future implications in forensic medicine -- reconstructing the criminal's face from DNA -- and in genetic diagnosis -- the photo of the patient's face will already give you clues as to which genome he or she has,"" Esteller says. ""Through collaborative efforts, the ultimate challenge would be to predict the human face structure based on the individual's multiomics landscape.""

14,"We tend to eat, drink, and move less when we're feeling under the weather. And we're not alone -- most animals reduce those same three behaviors when they're fighting an infection.

Now, a new study pinpoints the cluster of neurons that control these responses, referred to as sickness behaviors. By provoking immune responses in mice, researchers demonstrated that a specific population of cells in the brainstem potently induce three telltale sickness behaviors. In addition, inhibiting these neurons blunts each of these behavioral elements of the sickness response. The findings, published in Nature, directly link inflammation to neural pathways regulating behavior, offering insight into how the immune system interacts with the brain.

""We are still in the early days of trying to understand the brain's role in infection,"" says Jeffrey M. Friedman, Marilyn M. Simpson Professor at The Rockefeller University. ""But with these results, we now have a unique opportunity to ask: What does your brain look like when you're sick?""

Sickness behaviors have been shown to play an important role in an animal's recovery from an infection. Prior studies have bolstered that theory by demonstrating that animals forced to eat when they're sick showed a significantly increased mortality. ""These behavioral changes during infection are really important for survival,"" says lead author Anoj Ilanges, a former graduate student in Friedman's lab, now a group leader at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus

But it has never been clear how the brain coordinates that near-universal urge to refuse meals and curl up under the covers with the onset of infection. So Friedman and Ilanges set out to map the brain regions behind sickness behaviors in mice.

The team began by exposing mice to LPS, a piece of bacterial cell wall that activates the immune system and potently induces sickness behavior. Shortly after an injection of LPS, there was a spike in activity in a brainstem region known as the dorsal vagal complex, among a population of neurons expressing the neuropeptide ADCYAP1. To confirm that they had found the right brain cells, the researchers then activated those neurons in healthy mice and they found that the animals ate, drank, and moved around less. In contrast, when the ADCYAP1 neurons were deactivated , the effect of LPS on these behaviors was significantly reduced.

""We didn't know if the same or different neurons regulated each of these behaviors,"" Friedman says, ""We found it surprising that a single neuronal population appears to regulate each of these components of the sickness response.""

The authors were not, however, altogether surprised that this brainstem region was involved in mediating sickness behaviors. The dorsal vagal complex is one of a precious few physiological crossroads of the central nervous system, where an absence of the blood brain barrier enables circulating factors in the blood to pass information directly to the brain. ""This region has emerged as a kind of alert center for the brain, conveying information about aversive or noxious substances that, more often than not, reduce food intake,"" Friedman says.

In the coming months, Friedman's team at Rockefeller intends to incorporate these findings into their overall goal of understanding the physiological signals and neural circuitry that regulate feeding behavior. They are specifically interested in understanding why even mice engineered to eat voraciously will nonetheless stop eating when exposed to bacterial infections.

Meanwhile, Ilanges plans to investigate what role other brain regions play in response to infections, expanding our knowledge of the brain's role during this critical process. ""We looked at one region of the brain, but there are many others that become activated with the immune response,"" he says. ""This opens the door to asking what the brain is doing, holistically, during infection.""",0

16,"Consuming higher amounts of Vitamin D -- mainly from dietary sources -- may help protect against developing young-onset colorectal cancer or precancerous colon polyps, according to the first study to show such an association.

The study, recently published online in the journal Gastroenterology, by scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and other institutions, could potentially lead to recommendations for higher vitamin D intake as an inexpensive complement to screening tests as a colorectal cancer prevention strategy for adults younger than age 50.

While the overall incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining, cases have been increasing in younger adults -- a worrisome trend that has yet to be explained. The authors of the study, including senior co-authors Kimmie Ng, MD, MPH, of Dana-Farber, and Edward Giovannucci, MD, DSc., of the T.H. Chan School, noted that vitamin D intake from food sources such as fish, mushrooms, eggs, and milk has decreased in the past several decades. There is growing evidence of an association between vitamin D and risk of colorectal cancer mortality. However, prior to the current study, no research has examined whether total vitamin D intake is associated with the risk of young-onset colorectal cancer.

""Vitamin D has known activity against colorectal cancer in laboratory studies. Because vitamin D deficiency has been steadily increasing over the past few years, we wondered whether this could be contributing to the rising rates of colorectal cancer in young individuals,"" said Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber. ""We found that total vitamin D intake of 300 IU per day or more -- roughly equivalent to three 8-oz. glasses of milk -- was associated with an approximately 50% lower risk of developing young-onset colorectal cancer.""

The results of the study were obtained by calculating the total vitamin D intake -- both from dietary sources and supplements -- of 94,205 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II). This study is a prospective cohort study of nurses aged 25 to 42 years that began in 1989. The women are followed every two years by questionnaires on demographics, diet and lifestyle factors, and medical and other health-related information. The researchers focused on a primary endpoint -- young-onset colorectal cancer, diagnosed before 50 years of age. They also asked on a follow-up questionnaire whether they had had a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy where colorectal polyps (which may be precursors to colorectal cancer) were found.

During the period from 1991 to 2015 the researchers documented 111 cases of young-onset colorectal cancer and 3,317 colorectal polyps. Analysis showed that higher total vitamin D intake was associated with a significantly reduced risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. The same link was found between higher vitamin D intake and risk of colon polyps detected before age 50.

The association was stronger for dietary vitamin D -- principally from dairy products -- than from vitamin D supplements. The study authors said that finding could be due to chance or to unknown factors that are not yet understood.

Interestingly, the researchers didn't find a significant association between total vitamin D intake and risk of colorectal cancer diagnosed after age 50. The findings were not able to explain this inconsistency, and the scientists said further research in a larger sample is necessary to determine if the protective effect of vitamin D is actually stronger in young-onset colorectal cancer.

In any case, the investigators concluded that higher total vitamin D intake is associated with decreased risks of young-onset colorectal cancer and precursors (polyps). ""Our results further support that vitamin D may be important in younger adults for health and possibly colorectal cancer prevention,"" said Ng. ""It is critical to understand the risk factors that are associated with young-onset colorectal cancer so that we can make informed recommendations about diet and lifestyle, as well as identify high risk individuals to target for earlier screening.""

The study was funded by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense; by the American Cancer Society Mentored Research Scholar Grant; and by the Project P Fund.

17,"The drink “Proffee” (protein powder mixed with coffee) has been gaining popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, with people claiming it can provide a healthy energy boost and aid with weight loss. Lauren Lee/Stocksy United
• Proffee, a blend of coffee and protein, is a recent TikTok trend causing a stir among experts.
• Some dietitians and nutritionists say there are better ways to add caffeine and protein to your diet.
• Experts also believe there are ways to make proffee healthier but that it’s typically fine in moderation. There’s a new trend brewing on TikTok. It’s called “proffee” and the hashtag #proffee has already received nearly 10 million views on the social media platform. “In the TikTok world, where proffee has taken off, this usually means a protein shake poured over a cold brew or iced coffee, but in actuality, it can be any type of coffee with protein added,” says Carolyn Cohen, an integrative nutritionist, functional medicine health coach, and host of the podcast Wellness While Walking. The dramatic slow-motion videos, which end with a creamy beverage in a glass jar, make it look fun and delicious. And some TikTok users are swearing by its benefits, including weight loss. But do the health claims really shake out? Experts spilled on what you need to know before trying this made-for-social-media beverage.

Some of the most popular purported benefits of proffee swirling around include: But experts offer mixed reviews on these claims. Noah Quezada, RDN, says that proffee can be energizing and improve focus and performance because of the caffeine content. of seven males who underwent a cycling-based exercise test suggested that caffeine increased time to exhaustion by 12 percent. from 2016 of 12 males indicated that moderate caffeine consumption before and during a round of golf improved subjective energy levels and performance while lowering fatigue. That said, it’s important to note that these studies were not done on proffee itself. Dan Gallagher, a registered dietitian with Aegle Nutrition, says there are better ways to get a jolt. “Healthier sources of caffeine would be black or green tea or simply a cup of coffee,” Gallagher says. suggested that protein intake could boost metabolic health and longevity. Patricia Kolesa, MS, RDN of Hackensack Meridian Health notes that the recommended dietary intake is 0.8g/kg of body weight per day. In other words, a 150-pound person would need about 54 grams of protein per day. For context, weighing 174 grams (6.13 oz.) contains about 55 grams of protein. Kolesa says the protein in shakes can contribute to this protein intake but notes that most people can get enough protein from food. And Gallagher says food is a better protein source. “Protein is healthiest when it’s sourced from whole ingredients like seafood, lean beef, beans, eggs, or milk,” Gallagher says. “Maintaining a balanced diet will give all the advertised benefits and more.” Part of the issue is that protein shakes can have added sugars or low quality, processed proteins that don’t measure up to the natural proteins found in foods. “Any health benefits of adding protein to coffee can be quickly undone by the window-dressing — the devil is in the details when it comes to proffee,” Cohen says. Weight loss is one of the most commonly discussed benefits of proffee. Quezada encourages people to proceed with caution. “Proffee is not a miracle weight-loss drink,” Quezada says. That said, Quezada notes that some evidence suggests that caffeine and protein can aid some people in weight management. For example, a of 12 studies indicated that drinking coffee reduced body fat, especially in male participants. suggested it could lower body fat in women. indicated that adhering to a high protein diet could be an effective way to lose weight and prevent obesity. But Kolesa stresses that there are no studies on proffee itself. “It is not a guarantee that the protein coffee itself will help someone lose weight,” she says. And she adds pouring in high fat milk, creamers and sugary syrups can negate any benefits from the beverage’s protein and caffeine.

Ultimately, Quezada stresses that meeting weekly exercise requirements and following a nutritious diet of lean animal and plant-based protein, produce, and complex carbohydrates are more proven ways for individuals to get the benefits of proffee. Kolesa says going this route can help people avoid some cons of drinking proffee, including: The exact number of cups of coffee a person can handle isn’t an exact science — it will vary based on the individual. If you notice you are jittery or having trouble sleeping, consider reducing the amount. But Kolesa says the that most healthy adults can consume 400 mg. of caffeine daily or four to five cups of coffee. However, she says pregnant and lactating people should consume less. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests individuals limit caffeine intake to 200 mg., or one 12-oz. cup of coffee, per day during pregnancy. that a small amount of caffeine passes through breastmilk but says adverse effects, such as poor sleep and irritability, are not typically seen if the lactating person consumes 300 mg. of caffeine, or two to three cups of coffee, daily. The syrups and high fat milk and creamers some TikTokers are putting in their beverages may not be best for people with diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart conditions. “You could try using low sugar syrups or protein shakes/powders,” Kolesa suggests. “You can also try low fat creamers and milk.” An older 2013 study suggested that consuming caffeine six hours before bedtime could disrupt sleep. Kolesa also suggests reading the labels of protein shakes to ensure you are not allergic to any ingredients. Other ingredients may not trigger allergic reactions but could lead to GI issues, like stomach aches. If you notice you’re having those issues, stop using the shake.

Gallagher says proffee isn’t off the table, but it shouldn’t be considered a meal replacement or your primary source of protein or caffeine. “If you’re looking for something tasty, this is probably worth drinking, but I would look at it essentially as a blended drink from Starbucks,” Gallagher says. “It’s probably not something to have daily.” And he stresses it’s essential to rely on advice from healthcare providers and peer-reviewed studies, not TikTokers, for dietary advice. “I would approach nutrition and wellness trends on TikTok with a healthy dose of skepticism,” Gallagher says. “Research, but be wary of what sites are advertising benefits. It’s good to question what biases sites might have, and when in doubt, research scientific studies or medical organizations specifically.”",0

19,"Pregnant women who take extra choline supplements may mitigate the negative impact that viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, can have on their babies, according to a new study from researchers in the Departments of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Choline is a vitamin B nutrient found in various foods and dietary supplements, and is critical to fetal brain development.

""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicts that COVID-19 will impact fetal brain development like other common corona respiratory viruses,"" said Robert Freedman, MD, professor of psychiatry at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus and lead researcher.

The new study, published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, specifically looked at whether higher prenatal choline levels can help protect the fetus's developing brain even if the mother contracts a viral respiratory infection in early pregnancy. The results reveal higher prenatal choline levels mitigate the fetal impact of virus infection.

""It's important for the healthcare community, and soon to be mothers, to be aware that a natural nutrient can be taken during pregnancy, just like folic acid and other prenatal vitamins, to protect fetuses and newborns from brain development issues. Later on in life, these development issues can lead to mental illness,"" Freedman adds.

In the study, researchers analyzed the effects on infant behavior if the mother had contracted a respiratory virus by measuring the infant's IBQ-R Regulation dimension -- which looks at the development of infant attention and other self-regulatory behaviors. Lower IBQ-R Regulation at one year of age is associated with problems in attention and social behavior in later childhood, including decreased reading readiness at age four years and with problems in concentration, and conscientiousness in children through seven years of age.

The results from the study:
• Infants of mothers who had viral infections and higher choline levels had significantly increased 3-month IBQ-R scores on the Regulation dimension and specifically the Attention scale in the Regulation dimension, compared to infants of mothers who had viral infections and had lower choline levels.
• Choline levels sufficient to protect the fetus often require dietary supplements.
• The increased maternal anxiety and depression in the viral-infected mothers were not associated with their infants' IBQ-R Regulation.

The study highlights that in conjunction with the CDC's current advice on COVID-19's effects in pregnancy, phosphatidylcholine or choline supplements along with other prenatal vitamins may help buffer the fetal brain from the possible detrimental impact of the current pandemic and decrease the risk of the children's future mental illness.

""Previous pandemics have resulted in significantly increased levels of mental illnesses including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit disorder in the offspring,"" said Camille Hoffman, MD, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. ""However, since data from COVID-19 itself will not be available for years, we're hoping our study findings will provide valuable information for soon to be mothers on the importance of taking choline supplements daily during pregnancy.""",0

21,"Analysis of individuals with rare, molecularly defined defects in the signaling pathway activated by the hormone insulin (which controls blood glucose levels), by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, has provided new insight that might be applicable to the many individuals with obesity-related resistance to insulin, something that predisposes individuals to type 2 diabetes.

The importance of such studies and the questions that they raise are discussed in an accompanying commentary by Robert Hegele and Karen Reue.

The team, led by Robert Semple and David Savage, found that patients with generalized resistance to insulin because they either carry mutations in the insulin receptor gene or have inhibitory antibodies that bind the insulin receptor, have low levels of fats known as triglycerides in their blood and normal levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL cholesterol).

By contrast, two patients with mutations in the AKT2 gene, which generates a protein that is part of one of the signaling pathways activated when insulin binds the insulin receptor, were found to have increased levels of triglycerides in their blood and low levels of HDL cholesterol.

These and other human data reported here by the authors are consistent with current hypotheses, generated from mouse studies, that abnormal fat and cholesterol levels in individuals with obesity-related resistance to insulin are in fact caused by partial postreceptor liver insulin resistance, i.e., defects in only some signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor on liver cells.",0

The sticky fingers are generated by Myosin-10 and cancer cells lacking Myosin-10 have a weaker basement membrane, making it easier for them to escape and spread.

24,"May 24, 2022 – The U.S. has begun releasing a monkeypox vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile to protect high-risk people. The two-dose vaccine is approved to prevent smallpox and monkeypox. “I can report that there has been a request for release of the Jynneos vaccine from the National Stockpile for some of the high-risk contacts of some of the early patients, so that is actively happening right now,” Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology at the CDC’s Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Center, said during a news briefing. Approved in the U.S. in 2019, the Jynneos vaccine is meant for use in high-risk adults, according to Reuters. McQuiston said the U.S. has a “good stock” of doses because it has prepared for the possibility of needing the vaccine for smallpox. “Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of that available,” McQuiston said. “We expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us.” ACAM2000 is another smallpox vaccine licensed in the U.S. It could be used to prevent monkeypox as well, and the U.S. has more than 100 million doses. “ACAM2000 is an older-generation smallpox vaccine that has some potential significant side effects with it,” McQuiston said. “So, a decision to use that widely would have to have some serious discussion behind it.” First, federal health officials plan to use a few vaccines among close contacts of the current patients to prevent the virus from spreading, according to CNN. “We are hoping to maximize vaccine distribution to those that we know would benefit from it,” McQuiston said. “Those are people who’ve had contact with known monkeypox patients, health care workers – very close personal contact -- and those in particular who might be at high risk for severe disease.” By the CDC’s count, the first confirmed monkeypox case in the U.S. is a man from Massachusetts who recently traveled to Canada. At least six suspected cases span across the country, according to ABC News, with one in New York, two in Florida, two in Utah and one in Washington. They tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there was also one suspected case of monkeypox under investigation in Sacramento County, CA, local news station KTXL reported. The suspected case was identified in a person who had recently traveled to Europe. Given the current outbreak, health care providers should assume that orthopox cases are monkeypox, McQuiston said. The CDC expects to receive samples from the suspected cases and test them this week. “It is likely that there are going to be additional cases reported in the United States,” she said. On Monday, Seattle health officials announced that a “presumptive” case is being investigated in an adult male who traveled internationally during the past month to a country that had reported monkeypox cases, according to The Associated Press. The initial testing was completed Monday at a state laboratory, the AP reported. Federal health officials will confirm the case. The man wasn’t hospitalized and is isolating at home, Seattle health officials said, noting that they don’t believe there is a high risk to the public. Also on Monday, the CDC issued a travel alert to “practice enhanced precautions” as monkeypox spreads in multiple countries. Cases have now been confirmed in more than 16 countries. “Risk to the general public is low, but you should seek medical care immediately if you develop new, unexplained skin rash (lesions on any part of the body), with or without fever and chills,” the CDC wrote. The World Health Organization announced Tuesday that there have been 131 confirmed cases and 106 additional suspected cases outside of Africa since the first case was reported on May 7, according to Reuters. Although the multi-country outbreak is unusual, it remains “containable” and limited, WHO officials said.

25,"Tumors contain various types of cells, including cancerous and benign cells. While the simplicity of cells in brain tumors may make treatment easier, the cells are not static and can change. Oncostreams, which are elongated, spindle-like cells found in tumors, determine the behavior of cancerous cells and how tumors grow and invade normal tissue. Brain tumors have a low survival rate, with recurrence being a major cause of death. Collagen 1, a protein produced by tumor cells, is necessary for oncostreams to form and function. Removing Collagen 1 production from tumor cells reduces tumor aggressiveness by removing oncostreams. This discovery could be applied to other types of cancer. The research team used artificial intelligence methods to identify oncostreams in tissue samples. The preservation of oncostreams by maintaining Collagen 1 production could be a potential therapeutic target for brain glioma treatment.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) do not improve visualization or accuracy of diagnosis in MRI. Recent studies have reported adverse reactions, including allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. Dr. Hye-Ryun Kang and colleagues analyzed over 330,000 cases of GBCA exposure in 154,539 patients over an eight-year period at the Seoul National University Hospital. There were no cases of allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. For patients with a history of previous GBCE reactions, the average recurrence rate was 15%. Acute allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions accounted for 1,178 cases, while 126 were delayed allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions, mainly occurring within one week of exposure. Patients with a history of similar reactions to iodinated contrast media were not found to have a higher risk of allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs. Premedication and changing the GBCA showed preventive effects in patients with a history of acute allergic-like hypersensitivity reactions. Only premedication significantly reduced the incidence of reactions in patients with a history of delayed reactions. Dr. Kang advises that appropriate premedication strategies be discussed with patients before MRI procedures. The researchers hope to conduct future studies with larger populations to identify possible risk factors and effective preventive strategies for delayed hypersensitivity reactions to GBCA.",1

Presidential Executive Order 11,110 is quite infamous among conspiracy buffs. Jim Marrs, author of Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, writes that the order instructs the Treasury secretary to issue about $4.2 billion in silver certificates as a form of currency in place of Federal Reserve Notes. Written by John F. Kennedy, Marrs also speculates this order was part of a larger plan by Kennedy to reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve by giving the Treasury more power to issue currency. The order was signed June 4, 1963. A few months later, of course, Kennedy was killed, and conspiracy theorists hypothesize a link between the murder and E.O. 11,110. They argue that the Federal Reserve was somehow involved in the assassination to protect its power over monetary policy.
The executive order modifies a pre-existing order issued by Harry Truman in 1951. E.O. 10,289 states ""The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby designated and empowered to perform the following-described functions of the President without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President..."" The order then lists tasks (a) through (h) which the Treasurer can now do without bothering the President. None of the powers assigned to the Treasury in E.O. 10,289 relate to money or to monetary policy. Kennedy's E.O. 11,110 then instructs that.
In summary, E.O. 11,110 did not create new authority to issue additional silver certificates. In fact, its intention was to ease the process for their removal so that small denomination Federal Reserve Notes could replace them in accordance with a law Kennedy himself signed.

30,"The VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) is the largest and most recent to test whether vitamin D or fish oil can effectively prevent cancer or cardiovascular disease. Results to date have been mixed but show promise for some outcomes, now confirmed by updated pooled (meta) analyses. The latest results from VITAL will be presented during The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Annual Meeting in Chicago, September 25-28, 2019.

Nearly 26,000 U.S. men and women participated in the nationwide VITAL clinical trial. After more than five years of study and treatment, the results show promising signals for certain outcomes. For example, while Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) showed only a small, but nonsignificant, reduction in the primary cardiovascular endpoint of major CVD events, they were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks. The greatest treatment benefit was seen in people with dietary fish intake below the cohort median of 1.5 servings per week but not in those whose intake was above that level. In addition, African-Americans appeared to experience the greatest risk reductions. The heart health benefits are now confirmed by recent meta-analyses of omega-3 randomized trials.

Similarly, vitamin D supplementation did not reduce major CVD events or total cancer incidence but was associated with a statistically significant reduction in total cancer mortality among those in the trial at least two years. The effect of vitamin D in reducing cancer death is also confirmed by updated meta-analyses of vitamin D trials to date.

""The pattern of findings suggests a complex balance of benefits and risks for each intervention and points to the need for additional research to determine which individuals may be most likely to derive a net benefit from these supplements,"" says Dr. JoAnn Manson, lead author of the study from Brigham and Women's Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.

32,"The frequency and size of meals was a stronger determinant of weight loss or gain than the time between first and last meal, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.

According to the senior study author Wendy L. Bennett, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, although 'time-restricted eating patterns' -- known as intermittent fasting -- are popular, rigorously designed studies have not yet determined whether limiting the total eating window during the day helps to control weight.

This study evaluated the association between time from the first meal to last meal with weight change. Nearly 550 adults (18 years old or older) from three health systems in Maryland and Pennsylvania with electronic health records were enrolled in the study. Participants had at least one weight and height measurement registered in the two years prior to the study's enrollment period (Feb.-July 2019).

Overall, most participants (80%) reported they were white adults; 12% self-reported as Black adults; and about 3% self-identified as Asian adults. Most participants reported having a college education or higher; the average age was 51 years; and the average body mass index was 30.8, which is considered obese. The average follow-up time for weight recorded in the electronic health record was 6.3 years.

Participants with a higher body mass index at enrollment were more likely to be Black adults, older, have Type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, have a lower education level, exercise less, eat fewer fruits and vegetables, have a longer duration from last mealtime to sleep and a shorter duration from first to last meal, compared to the adults who had a lower body mass index.

The research team created a mobile application, Daily24, for participants to catalog sleeping, eating and wake up time for each 24-hour window in real time. Emails, text messages and in-app notifications encouraged participants to use the app as much as possible during the first month and again during ""power weeks"" -- one week per month for the six-month intervention portion of the study.

Based on the timing of sleeping and eating each day recorded in the mobile app, researchers were able to measure:
• the time from the first meal to the last meal each day;
• the time lapse from waking to first meal; and
• the interval from the last meal to sleep.

They calculated an average for all data from completed days for each participant.
• Meal timing was not associated with weight change during the six-year follow-up period. This includes the interval from first to last meal, from waking up to eating a first meal, from eating the last meal to going to sleep and total sleep duration.
• Total daily number of large meals (estimated at more than 1,000 calories) and medium meals (estimated at 500-1,000 calories) were each associated with increased weight over the six-year follow up, while fewer small meals (estimated at less than 500 calories) was associated with decreasing weight.
• The average time from first to last meal was 11.5 hours; average time from wake up to first meal measured 1.6 hours; average time from last meal to sleep was 4 hours; and average sleep duration was calculated at 7.5 hours.
• The study did not detect an association meal timing and weight change in a population with a wide range of body weight.

As reported by Bennett, even though prior studies have suggested intermittent fasting may improve the body's rhythms and regulate metabolism, this study in a large group with a wide range of body weights did not detect this link. Large-scale, rigorous clinical trials of intermittent fasting on long-term weight change are extremely difficult to conduct; however, even short-term intervention studies may be valuable to help guide future recommendations.

Although the study found that meal frequency and total calorie intake were stronger risk factors for weight change than meal timing, the findings could not prove direct cause and effect, according to lead study author Di Zhao, Ph.D., an associate scientist in the division of cardiovascular and clinical epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Researchers note there are limitations to the study since they did not evaluate the complex interactions of timing and frequency of eating. Additionally, since the study is observational in nature, the authors were unable to conclude cause and effect. Future studies should work toward including a more diverse population, since the majority of the study's participants were well-educated white women in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., the authors noted author.

Researchers also were not able to determine the intentionality of weight loss among study participants prior to their enrollment and could not rule out the additional variable of any preexisting health conditions.

According to the American Heart Association's 2022 statistics, 40% of adults in the U.S. are obese; and the Association's current diet and lifestyle recommendations to reduce cardiovascular disease risk include limiting overall calorie intake, eating healthy foods and increasing physical activity.

The 2017 American Heart Association scientific statement: Meal Timing and Frequency: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention did not offer clear preference for frequent small meals or intermittent fasting. It noted that irregular patterns of total caloric intake appear to be less favorable for the maintenance of body weight and optimal cardiovascular health. And, altering meal frequency may not be useful for decreasing body weight or improving traditional cardiometabolic risk factors.",0
33,"Nov. 14, 2022 -- More than 3 million middle and high school students said they used tobacco products in the last 30 days, the CDC reports. That’s 11.3% of students surveyed. Overall, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle schoolers reported current tobacco use, the CDC said in its Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report. The most commonly used products were e-cigarettes, followed by cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, hookahs, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and pipe tobacco. The findings come from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which was conducted January 18, 2022, to May 31, 2022. “Commercial tobacco product use continues to threaten the health of our nation’s youth, and disparities in youth tobacco product use persist,” Deirdre Lawrence Kittner, director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health, said in a statement. “By addressing the factors that lead to youth tobacco product use and helping youth to quit, we can give our nation’s young people the best opportunity to live their healthiest lives.”

Broken down by groups, tobacco products had been used in the last 30 days by 12.3% of female students; 10.3% of males; 13.5% of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives; 12.4% of Whites; 11.5% of Blacks; 11.1% of Hispanics or Latinos; and 3.1% of Asian students. Tobacco use was reported by 16% who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual; 16.6% who identified as transgender; 18.3% who reported severe psychological distress; 12.5% with low family affluence; and 27.2% who reported getting mostly F grades. Favors, marketing, and misperceptions of harm are major factors contributing to youths’ use of tobacco. Most youth who use tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, want to quit, the CDC’s statement said. “Youth use of tobacco products – in any form – is unsafe,” said the report. “Such products contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and can harm the developing adolescent brain. Using nicotine during adolescence might also increase risk for future addiction to other drugs.” The report said the ability to compare the 2022 survey findings to previous years is “limited” because of differences in data collection procedures.",0

37,"Writing in Nature Medicine, an international team headed by researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine describe a new way to effectively deliver a gene-silencing vector to adult amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice, resulting in long-term suppression of the degenerative motor neuron disorder if treatment vector is delivered prior to disease onset, and blockage of disease progression in adult animals if treatment is initiated when symptoms have already appeared.

The findings are published in the December 23, 2019 online issue of the journal Nature Medicine. Martin Marsala, MD, professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, is senior author of the study.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons responsible for communicating movement are specifically harmed, with subsequent, progressive loss of muscle control affecting the ability to speak, eat, move and breathe. More than 5,000 Americans are diagnosed with ALS each year, with an estimated 30,000 persons currently living with the disease. While there are symptomatic treatments for ALS, there is currently no cure. The majority of patients succumb to the disease two to five years after diagnosis.

There are two types of ALS, sporadic and familial. Sporadic is the most common form, accounting for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. It may affect anyone. Familial ALS accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all cases in the United States, and is inherited. Previous studies show that at least 200 mutations of a gene called SOD1 are linked to ALS.

The SOD1 gene normally serves to provide instructions for making an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which is widely used to break down superoxide radicals -- toxic oxygen molecules produced as a byproduct of normal cell processes. Previous research has suggested that SOD1 gene mutations may result in ineffective removal of superoxide radicals or create other toxicities that cause motor neuron cell death, resulting in ALS.

The new approach involves injecting shRNA -- an artificial RNA molecule capable of silencing or turning off a targeted gene -- that is delivered to cells via a harmless adeno-associated virus. In the new research, single injections of the shRNA-carrying virus were placed at two sites in the spinal cord of adult mice expressing an ALS-causing mutation of the SOD1 gene, either just before disease onset or when the animals had begun showing symptoms.

Earlier efforts elsewhere had involved introducing the silencing vector intravenously or into cerebrospinal fluid in early symptomatic mice, but disease progression, while delayed, continued and the mice soon died. In the new study, the single subpial injection (delivered below the pia matter, the delicate innermost membrane enveloping the brain and spinal cord) markedly mitigated neurodegeneration in pre-symptomatic mice, which displayed normal neurological function with no detectable disease onset. The functional effect corresponded with near-complete protection of motor neurons and other cells, including the junctions between neurons and muscle fibers.

In adult mice already displaying ALS-like symptoms, the injection effectively blocked further disease progression and degeneration of motor neurons.

In both approaches, the affected mice lived without negative side effects for the length of the study.

""At present, this therapeutic approach provides the most potent therapy ever demonstrated in mouse models of mutated SOD1 gene-linked ALS,"" said senior author Martin Marsala, MD, professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

""In addition, effective spinal cord delivery of AAV9 vector in adult animals suggests that the use of this new delivery method will likely be effective in treatment of other hereditary forms of ALS or other spinal neurodegenerative disorders that require spinal parenchymal delivery of therapeutic gene(s) or mutated-gene silencing machinery, such as in C9orf72 gene mutation-linked ALS or in some forms of lysosomal storage disease.""

The research team also tested the injection approach in adult pigs, whose spinal cord dimensions are similar to humans, for safety and efficacy. Using an injection device developed for use in adult humans, they found the procedure could be performed reliably and without surgical complications.

Marsala said next steps involve additional safety studies with a large animal model to determine the optimal, safe dosage of treatment vector. ""While no detectable side effects related to treatment were seen in mice more than one year after treatment, the definition of safety in large animal species more similar to humans is a critical step in advancing this treatment approach toward clinical testing.""",0

Almost 30 years ago, while pregnant with my second daughter, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

It freaked me out at the time, but through healthy eating and smart interventions, I was able to avoid insulin.

I’ve barely thought of it since. I’m not even sure I always remember to mention it in health surveys.

A study being presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting, The Pregnancy Meeting, suggests I should have been paying more attention, and so too should all women, either before any pregnancy or after one that involved gestational diabetes.

In their study, the researchers say gestational diabetes is associated with an increased risk of more diverse cardiovascular outcomes later in life than previously thought.

Using participants in the UK Biobank, a database containing health information from an estimated half a million participants, researchers looked at the cardiovascular health of nearly 220,000 women who had delivered at least one baby between 2006 and 2010.

Results showed that slightly more than 13,000 women — or 6 percent — developed cardiovascular problems. It also showed that women with a history of gestational diabetes were at greater risk of a variety of cardiovascular problems, and that risk increased with age.

“Until now, the long-term outcome of GDM (gestational diabetes) in the elderly population has not been studied,” Dr. Seung Mi Lee, a specialist in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at the Seoul National University College of Medicine and lead author of the study, told Healthline.

“GDM increased the risk of diverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation in [older] women,” she added.

For practitioners in the field, this data backs up something they’ve been pushing all along: that a GDM diagnosis should be followed through life.

“This does not surprise me or any of my colleagues in any way,” Dr. Tamika Cross, FACOG, the author of “What a Doctor Looks Like,” told Healthline.

“It’s good to have specific data,” she added. “When counseling, we always talk about long term. But it’s vague and general. Now we can be more specific.”

Cross said that many forget the diagnosis as time goes on.

“I think calling it a ‘diabetes of pregnancy’ makes (patients) focus that way,” she said. “There’s a feeling of ‘after I deliver, it goes away.’”

OB-GYNs have long been fighting that.

“As OB-GYNs, we have long known that women with gestational diabetes have a significant risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life,” Dr. David Lubetkin, FACOG, the medical director of Boca Midwifery in Boca Raton, Florida, told Healthline.

“This study puts a quantifiable number on the risk, and shows how important it is to help identify those at risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future, and even identifying those women who [had pre-existing diabetes] prior to pregnancy unbeknownst to them,” he added.",0
47,"March 1, 2023 -- More animals have been detected with the H5N1 avian flu, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports.

The department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which maintains a list of detections of avian flu in mammals, has recently added 10 new cases from four states and including five species.

To date, 208 million birds worldwide have been affected by a massive outbreak of avian flu, which is spilling over to mammals.

Human infections have been rare and have occurred in people who had close contact with poultry, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Of the handful of cases that have been reported, some were severe or fatal, with others thought to represent environmental contamination rather than true infections.

In Colorado, inspectors found the virus in three mountain lions, a bobcat, two red foxes, and a black bear.

Elsewhere, striped skunks were detected in Kansas and Oregon. And North Carolina reported a black bear.",0
48,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0

At the societal level, the argument that the rise in the use of psychiatric drugs has caused a corresponding rise in violence and homicide does not hold water for the simple fact that there has been no corresponding rise in violence and homicide. Just the opposite. Over a twenty-year period, violent crime in general and homicides by youths in particular decreased significantly. Medications cannot be blamed for a crisis of 'mania, murder and mayhem' because there is no such crisis.
The argument at the level of individual shooters is damaged by the frequent errors made by people espousing their views, including inaccurate claims about which shooters took medications, whether they were on medications at the time of their attacks, and the effects the medications actually had on them.
The concern about adverse effects of psychiatric medications is a legitimate concern and worthy of ongoing research. This concern, however, is not well served by assumptions, misinformation, and innuendo in the place of facts.

52,"Aug. 10, 2022 -- Using substitutes for salt can reduce blood pressure and the risk of heart disease, stroke and death from all causes, a new study says.

A diet too high in salt composed of sodium chloride raises blood pressure and damages cardiovascular health, raising the chances of early death.

But the research published in the journal Heart says that we can lower all of these health risks by using a substitute for salt that replaces part of the sodium chloride with potassium chloride.

The survey results were reported in the British Guardian.

Some 32,000 people were involved in 21 clinical trials examining the effects of salt substitutes on blood pressure. Researchers discovered that the salt substitutes lowered blood pressure across the board, regardless of factors such as age, gender and weight.

“Salt substitutes produce consistent blood pressure-lowering effects across geographies and diverse participant subsets,” the researchers write.

There were no ill effects from using more potassium chloride, although it is a concern for people with kidney disease; they should limit how much potassium they ingest every day.",0
53,"Today, the University of Colorado Cancer Center released new research that showcases chemotherapy treatment before and after surgery for pancreatic cancer as the most effective combination for patients.

The study findings were published in JAMA Oncology and led by Marco Del Chiaro, MD, division chief of surgical oncology in the University of Colorado Department of Surgery and visiting researcher Toshitaka Sugawara, MD, PhD.

""It's critical to have large scale data that doctors can use to make decisions about chemotherapy plans for patients who qualify for pancreatic cancer surgery,"" said author Marco Del Chiaro, MD, division chief of surgical oncology at the CU Cancer Center on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

The study showed overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, compared to the group of patients that did not receive it.

This was the case for all patients independent of their lymph node status and resection margins.

""The success of adjuvant chemotherapy used to be unclear, with varied data available for doctors to consider. Our study suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery should be implemented no matter the biological stage of the cancer,"" adds Del Chiaro.

The researchers conducted a nationwide, retrospective study examining the overall survival of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not. To do so, they used data from the National Cancer Database and included nearly 900 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed between 2010 to 2018.

They found adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better survival in patients with any pathological N stage and margin status.

""It's important to continue to move forward research in pancreatic cancer care to improve the survival rate. By conducting the largest study of its kind and analyzing data using multiple models, we're able to improve the knowledge in this paper for doctors and patients to inform their plans and help prolong survival in many cases,"" said lead researcher Sugawara.

Sugawara and his team investigated the interactions between pathological findings and adjuvant chemotherapy in separate multivariable Cox regression models. Their findings suggest that tumors with aggressive biology benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy even after surgery.

The new findings were made possible by the research team at the CU Cancer Center.",0
54,"May 5, 2023 – There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause disruptions in women’s menstrual cycles, according to results from a study of nearly 3 million women in Sweden.

The study was initiated following widespread anecdotal reports from women who said they experienced changes in their cycles following vaccination, such as fewer days between periods or heavier bleeding.

The researchers did observe an increased risk for postmenopausal bleeding after a third vaccine dose.

The authors noted that “menstrual cycles vary naturally and minor menstrual disturbances are generally not considered to be of clinical importance. Changes can, however, generate considerable distress in the affected women, especially during a mass vaccination campaign when concerns are raised about adverse reactions that might not yet be well characterized.”

The Swedish study is the largest examination to date that looked for a relationship between vaccination and menstrual changes, but researchers found no evidence pointing to the shots as the cause.

The findings were included in this week’s edition of the British Medical Association journal called The BMJ. Data were analyzed for women in Sweden ages 12 to 74 years old from December 2020 to February 2022. More than 2.5 million of the 2.9 million women in the study received at least one dose of a Pfizer, Moderna, or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. More than half of the women received three doses. Drawing on data from primary care or specialist visits and from hospital stays, the researchers evaluated the impact of the vaccines within 1 to 7 days of getting a shot and within 8 to 90 days. They looked for menstrual disturbance such as a change in cycle days, unusual bleeding, and postmenopausal bleeding.

The researchers said they did see “weak and inconsistent associations” between vaccination and health care contacts related to menstrual changes and postmenopausal bleeding, but there were no patterns that were strong enough to conclude that the shots caused the issues.",0

• Topical CBD products are often mislabeled, with some products containing levels of CBD that differ from what’s listed on the label.
• Other CBD products may contain THC, the main psychoactive ingredient found in cannabis, despite being labeled ‘THC-free.’
• According to experts, mislabeled ingestible and transdermal CBD products may pose health risks, especially for individuals taking certain medications.
• Knowing how to identify a trustworthy CBD manufacturer can help consumers inform their decisions when purchasing CBD products. CBD (cannabidiol) is often marketed as a cure-all, but most products are unregulated. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has only one CBD product, Epidiolex, for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome. According to a , many topical CBD products available online or at retail stores don’t contain the amount of cannabidiol that’s listed on the label. The research, recently published in Jama Network Open, shows that some CBD products may even contain THC — the main active ingredient found in cannabis that causes a “high” — despite claims of being THC-free. “Misleading labels can result in people using poorly regulated and expensive CBD products instead of FDA-approved products that are established as safe and effective for a given health condition,” Tory Spindle, PhD, co-author of the new study and assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a press release.

CBD and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) are the most commonly known compounds in cannabis. While THC can produce a high, CBD doesn’t. Under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, (the Farm Bill), CBD products that contain less than 0.3% of THC are not considered illegal under federal law. This has led to the proliferation of questionable CBD products that have not been thoroughly tested to ensure they contain what the label claims they do. Still, some THC-containing CBD products disclose on labels that they contain 0.3% or less THC. This may vary depending on whether the CBD product is full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, or CBD isolate. In the new study, researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore tested 105 topical CBD products — including lotions, creams, and patches — purchased online and at retail stores in 2020. Only 85% of the products listed the amount of CBD in milligrams on the label, researchers found. Of products that listed the CBD amount, only about 25% were accurately labeled. By contrast, over half contained more CBD than listed on the label, while almost 20% contained less CBD than listed on the label. Researchers also detected THC in 35% of 105 products, although all were within the legal limit of 0.3%. However, four THC-containing products were still labeled THC-free and 19 didn’t mention THC on the label at all. Earlier research has found similar inaccurate and misleading labeling of CBD products. In a , researchers from the University of Pennsylvania tested 84 CBD liquid extracts purchased online. Around 30% contained the amount of CBD listed on the label. However, more than 40% contained more CBD than listed on the label, and around 25% contained less CBD than listed on the label. In addition, researchers detected THC in more than 20% of the products.

Jamie Corroon, ND, MPH, the founder and medical director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Education in Del Mar, California, said mislabeled CBD products are certainly a problem, but the health risks may depend on the product and how it’s mislabeled. If you use a CBD product that contains more CBD than listed on the label, especially for ingestible products, higher amounts of CBD could enter your bloodstream. Still, it’s unlikely that topical CBD products like lotions or creams, including those containing 0.3% or less of THC, would produce a “high.” According to Corroon, mislabeled topical CBD products that could present a higher risk are transdermal products — similar to nicotine patches — that are designed to move the compounds into the bloodstream through the skin. Of course, the presence of THC in a transdermal or ingestible CBD product presents different risks. For example, a person who ingested a mislabeled CBD product “might be driving a vehicle when the effects [of the THC] hits, and that could cause problems for them,” Corroon said. “It’s also possible that they might fail a drug test.” Indeed, a 2019 study by Johns Hopkins researchers found that the use of CBD products containing less than 0.3% THC may result in a positive result on a urine drug screening test. Experts have expressed concern that the amount of CBD in a product could interact with prescription medications that a person is taking, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, cholesterol medications, and pain medications. Corroon said for accurately-labeled CBD products, the risk of a drug interaction is “pretty small” unless the person consumes an entire bottle of CBD extract or uses a high-potency CBD product. “Nonetheless, the risk exists,” he said. Drug interactions with CBD may occur during the metabolization process. CBD is metabolized in the body by a family of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Within the CYP450 family is an enzyme called CYP3A4, which also metabolizes about 60% of prescription medications. However, CBD can interfere with CYP3A4 and inhibit how a medication is broken down in your system. If your body metabolizes a medication too slowly, it could mean that you end up with more medication in your system than you need, which may lead to unwanted or harmful side effects.

The FDA doesn’t regulate CBD products the way that it does prescription drugs, although the agency will send to companies if they run afoul of the law. This lack of upfront regulation, though, can make it difficult for people to find quality CBD products. One way to choose a high quality CBD product is to ask a healthcare professional you trust for their recommendations. While there’s no standard laboratory testing of CBD products, Corroon said that some companies do go the extra mile to ensure their products meet certain quality standards. Those that do, don’t hide that information, he added. “There are manufacturers out there that are making it easy for you to look at a certificate of analysis, such as linking to it from a QR code on the label,” Corroon said. “This hopefully would be more accurate than the label, especially if the analysis was done by an independent third party.” Another sign that a CBD manufacturer cares about quality is they don’t make health claims about their products — these kinds of claims are not allowed by the FDA for CBD products. According to Corroon, companies that want to stay in the marketplace for the long haul tend to be very mindful of the FDA and other government regulations for CBD products. “If a company is out there making a lot of claims, to me that’s a red flag,” he said. “So any company that’s saying ‘we can treat this’ or ‘we can cure that,’ I would avoid them.”",0

60,"A taste adaptation intervention lowers salt intake and increases enjoyment of a sodium restricted diet in patients with hypertension, according to a small study presented at ACNAP-EuroHeartCare Congress 2022, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).1

""One of the major barriers to sticking to a low salt diet is that people do not like the taste, but few studies have addressed this issue,"" said study author Professor Misook Chung of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, US. ""Our pilot study in patients with high blood pressure shows that it is possible to change taste perception and learn to like food with less salt.""

Hypertension affects more than one billion people worldwide and is the leading global cause of premature death.2 A healthy lifestyle, including salt restriction, is recommended to delay the need for blood pressure lowering drugs or complement their effects. However, the benefits of reduced sodium intake on blood pressure tend to diminish with time, partly due to poor adherence.

The researchers developed the Sodium Watchers Programme -- Hypertension (SWaP-HTN) for gradual taste adaptation to low salt food. This study examined its short-term effects on sodium intake, blood pressure, preference for salty food, and enjoyment of a sodium restricted diet. A total of 29 adults with hypertension were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care in a 2:1 ratio. Participants in the usual care group received routine medical and nursing care for hypertension including advice to follow a sodium restricted diet and take prescribed medications.

The intervention group received 16 weeks of education and follow-up with a study nurse via video call on a tablet. Sessions were held weekly for six weeks, then every two weeks for 10 weeks. The programme was individualised to each patient's barriers and weekly goals and included salt added at the table, salt used during cooking, grocery shopping, and eating in restaurants. Participants received an electronic device that detects salt content to enable them to identify and avoid high salt food.

Professor Chung explained: ""One of the first steps was for patients to realise how much salt they were eating. Using the electronic device they could test the salt content of restaurant meals and ask the chef to reduce or eliminate salt on their next visit. They also used it at home to lower the salt content in their own cooking. Some people automatically added salt at the table before tasting the food so we asked participants to count the number of 'shakes' and set goals for reducing it. Most participants removed the salt shaker from the table within three weeks.""

At baseline and 16 weeks, all participants provided a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake and had their blood pressure measured. In addition, preference for salty food and enjoyment of a salt restricted diet were assessed on a 10-point scale.

The average age of participants was 63 years and 55% were men. Three patients withdrew from the study and the final analysis included 17 and 9 participants in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively. The researchers compared changes from baseline to study completion between groups. The intervention led to a significant reduction in sodium intake and increased enjoyment of a salt restricted diet. There was a trend of decreasing mean systolic blood pressure in the intervention group, from 143.4 to 133.9 mmHg, but it did not reach statistical significance. The intervention did not change preference for salty food.

Professor Chung said: ""In the intervention group, sodium intake dropped by 1,158 mg per day, which was a 30% reduction from baseline, while the control group increased daily intake by 500 mg. Enjoyment of a low salt diet increased in the intervention group, from 4.8 to 6.5 on a 10-point scale, although patients still preferred salty food. It is likely that the intervention did not translate to a statistically significant fall in blood pressure because of the small sample size.""

She concluded: ""Our study indicates that we can retrain our taste buds to enjoy low sodium food and gradually reduce the amount of salt we eat. The gradual taste adaptation programme has the potential to control blood pressure but needs to be tested in a larger trial with longer follow up.""

1The abstract 'A gradual taste adaption intervention reduced dietary sodium intake among adults with hypertension' will be presented during the session 'ePoster session 3'.

62,"University of Helsinki and Taiwanese researchers have found a new way to remove waste from the brain after haemorrhage.

Intracerebral haemorrhage, and bleeding into the brain tissue, is a devastating neurological condition affecting millions of people annually. It has a high mortality rate, while survivors are affected by long-term neurological deficits. No medication has been found to support brain recovery following hemorrhage.

In an international collaboration, researchers from the Brain Repair laboratory, University of Helsinki, together with their Taiwanese colleagues investigated whether a protein called cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) has potential as a treatment for brain hemorrhage.

Researchers suggest that cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor, a protein being currently tested for Parkinson's disease treatment, also has therapeutic effects and enhances immune cell's response after brain haemorrhage.

The authors found that the administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor accelerates hemorrhagic lesion resolution, reduces brain swelling, and improves functional outcomes in an animal model of brain hemorrhage.

""Surprisingly, we found that cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor acts on immune cells in the bleeding brain, by increasing anti-inflammatory mediators and suppressing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that are responsible for cell signalling. This is a significant step towards the treatment of injuries caused by brain haemorrhage, for which we currently have no cure,"" says Professor Mikko Airavaara, from University of Helsinki.

Dr. Vassileios Stratouliasfrom the Brain Repair laboratory comments, ""It's interesting to note that after a bleeding episode, the brain contains a lot of waste and debris. Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor encourages immune cells in the brain to consume and remove the waste and debris, which is essential for the brain's recovery!.""

The administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor also resulted in the alleviation of cell stress in the area that surrounds the hematoma.

Finally, the researchers demonstrated that systemic administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor promotes scavenging by the brain's immune cells after brain haemorrhage and has beneficial effects in an animal model of brain haemorrhage.",0

64,"NIH statement from Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers, Director, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Chronic kidney disease affects more women than men, but most people with this condition don’t know they have it. This World Kidney Day, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health, joins organizations around the world in urging women to take action to prevent kidney disease — for themselves and their loved ones.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent and manage kidney disease and its main causes — diabetes and high blood pressure. One in seven Americans has chronic kidney disease, or CKD, a condition that can lead to kidney failure and means your kidneys are damaged and can’t filter blood the way they should. CKD affects 16 percent of women and 13 percent of men. Approximately 700,000 people in the United States have kidney failure treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Given the impact of kidney disease on women, the NIDDK encourages all women to learn about risk factors and talk with health care professionals. Taking action now can help protect your kidneys. Here are ways to reduce your risk:
• Choose healthier foods, such as fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.
• Be physically active for 30 minutes or more on most days.
• Reduce screen time, and aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.

65,"Recent research conducted outside of the NIH Clinical Center found that neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a highly effective biomarker for diagnosing and predicting traumatic brain injury (TBI) when compared to other blood proteins. NfL is better than other proteins at identifying patients with mild, moderate, and severe TBI and is the only protein that showed a correlation with functional outcomes. However, NfL is not the only protein that can distinguish TBI patients from uninjured controls. Additionally, a single TBI does not cause long-term neuroaxonal degeneration, which cannot be detected by measuring serum NfL. This suggests NfL can provide an easier, faster, and more cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic option than advanced brain imaging. The lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., notes that there is currently no validated biomarker that can reliably detect subtle signs of brain injury months to years after a TBI.

66,"July 13, 2022 -- Americans could soon have a fourth option for COVID-19 vaccines after the FDA today granted emergency use authorization to a two-shot vaccine from Novavax.

The vaccine is authorized for adults only. Should the CDC follow suit and approve its use, Novavax would join Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson on the U.S. market. A CDC panel of advisors is expected to consider the new entry on July 19.

The Novavax vaccine is only for those who have not yet been vaccinated at all.

“Today’s authorization offers adults in the United States who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine another option that meets the FDA’s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, MD, said in a statement. “COVID-19 vaccines remain the best preventive measure against severe disease caused by COVID-19 and I encourage anyone who is eligible for, but has not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, to consider doing so.”",0
67,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0

74,"NIH study broadens understanding of High Impact Chronic Pain in the U.S.

Researchers have demonstrated that disability is as likely in the chronic pain population as it is in those with kidney failure, emphysema or stroke. This is the reality for 11 million U.S. adults with High Impact Chronic Pain (HICP), a new concept that describes those with pain lasting three months or longer and accompanied by at least one major activity restriction. These findings directly address recommendations suggested in the National Pain Strategy by more accurately characterizing the HICP population to further understanding of chronic pain. This study — conducted by scientists at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at the National Institutes of Health as well as the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle,— was published in the Journal of Pain.

“The multidimensional nature of chronic pain is not reflected in commonly used operational definitions based solely on pain duration, resulting in inordinately high prevalence estimates that limit our ability to effectively address chronic pain on a national level,” said Mark Pitcher, Ph.D., visiting fellow in the Division of Intramural Research at NCCIH and one of the authors of the study.

Among the study’s top findings was the revelation that pain-related disability identifies a substantial portion of the chronic pain population experiencing progressive deterioration in mental and physical health outcomes along with substantially higher health care usage. Together, the HICP population constitutes some 4.8 percent of the U.S. adult population. About 83 percent of people with HICP were unable to work for a living, and one-third had difficulty with self-care activities such as washing themselves and getting dressed.

“By differentiating those with HICP, a condition that is associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and cognitive difficulty, we hope to improve clinical research and practice,” said M. Catherine Bushnell, Ph.D., scientific director in the NCCIH Division of Intramural Research and another author of the study.

The concept of HICP was first proposed by the National Pain Strategy to better identify those with significant levels of life interference. While prior epidemiological surveys have assessed the impact of pain using questions that ask how much pain interferes with life activities, it is likely that individuals with severe pain may have had difficulty distinguishing the increased effort required to carry out important life activities. As such, this study used an alternative approach to untether the pain experience from its impact. Activity limitations and participation restrictions were assessed using general disability questions without reference to pain experience.

“It is crucial that we fully understand how people’s lives are affected by chronic pain. It will help improve care for individuals living with chronic pain and strategically guide our research programs that aim to reduce the burden of pain at the population level,” said Linda Porter, Ph.D., director of the Office of Pain Policy at NINDS. “The findings from this study are a strong step toward these goals.”

The study employed nationally representative data from the 2011 National Health Interview Survey to assess the prevalence, psychosocial characteristics, health status and health care usage of the chronic pain population. The study also determined the degree of contribution made by other chronic health conditions to activity limitations and participation restrictions. Statistical analyses were performed on merged datasets that represented a weighted population size of approximately 220.3 million non-institutionalized adults.

This study ultimately highlights the role of pain-related disability as a key indicator of pain impact. Its findings not only serve to refine clinical research and streamline treatment, they also provide much-needed information to policymakers. As such, the results are relevant to researchers, health care professionals and legislators interested in shaping policy around a global health issue.

75,"Very low-dose Avastin effective for preventing blindness in preterm infants

Babies born prematurely who require treatment to prevent blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) could be treated with a dose of Avastin (bevacizumab) that is a fraction of the dose commonly used for ROP currently. Results from the dose-finding study were published April 23 in JAMA Ophthalmology. The study was conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) and supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Preterm babies are at high risk of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and prone to leaking. If left untreated, vessel growth can lead to scarring and retinal detachment, the main cause of ROP-related vision loss. ROP is one of the leading causes of blindness in children.

Established ROP treatments include laser therapy and cryotherapy. Both interventions work by causing the abnormal blood vessels to stop growing before they can cause scarring and retinal detachment.

Avastin is one of several available drugs that inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth by suppressing the overproduction of a signal protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin in 2004 as a cancer therapy. Since then, ophthalmologists have used it off-label to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in ROP, as well as in other ocular disorders. Results from a clinical trial published in 2011 confirmed the benefit of using Avastin over laser therapy for treating the most severe cases of ROP, which occur in a region of the retina known as posterior zone 1.

“As a faster and easier treatment option, anti-VEGF eye injections were a welcomed alternative to laser therapy for treating severe ROP,” said the new study’s protocol chair, David Wallace, M.D., MPH, chair of ophthalmology at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Laser therapy requires sedating the baby for as long as 90 minutes; an Avastin injection takes much less time and is generally less stressful to the infant.

“But we know that anti-VEGF agents injected into the eye also get into the bloodstream, and doctors worry that inhibiting VEGF systemically could interfere with normal development of brain, lung, bone, and kidney tissues,” he said. Evidence suggests that injections of anti-VEGF in the eye reduce levels of VEGF in the bloodstream.

In this study, Wallace and colleagues in the NEI-funded PEDIG hoped to pinpoint the lowest possible therapeutic dose of Avastin by testing progressively lower doses in 10-14 infants per dose. “We didn’t want to start by testing an ineffective dose and risk a child going blind, so we started with 40% of the dose commonly used for ROP. When a dose was successful, we halved it and then tested that dose. Eventually we cut the dose in half seven times,” he said.

“In the current study, we found that 0.004 mg of Avastin – a dose that’s merely 0.6% of the dose used in the 2011 study of Avastin for ROP – may be the lower limit to be effective for most infants with ROP,” said Wallace. The findings set the stage for a randomized controlled trial comparing long-term effects of low-dose Avastin with laser therapy for treating ROP,” he said.

They plan to follow children over time to compare the long-term effects of each strategy on vision and organ development. Previous studies suggest that babies treated with Avastin versus laser may be less likely to become myopic and require glasses for nearsightedness as they grow older.

The study involved 59 preterm infants with type 1 ROP, the most severe form. Each infant had one eye treated by a single injection containing 0.016 mg, 0.008 mg, 0.004 mg, or 0.002 mg of Avastin. If the other eye required treatment, it received twice the concentration (one dose level higher). By comparison, currently used doses of Avastin for ROP range from 0.25 mg to 0.625 mg.

Treatment was considered a short-term success if ROP improved by day four after therapy, and if there was no recurrence or need for additional treatment within four weeks. Such success was achieved in all eyes treated with the 0.016 mg and 0.008 mg doses, and in 9 of 10 eyes receiving 0.004 mg, but only in 17 of 23 eyes receiving 0.002 mg, resulting in the conclusion that 0.004 mg may be the lowest effective dose.

The study was supported by NEI grants EY011751, EY023198, and EY018810. The clinicaltrials.gov record is NCT02390531.

76,"Higher levels of the stomach-derived hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, predict a greater preference for smaller immediate monetary rewards over larger delayed financial rewards, a new study finds. The study results will be presented at ENDO 2021, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting.

This research presents novel evidence in humans that ghrelin, the so-called ""hunger hormone,"" affects monetary decision making, said co-investigator Franziska Plessow, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston. She said recent research findings in rodents suggested that ghrelin may play a part in impulsive choices and behaviors.

""Our results indicate that ghrelin might play a broader role than previously acknowledged in human reward-related behavior and decision making, such as monetary choices,"" Plessow said. ""This will hopefully inspire future research into its role in food-independent human perception and behavior.""

Ghrelin signals the brain for the need to eat and may modulate brain pathways that control reward processing. Levels of ghrelin fluctuate throughout the day, depending on food intake and individual metabolism.

This study included 84 female participants ages 10 to 22 years: 50 with a low-weight eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa, and 34 healthy control participants. Plessow's research team tested blood levels of total ghrelin before and after a standardized meal that was the same for all participants, who had fasted beforehand. After the meal, participants took a test of hypothetical financial decisions, called the delay discounting task. They were asked to make a series of choices to indicate their preference for a smaller immediate monetary reward or a larger delayed amount of money, for instance, $20 today or $80 in 14 days.

Healthy girls and young women with higher ghrelin levels were more likely to choose the immediate but smaller monetary reward rather than waiting for a larger amount of money, the researchers reported. This preference indicates more impulsive choices, Plessow said.

The relationship between ghrelin level and monetary choices was absent in age-matched participants with a low-weight eating disorder. People with this eating disorder are known to have ghrelin resistance, and Plessow said their finding might be another indicator of a disconnect between ghrelin signaling and behavior in this population.

The study received funding from the National Institutes of Health and a Charles A. King Trust Research Fellowship Award to Plessow. Naila Shiraliyeva, M.D., a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, will present the study findings at the meeting.",0

 Lastly, remember that Benadryl (diphenhydramine) provides no benefit following snakebite. Benadryl is an antihistamine. Histamine is not a major component of snake venom, so antagonizing the effects of histamine accomplishes nothing. It does not ""buy time"" or ""reduce inflammation"" or anything of the sort. All it does is give people a false sense of security and distracts them from the most important thing: getting to the hospital so that someone can determine the need for antivenom, which is the definitive treatment for snake envenomation. The only time Benadryl may be helpful is in the rare case of an allergic reaction to either the venom or the antivenom. And in serious reactions, the drug of choice would be epinephrine, not Benadryl, which helps for hives and itching but not the cardiac or respiratory complications.

85,"Identifying the dynamic events occurring during urinary tract infections (UTI) has revealed a new potential strategy to combat this condition, considered the most common type of infection. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Washington University School of Medicine have discovered that the sequence of events taking place during UTI sustains a delicate balance between the responses directed at eliminating the bacteria and those minimizing tissue damage that may occur in the process.

The NRF2 pathway stood out as a key contributor to this balance, by regulating both the potential damage to tissues and the elimination of bacteria. Treating an animal model of UTI with the FDA-approved, anti-inflammatory drug dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a known NRF2 activator, reduced tissue damage and bacterial burden, opening the possibility that DMF could be used to manage this condition in the future. The study appears in the journal Cell Reports.

""Urinary tract infections are not only common, but typically recurrent and tend to give rise to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a serious medical concern,"" said corresponding author Dr. Indira Mysorekar, E. L. Wagner Endowed Professor of Medicine- infectious diseases at Baylor, previously at Washington University School of Medicine.

""More than 85% of UTI are caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), bacteria that can attach to the surface of the epithelial cells lining the inside of the bladder, called urothelial cells,"" said first author Dr. Chetanchandra S. Joshi, a postdoctoral associate in the Mysorekar lab. ""Attached UPEC can then enter the urothelial cells, where they reproduce. In the current study, we looked at how urothelial cells fight back UPEC invasion and proliferation while preserving their integrity, which is essential for proper bladder function.""

Working with urothelial cells grown in the lab, Mysorekar, Joshi and their colleagues discovered that a precise sequence of events followed UPEC invasion of urothelial cells. First, in the early hours after their infection, urothelial cells defended themselves by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly active compounds that kill bacteria. However, if sustained, ROS also can damage urothelial cells, which would be detrimental for the bladder.

""We found that accumulation of ROS activated an anti-ROS response in urothelial cells, called the NRF2 pathway, that minimized the damage excess ROS could cause to the urothelial cells,"" Joshi said.

The NRF2 protein is located in the cytoplasm of the cells bound to another protein called KEAP1. ""When ROS reaches a certain level, NRF2 separates from KEAP1 and goes into the nucleus of the cell, where it activates a series of genes. Some of these genes produce proteins that block ROS, and some that limit inflammation,"" Joshi said.

""Interestingly, one of the genes NRF2 activates is Rab27b, which promotes the elimination of UPEC from urothelial cells,"" Joshi said. ""Together, these coordinated events mediate the elimination of UPEC while preserving the integrity of the cells attacked by the bacteria.""

A potential new way to combat UPEC

Understanding the process that follows a UPEC infection revealed a potential new strategy to combat the condition. ""We learned that active NRF2 was involved in both neutralizing ROS, which helped protect urothelial cells, and eliminating UPEC,"" Joshi said. ""These findings suggested that a drug that activated NRF2, such as DMF, might help clear UPEC infections.""

DMF is FDA-approved to treat inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis by dampening the inflammatory response.

""Working with an animal model of UTI, we showed that treatment with DMF activated NRF2, dampened the immune response, limited the level of damage the bacteria caused to urothelial cells, and promoted activation of RAB27B, which removed bacteria from the bladder,"" Mysorekar said. ""Our findings support further exploration of this approach as a potential treatment for UTI.""

Women tend to have recurrent UTI, which can lead to chronic inflammation, extensive bladder mucosal damage and chronic infection. Continued antibiotic treatment also negatively affects the microbiome, the 'good bacteria' of the body, and promotes the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

""The most exciting part about this work was identifying a non-antibiotic-based therapy that contained the infection and reduced inflammation,"" said Mysorekar, who also is professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor. ""Although much work is needed before it reaches the clinic, treatment with DMF has the potential of helping millions of women affected by this condition.""

86,"THURSDAY, April 6, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- Sleep problems — from snoring to sleeping too much or too little — may be associated with elevated stroke risk, researchers say. Snorting during sleep, having poor quality of sleep and sleep apnea may also be linked with greater risk of stroke, according to study findings published online April 5 in the journal Neurology. “Not only do our results suggest that individual sleep problems may increase a person’s risk of stroke, but having more than five of these symptoms may lead to five times the risk of stroke compared to those who do not have any sleep problems,” said study author Dr. Christine McCarthy, of University of Galway in Ireland. “Our results suggest that sleep problems should be an area of focus for stroke prevention,” McCarthy said in a journal news release. For the study, the researchers looked at nearly 4,500 people, including more than 2,200 stroke survivors. They were matched with more than 2,200 people who did not have a stroke.

Participants were an average age of 62. They were asked about their sleep behaviors, including napping and breathing problems during sleep. A total of 162 of those who had a stroke got less than five hours of nightly sleep, compared to 43 of those who did not have a stroke. Those with less than five hours of sleep were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who got an average seven hours of sleep, the investigators found. Another 151 stroke survivors got more than nine hours of sleep a night, compared to 84 of those who did not have a stroke. The long sleepers were twice as likely to have a stroke as those who got seven hours of sleep. In addition, people who took naps longer than one hour were 88% more likely to have a stroke than those who did not, the study found. The researchers also reported that people who snore during sleep are 91% more likely to have a stroke than those who do not. Those who snort are nearly three times more likely to have a stroke than those who do not. Participants with sleep apnea are nearly three times more likely to have a stroke than those without breathing disruptions during sleep.",0

Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccination is rare. TTS is a rare but serious adverse event that causes blood clots in large blood vessels and low platelets (blood cells that help form clots). As of February 3, 2022, more than 18.2 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the United States. CDC and FDA identified 57 confirmed reports of people who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and later developed TTS.CDC has also identified nine deaths that have been caused by or were directly attributed to TTS following J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. Women ages 30-49 years, especially, should be aware of the increased risk of this rare adverse event. There are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen.
-- To date, three confirmed cases of TTS following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna) have been reported to VAERS after more than 522 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered in the United States. Based on available data, there is not an increased risk for TTS after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

92,"A team of researchers says it has linked sensitivity to an allergen in red meat to the buildup of plaque in the arteries of the heart. While high saturated fat levels in red meat have long been known to contribute to heart disease for people in general, the new finding suggests that a subgroup of the population may be at heightened risk for a different reason -- a food allergen. The study, which is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, appears in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (ATVB), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.

""This novel finding from a small group of subjects from Virginia raises the intriguing possibility that allergy to red meat may be an underrecognized factor in heart disease,"" said study leader Coleen McNamara, M.D., a professor of medicine in the Cardiovascular Research Center of the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville. ""These preliminary findings underscore the need for further clinical studies in larger populations from diverse geographic regions and additional laboratory work.""

The number of people with red meat allergies in the United States is unclear, but researchers estimate that it may be 1 percent of the population in some areas. The number of people who develop blood antibodies to the red meat allergen without having full-blown symptoms is much higher -- as much as 20 percent of the population in some areas, the researchers say.

Only in recent years did scientists identify the main allergen in red meat, called galactose-α-1,3-galactose, or alpha-Gal, a type of complex sugar. They also found that a tick -- the Lone Star tick -- sensitizes people to this allergen when it bites them. That is why red meat allergies tend to be more common where these ticks are more prevalent, such as the Southeastern United States, but also extending to other areas, including Long Island, New York.

Researchers have suspected for some time that allergens can trigger certain immunological changes that might be associated with plaque buildup and artery blockages, but no one had identified a specific substance that is responsible for this effect. In the current study, researchers showed for the first time that a specific blood marker for red meat allergy was associated with higher levels of arterial plaque, or fatty deposits on the inner lining of the arteries. The blood marker they identified is a type of antibody (immunoglobulin or IgE) that is specific to the alpha-Gal allergen.

To identify this blood marker, the researchers analyzed blood samples from 118 adults and detected antibodies to alpha-Gal, indicating sensitivity to red meat, in 26 percent of them. Using an imaging procedure, the researchers found that the quantity of plaque was 30 percent higher in the alpha-Gal sensitized patients than in the non-sensitized patients. These plaques, a hallmark of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), also tended to be more structurally unstable, which means that they have an increased likelihood of causing heart attack and stroke.

The evidence for a link between red meat allergens and coronary artery disease is still preliminary, the researchers noted, so they plan to conduct detailed animal and human studies to confirm their initial findings. Currently, the only treatment for red meat allergy once it is diagnosed is strict avoidance of red meat.

""While more studies are needed, the current work provides a potential new approach or target for preventing or treating heart disease in a subgroup of people who are sensitized to red meat,"" said Ahmed Hasan, M.D., Ph.D., a medical officer and program director in NHLBI's Atherothrombosis & Coronary Artery Disease Branch.

For now, consumers are encouraged to follow current recommendations for a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes adapting a healthy diet, such as eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other heart-healthy foods. Lean red meats can be part of a heart-healthy diet for those who are not allergic. Other heart-healthy lifestyle changes also include aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, getting more exercise, and quitting smoking.

In addition to funding from NHLBI, this study was also funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). NIH funding support includes the following grants: (KO8-AI085190, K23-HL093118, RO1-AI 20565, PO1-HL55798, RO1-HL136098-01, RO1-HL107490)",0
93,"A gene target for drug resistance, a triple-drug cocktail for triple negative breast cancer, and patients' risk for carpal tunnel syndrome are among study highlights scheduled to be presented by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center scientists during the 33rd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, held Dec. 8-12.

Working with cell cultures and mouse models, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center have tested a cocktail of three drugs that holds promise for treating so-called triple negative breast cancers.

Women with such cancers lack all three hormone receptors -- estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). Currently, treatments for triple negative breast cancers are limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, which provide some improvements but overall poor prognoses.

In the new study, Johns Hopkins scientists began with a drug called Entinostat, which blocks an enzyme that unfolds DNA, providing regulatory molecules access to genes within and also reactivates a gene called retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARβ). Then, they added a drug called All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), related to Vitamin A, which binds a protein made by the reactivated RARβ gene. Together, the ATRA drug and RARβ gene act as a brake on cancer cell growth. The scientists completed the drug cocktail with conventional chemotherapy using either low doses of doxorubicin or paclitaxel.

According to the scientists, each of the three drugs used alone may have some effect on killing tumors cells, but combining them tips the scale in favor of killing more cells.

Tests on laboratory-cultured cells showed that the triple combo therapy halted the growth of multiple triple negative breast cancer cell lines more effectively than any one of the treatments alone. The combined therapy also rejuvenated the expression of RARβ, and strongly inhibited tumor growth in three-quarters of mice engrafted with breast tumor cells.

The researchers are discussing potential clinical trials of the combo therapy, which they hope to start in the next year, says Nguyen K. Nguyen, a graduate student in the Cellular and Molecular Medicine Program at Johns Hopkins.",0
94,"A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial. KPWHRI is part of NIAID’s Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium. The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks. The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.

The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.

The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of March 15, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.

Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.

The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort. The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.

Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits between vaccinations and for additional visits across the span of a year after the second shot. Clinicians will monitor participants for common vaccination symptoms, such as soreness at the injection site or fever as well as any other medical issues. A protocol team will meet regularly to review safety data, and a safety monitoring committee will also periodically review trial data and advise NIAID. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples at specified time points, which investigators will test in the laboratory to detect and measure the immune response to the experimental vaccine.

“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus,” Dr. Jackson said. “We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007.”

99,"DNA from uterine cells of women with endometriosis has different chemical modifications, compared to the DNA of women who do not have the condition, according to researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health. The changes involve DNA methylation — the binding of compounds known as methyl groups to DNA — which can alter gene activity. Moreover, the methylated DNA regions varied according to the stage, or severity, of endometriosis and responded differently to hormones involved in the menstrual cycle. Uterine responses to hormones influence pregnancy and other functions of uterine tissue.

The study was conducted by Linda C. Giudice, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco. It appears in PLOS Genetics. The study was funded by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).

“The findings raise the possibility that differences in methylation patterns could one day be used to diagnose endometriosis and develop customized treatment plans for patients,” said Stuart B. Moss, Ph.D., of NICHD’s Fertility and Infertility Branch.

Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other places in the body, such as on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the bowels and bladder. It affects from 5 to 10% of women in the United States. Its main symptoms include pain, especially during menstrual periods, and infertility. Endometriosis is classified into four stages, ranging from minimal (stage I) to severe (stage IV). The only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is with a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy.

The researchers analyzed a type of cell known as an endometrial stromal fibroblast, which regulates cells in the lining of the uterus. They compared methylation across DNA regions and differences in gene functioning in cells from women who did not have endometriosis or any other gynecological disorders to those of women with stage I endometriosis and of women with stage IV endometriosis. They also observed methylation patterns and gene functioning after the cells were exposed to estradiol (a form of estrogen) alone, progesterone alone, and to a combination of the two hormones to mimic changes in the levels of these hormones that occur during the menstrual cycle.

DNA methylation patterns and gene functioning differed among all groups of cells before exposure to the hormones, with exposure to each individual hormone, and to the combination of the two. The differences in methylation and gene functioning between stage I and stage IV endometrial cells could mean that the two may be distinct subtypes of endometriosis, rather than different degrees of the condition, Dr. Giudice added.

“The data indicate that the proper interactions of hormones and DNA methylation are critical in normal uterine function,” said the study’s lead author, Sahar Houshdaran, Ph.D., University of California, San Francisco. “The changes in these interactions that we’ve seen could play a role in the infertility that often accompanies endometriosis.”

101,"Dec 15, 2022 – Some people with type 2 diabetes may be able to lose weight, lower their blood sugar, and stop taking diabetes drugs, if they follow anintermittent fasting diet for 3 months, new research suggests.

Intermittent fasting – such as the 5:2 diet, which consists of eating few calories for 2 days followed by eating normally for 5 days – has led to weight loss in previous studies.

But it hasn’t been clear whether intermittent fasting might lower HbA1c levels – a measure of a person's average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months.

And specifically, it was not known if intermittent fasting could let people revert to a non-diabetic state, known as diabetes remission – defined as having a blood sugar level below 6.5% for at least 3 months after stopping all diabetes medications.

This new study in 72 patients with type 2 diabetes in China showed that indeed, the 36 patients in the intermittent fasting group lost roughly 13 pounds and maintained this weight loss for 1 year, and close to half achieved diabetes remission. This compared with barely any weight loss for the 36 patients in the control group, of whom just 3% achieved remission.",0

GO MOMs will enroll about 2,150 people in their first trimester of pregnancy and use continuous glucose monitoring technology throughout pregnancy to map blood glucose levels. The study builds on previous NIH-funded studies that found associations between elevated blood glucose during pregnancy and the development of type 2 diabetes in the future. Those who disagree state that the data collected from this study will not be helpful in determining timing and approach for future clinical trials and that treatment will not affect the children's health years later.

103,"May 31, 2022 – Coffee lovers, rejoice. Your morning ritual may lead to a longer life, and a spoonful of sugar could sweeten the deal, based on a recent study. Among more than 170,000 people in the U.K., those who drank about two to four cups of coffee a day, with or without sugar, had a lower rate of death than those who didn't drink coffee, reported lead author Dan Liu, MD, of the School of Public Health at Southern Medical University in Guangdong, China. ""Previous observational studies have suggested an association between coffee intake and reduced risk for death, but they did not distinguish between coffee consumed with sugar or artificial sweeteners and coffee consumed without,"" wrote Liu and colleagues in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. To learn more, the investigators turned to the U.K. Biobank, which recruited about half a million people between 2006 and 2010 to take part in questionnaires, interviews, physical measurements, and medical tests.

Out of this group, 171,616 of them completed at least one dietary questionnaire and met the criteria for the coffee study. Results showed that 55.4% of them drank coffee without any sweetener, 14.3% drank coffee with sugar, 6.1% drank coffee with artificial sweetener, and 24.2% did not drink coffee at all. Coffee drinkers were further sorted into groups based on how many cups of coffee they drank per day. Coffee Drinkers Were Significantly Less Likely to Die Over the course of about 7 years, 3,177 of the people being studied died, including 1,725 who from cancer and 628 from heart disease. After accounting for other things that might impact their risk of death, like lifestyle choices, the investigators found that coffee drinkers were significantly less likely to die from any cause, heart disease, or cancer than those who didn't drink coffee at all. This benefit was seen across types of coffee, including ground, instant, and decaffeinated. The protective effects of coffee were greatest in people who drank about two to four cups a day, among whom death was about 30% less likely, regardless of whether they added sugar to their coffee.",0

106,"The nucleus accumbens, part of the basal ganglia in the brain, is composed of neurons controlled by glutamate and dopamine. Dopamine regulates memory and learning, motor functions, and emotional behavior for motivation and reward. Researchers from Japan have now discovered that dopamine increases neuronal excitability via the phosphorylation of a voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily member (KCNQ2), promoting reward behavior in mice. Thus, KCNQ2 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders.

One part of the basal ganglia, known as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), is composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). The MSNs, in which the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) express, are controlled by neurotransmitters -- glutamate and dopamine.

Dopamine is an organic chemical that regulates memory and learning, motor functions, and emotional behavior for motivation and reward. On increasing the excitability of D1R-MSNs, dopamine promotes glutamate-induced responses, leading to a reward behavior, i.e., feelings of accomplishment and pleasure associated with completion of certain tasks.

It is known that the molecular mechanism underlying this reward behavior involves a signaling cascade that increases the ""phosphorylation"" (the attachment of a phosphate group) of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates. Subsequently, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), such as a downstream effector of PKA, modulates the excitability of D1R MSNs and in turn, the reward behavior.

Recently, a team of researchers, including Assistant Professor Daisuke Tsuboi and Professor Kozo Kaibuchi of the Fujita Health University, and Dr. Nambu Atsushi and Dr. Hiromi Sano of the National Institute of Physiological Sciences in Japan, identified an ERK phospsho-substrate known as potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2 (KCNQ2). Although certain studies have highlighted the role of KCNQ2 channels in MSN excitability, the details of the mechanism are still unclear.

Now, Dr. Tsuboi and his team have investigated the mechanism through which ERK regulates KCNQ2 activity and affects dopamine signaling. ""Dysfunctional dopamine signaling is implicated in several neuropsychological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and schizophrenia. Therefore, understanding the underlying pathway is crucial for treating several psychiatric diseases,"" Dr. Tsuboi remarks while discussing the motivation behind the study, which was published in Volume 40, Issue 10 of Cell Reports on September 6, 2022.

The team conducted experiments and mice and observed that the activation of D1R receptors with an agonist inhibited KCNQ-dependent currents and led to increased D1R-MSN firing rates in NAc slices of mice brains. Interestingly, MSN firing was halted on inhibiting ERK, suggesting its involvement in the process. Further analyses confirmed that the direct phosphorylation of KCNQ2 by ERK occurs through the activation of the dopamine signaling pathway in the NAc of mice.

Next, the team noted that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of KCNQ2 decreased its channel activity. Moreover, the conditional deletion of the Kcnq2 gene in the D1R-MSNs of mice reduced the inhibitory effect of dopamine on the KCNQ current, enhancing neuronal excitability and reward behavior. These effects were rescued when the Kcnq2 gene was re-introduced, but not when its phospho-deficient mutant gene was introduced. This implies that dopamine signaling negatively regulates the currents via KNCQ phosphorylation.

Based on these findings, the team proposed the following mechanism: Dopamine acts on D1R-MSNs to activate the ERK pathway that induces the phosphorylation of KCNQ2. This decreases the channel activity of KCNQ, which increases cell excitability and promotes reward behavior in the presence of glutamate.

So, what are the long-term applications of these findings? Dr. Kaibuchi explains, ""Mood disorders such as depression show signs associated with dysfunction of the reward system circuits in the brain. Hence, drugs modulating the dopamine-KCNQ2 pathway can be potential therapeutic targets for drug addiction and mood disorders. This study has highlighted KCNQ2 as a potential target for such psychiatric diseases.""

Here's hoping that these findings improve our understanding of the dopamine signaling pathway and its association with diverse emotional states.",0

A team in Germany from the Department of Theoretical Biophysics at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt am Main and the Synthetic Biophysics of Protein Disorder Group at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz has literally filled a hole in the understanding of the structure and function of these nuclear pores. The scientists found out how intrinsically disordered proteins in the center of the pore can form a spaghetti-like mobile barrier that is permeable for important cellular factors but blocks viruses or other pathogens.

Human cells shield their genetic material inside the cell nucleus, protected by the nuclear membrane. As the control center of the cell, the nucleus must be able to exchange important messenger molecules, metabolites or proteins with the rest of the cell. About 2000 pores are therefore built into the nuclear membrane, each consisting of about 1000 proteins.

For decades, researchers have been fascinated by the three-dimensional structure and function of these nuclear pores, which act as guardians of the genome: substances that are required for controlling the cell are allowed to pass, while pathogens or other DNA-damaging substances are blocked from entry. The nuclear pores can therefore be thought of as molecular bouncers, each checking many thousands of visitors per second. Only those who have an entrance ticket are allowed to pass.

How do the nuclear pores manage this enormous task? About 300 proteins attached to the pore scaffold protrude deep into the central opening like tentacles. Until now, researchers did not know how these tentacles are arranged and how they repel intruders. This is because these proteins are intrinsically disordered and lack a defined three-dimensional structure. They are flexible and continuously moving -- like spaghetti in boiling water.

As these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are constantly changing their structure, it is difficult for scientists to decipher their three-dimensional architecture and their function. Most experimental techniques that researchers use to image proteins only work with a defined 3D structure. So far, the central region of the nuclear pore has been represented as a hole because it was not possible to determine the organization of the IDPs in the opening.

The team led by Gerhard Hummer, Director at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics, and Edward Lemke, Professor for Synthetic Biophysics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, and Adjunct Director at the Institute of Molecular Biology Mainz has now used a novel combination of synthetic biology, multidimensional fluorescence microscopy and computer-based simulations to study nuclear pore IDPs in living cells.

""We used modern precision tools to mark several points of the spaghetti-like proteins with fluorescent dyes that we excite by light and visualize in the microscope,"" Lemke explains. ""Based on the glow patterns and duration, we were able to deduce how the proteins must be arranged."" Hummer adds, ""We then used molecular dynamics simulations to calculate how the IDPs are spatially organized in the pore, how they interact with each other and how they move. For the first time, we could visualize the gate to the control center of human cells.""

The tentacles in the transport pore take on a completely different behavior compared to what we knew before, because they interact with each other and with the cargo. They move permanently like the aforementioned spaghetti in boiling water. So, in the center of the pore there is no hole, but a shield of wiggly, spaghetti-like molecules. Viruses or bacteria are too big to get through this sieve. However, other large cellular molecules needed in the nucleus can pass as they carry very specific signals. Such molecules have an entry ticket, whereas pathogens usually do not. ""By disentangling the pore filling, we enter a new phase in nuclear transport research,"" adds Martin Beck, collaborator and colleague at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics.

""Understanding how the pores transport or block cargo will help us identify errors. After all, some viruses manage to enter the cell nucleus despite the barrier,"" Hummer sums up. ""With our combination of methods, we can now study IDPs in more detail to find why they are indispensable for certain cellular functions, despite being error-prone. In fact, IDPs are found in almost all species, although they carry the risk of forming aggregates during the aging process which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's,"" Lemke says. By learning how IDPs function, researchers aim to develop new drugs or vaccines that prevent viral infections and help healthy aging.",0
114,"ROCHESTER Minn. — A team of researchers from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center has been awarded a five-year, $11.5-million Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant in liver and biliary tract cancer from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Specialized Program of Research Excellence grants are designed to promote interdisciplinary research and help basic research findings move quickly from the laboratory to patient care.

To earn these competitive grants, institutions must demonstrate a high degree of collaboration between top scientists and clinicians and show excellence in translational research projects.

Principal investigators include Mark McNiven, Ph.D. and Lewis Roberts, MB, CHB, PhD. Collaborators include researchers from The Rockefeller University and the University of Pittsburgh.

“This is the only NCI-funded SPORE focused on cancers of the liver, which are the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the most rapidly increasing cause of death from cancer in the U.S.,” says Dr. Roberts. “This SPORE identifies Mayo Clinic as a premier center for the study, treatment and care of liver cancers.”

Researchers will conduct four translational research projects in liver cancer. In addition, funds will be used to develop a world-class biorepository for liver cancer specimens, a statistical core to provide analyses on research projects and an administrative core to manage projects. “We hope to attract both young investigators and experienced investigators from other disease areas to join us in the field of liver cancer research,” says Dr. McNiven.

According to the National Cancer Institute there were there were nearly 72,000 people living with liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in the U.S. in 2015. The number of new cases of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer was estimated to be 8.8 per 100,000 men and women per year and the number of related deaths were estimated to be 6.4 per 100,000 men and women per year. Approximately one percent of men and women will be diagnosed with liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer at some point during their lifetime.

The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center has five other current NCI SPORE grants in breast cancer, lymphoma (shared with the University of Iowa), multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. Mayo Clinic also has a brain cancer SPORE operating under a no-cost extension.

118,"UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers have found that the existing body mass index criteria for obesity surgery often excludes a group of obese patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.

The study, appearing in the December issue of the journal Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, is among the first to evaluate the risk-factor relationship between body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular disease as it relates to bariatric surgery criteria, said Dr. Edward Livingston, chairman of GI/endocrine surgery at UT Southwestern and lead author of the study.

“Our results show that cardiovascular risk factors do not necessarily worsen with increasing obesity,” Dr. Livingston said. “They also support the concept that obesity, by itself, doesn’t trigger an adverse cardiovascular risk profile or increased risk of death.”

The researchers examined patient data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database for the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors as a function of obesity. The survey was a cross-sectional study conducted from 1988 to 1994. All 17,234 participants had a BMI greater than 20.

BMI is a weight-to-height ratio commonly used in doctors’ offices to gauge obesity. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25, whereas someone with a BMI of 40 or more is at least 100 pounds over their recommended weight and is considered morbidly obese.

Bariatric weight-loss surgery is currently recommended for patients with a BMI greater than 40, as well as for patients with a BMI greater than 35 who also suffer from a life-threatening illness, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes, sleep apnea or heart disease.

The study findings show that some morbidly obese patients have better cardiovascular disease risk profiles than those who are less obese. In particular, the researchers found that cardiovascular risk factors can be much worse in many individuals with a BMI as low as 30 than they are for some surgical candidates with higher BMIs.

This suggests that some patients who are obese but not morbidly obese could benefit from bariatric surgery, which can help reduce cardiovascular disease, said Dr. Livingston.

Dr. Nicola Abate, associate professor of internal medicine in the Center for Human Nutrition at UT Southwestern and the study’s co-author, said it’s possible that very obese patients simply have a greater capacity to store excessive calories in their adipocytes, or fat cells, thereby preventing excessive fat from spilling into the bloodstream, where it contributes to heart disease.

“Our findings suggest that there is a group of individuals who have an almost unlimited ability to store excess calories as fat. This prevents changes in plasma metabolites, such as triglycerides and cholesterol, which promote risk for heart disease,” Dr. Abate said. “In contrast, those who can’t store as much fat and who only accumulate fat in the upper body often have excessive plasma concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol, which will increase their risk for heart disease. Even though their BMI may be below the current recommended cutoff, these patients could potentially benefit from bariatric surgery.”

Dr. Manisha Chandalia, associate professor of internal medicine in the Center for Human Nutrition, co-authored the study.",0
119,"Elevated cholesterol levels return to normal or near normal levels over time in four out of 10 children with uncontrollable epilepsy treated with the high-fat ketogenic diet, according to results of a Johns Hopkins Children's Center study reported in the Journal of Child Neurology.

In the four-year study, the Hopkins Children's team followed 121 epileptic children with intractable seizures on the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet designed to control such seizures. While most children developed high cholesterol after starting the diet, cholesterol gradually improved in nearly half of them, returning to normal or near-normal levels, with or without modifications to their diet to reduce fat intake.

In fact, researchers point out, diet modifications-including reducing total fat content or certain types of fats called saturated fats and adding nutritional supplements-reduced high cholesterol just as much as doing nothing. High cholesterol is defined as total cholesterol greater than 200 mg per deciliter of blood, bad or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol greater than 130, triglycerides greater than 130, and good or HDL (high-density lipoprotein) lower than 35.

Researchers prescribed dietary modifications to increase ""good,"" polyunsaturated fats in the diets of 15 children with elevated cholesterol. Dietary modifications decreased cholesterol by 20 percent in 9 out of the 15 (60 percent) children whose diets were modified. Surprisingly, cholesterol also dropped by at least 20 percent in 41 percent of the 37 children whose diets remained unchanged. The findings, while encouraging overall, also mean that relying on diet changes alone may not do much for those children in whom cholesterol remains persistently elevated, and that new approaches for these patients are needed, researchers say.

The findings should come as comforting news to pediatric neurologists, general pediatricians and parents of children treated with the ketogenic diet, and reassure them that, in most patients, increases in cholesterol may be short-lived, researchers say. Previous long-term studies by the Hopkins group of children who were on the diet between six and 12 years echoed these findings. The ketogenic diet, believed to work by triggering biochemical changes that eliminate seizure-provoking short-circuits in the brain's signaling system, is used in many children with hard-to-control epilepsy and in those whose seizures do not respond to traditional anticonvulsant medications.

""We are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels,"" says senior investigator Eric Kossoff, M.D., a pediatric neurologist at Hopkins Children's. ""This means the benefits of the diet-a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them-continue to outweigh the risks.""

Noting that 40 percent of children maintained normal cholesterol even after starting the diet, researchers found that children fed a formula-based, liquid-only ketogenic diet were nearly three times less likely to develop high cholesterol. Researches attribute this finding to the nearly zero fat content in commonly used ketogenic diet formulas.

In the group with normal cholesterol, 78 percent of children (31 out of 40) were fed formula-based ketogenic diet. This finding, while requiring further study, points to another possible treatment for high cholesterol, Kossoff says, by switching children with persistently elevated cholesterol to formula-based ketogenic diets at least some of the time.

The formula-based ketogenic diet contains only one-third the amount of saturated fats-the worst kind in terms of cholesterol-of the solid food version of the ketogenic diet. Because doctors can tweak the ratio of fat vs. carbohydrates depending on each child's severity of seizures, the investigators examined whether higher-fat versions of the ketogenic diet raised cholesterol additionally, but found that higher-fat ratio did not make cholesterol worse than a lower-fat ratio.

Some of the other findings:
• One-fourth of 121 children had elevated total cholesterol before starting the diet, which increased to 60 percent (59 out of 99 children at follow-up) after the initiation of the diet.
• 18 percent (22 out of 119) had triglycerides over 130 before the diet, which increased to 51 percent (49 out of 96) after starting the diet.
• 19 percent (21 out 110) had bad cholesterol over 130 before the diet, which increased to 53 percent (48 out of 93) after starting the diet.

The research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health. Other Hopkins investigators in the study: Juniad Nizamuddin, B.S., Zahava Turner, R.D., James Rubenstien, M.D., Paula Pyzik, B.A.",0

124,"African-American women had lower vitamin D levels than white women, and vitamin D deficiency was associated with a greater likelihood for aggressive breast cancer, according to data presented at the Third AACR Conference on the Science of Cancer Health Disparities.

""We know that darker skin pigmentation acts somewhat as a block to producing vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, which is the primary source of vitamin D in most people,"" said Susan Steck, Ph.D., M.P.H., associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Carolina.

Steck and colleagues observed 107 women who were all diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous five years. Sixty of these women were African-American, while the remaining 47 were white.

All women donated a blood sample, and vitamin D status was determined using circulating 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels as a marker. The mean serum concentration of vitamin D was 29.8 ng/ml in white women and 19.3 ng/ml in African-American women.

Researchers defined vitamin D deficiency as a serum concentration less than 20 ng/ml, and found this to be the case in 60 percent of African-American women compared with 15 percent of white women. Serum levels were lowest among patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and aggressive disease was eight times more likely among patients with vitamin D deficiency.

Steck said the findings of this study provide a foundation for a possible prevention strategy, but further research would be required.",0

126,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects all the organ systems of the body. This chronic disease includes periods of illness, called flare ups, and periods of remission, when symptoms are few. There is so far no cure for this disease; treatments involve preventing flare ups and reducing their severity and duration. One of the most severe forms of SLE is neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythromatosus (NPSLE), which affects the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal cord.

A team of researchers, led by Professor Masaaki Murakami at the Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, have identified a stress-induced molecular mechanism that affects NPSLE, revealing a potential target for the treatment of the disease. Their findings were published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The research team focused on a specific type of NPSLE called Neuropsychiatric lupus with diffuse neuropsychological manifestations (dNPSLE). There are believed to be many causes for dNPSLE, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The researchers were most interested in the effects of stress, as chronic stress is known to be involved in the development of many autoimmune diseases.

In order to identify stress-induced molecular mechanisms that might affect dNPSLE, they conducted experiments on mice models that exhibit SLE-like symptoms. After subjecting a set of these mice to sleep deprivation stress, they were able to identify that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the brain was abnormally activated.

In the mPFC, the expression of at least 509 genes was significantly affected by sleep deprivation. The team specifically noted the upregulation of a microglial proinflammatory gene that is required for two interleukins, IL12 and IL23. Further, they showed that upregulation of these two interleukins caused activation of the microglial cells of the mPFC. Blocking IL12 and IL23 pathways in these sleep-deprived mice models inhibited the stress-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Most importantly, they showed that levels of IL12 and IL23 in the cerebrospinal fluid of human patients with dNPSLE were higher than that of healthy individuals, to such an extent that it can be used as a diagnostic marker. They also showed that the mPFC in dNPSLE patients is atrophied. Together, these indicate that the findings from the mice models may be applicable to humans.

""In revealing the effect of the stress-induced effects on the expression of IL12 and IL23 in dNPSLE, we have identified them as not only a diagnostic marker but also a novel therapeutic target for this disease,"" said Masaaki Murakami.",0
127,"June 13, 2022 — The FDA is gearing up for a busy week – after a busy weekend releasing information about the effectiveness and safety of both the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children under 5 years old and the Moderna vaccine in children 6 months to 17 years of age. This data comes just before two FDA advisory panels are scheduled to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to recommend whether or not to authorize one or both vaccines in these youngest of Americans. The FDA does not have to follow its panels' recommendations but often does so. Early briefing documents released Friday and Saturday by the FDA shows both two-dose vaccines safe and effective in these age groups. The Pfizer data shows their vaccine to be 75.6% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in children 6 months to 23 months old, as well as 82.4% effective for children 2- 4- years-old. The Moderna data shows the vaccine to be 51% effective in children 6 months to 2 years old and 37% effective in children 2 years to 5 years old.

FDA documents also show that the Moderna vaccine appears safe and effective in 6- to 17-year-old children and teens. The agency noted two doses of the Moderna vaccine trigger an immune response in this age similar to the effectiveness seen in adults. Asked to comment on the early data on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and their authorizations, Matthew Harris, MD, medical director for the New Hyde Park based Northwell Health COVID-19 vaccination program said “I would certainly recommend the vaccine once it becomes available.” Nothing is certain until the FDA decides, though. And if the vote is yes for one or more of these vaccines/age groups, the CDC needs to sign off as well, which could come later this week after the agency hears from two of its own advisory panels.. Harris emphasized the significance of vaccinating children against COVID-19, and the ongoing challenge to convince parents to get the shots for both their younger and older children. “We still have a long way to go for primary vaccines and boosters for children 5 years and above,” he says. If one or more of these COVID-19 vaccines receives FDA authorization, it is expected that parents can start getting their children and/or teenagers vaccinated the week of June 20. According to Harris, healthcare professionals are expecting a “surge” of COVID-19 cases in the fall season, saying that the “timing of the vaccine is important.”",0
128,"The vegetables in salads are chock-full of important vitamins and nutrients, but you won't get much benefit without the right type and amount of salad dressing, a Purdue University study shows.

In a human trial, researchers fed subjects salads topped off with saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat-based dressings and tested their blood for absorption of fat-soluble carotenoids -- compounds such as lutein, lycopene, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin. Those carotenoids are associated with reduced risk of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and macular degeneration.

The study, published early online in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, found that monounsaturated fat-rich dressings required the least amount of fat to get the most carotenoid absorption, while saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat dressings required higher amounts of fat to get the same benefit.

""If you want to utilize more from your fruits and vegetables, you have to pair them correctly with fat-based dressings,"" said Mario Ferruzzi, the study's lead author and a Purdue associate professor of food science. ""If you have a salad with a fat-free dressing, there is a reduction in calories, but you lose some of the benefits of the vegetables.""

In the test, 29 people were fed salads dressed with butter as a saturated fat, canola oil as a monounsaturated fat and corn oil as a polyunsaturated fat. Each salad was served with 3 grams, 8 grams or 20 grams of fat from dressing.

The soybean oil rich in polyunsaturated fat was the most dependent on dose. The more fat on the salad, the more carotenoids the subjects absorbed. The saturated fat butter was also dose-dependent, but to a lesser extent.

Monounsaturated fat-rich dressings, such as canola and olive oil-based dressings, promoted the equivalent carotenoid absorption at 3 grams of fat as it did 20 grams, suggesting that this lipid source may be a good choice for those craving lower fat options but still wanting to optimize absorption of health-promoting carotenoids from fresh vegetables.

""Even at the lower fat level, you can absorb a significant amount of carotenoids with monounsaturated fat-rich canola oil,"" Ferruzzi said. ""Overall, pairing with fat matters. You can absorb significant amounts of carotenoids with saturated or polyunsaturated fats at low levels, but you would see more carotenoid absorption as you increase the amounts of those fats on a salad.""

The findings build on a 2004 Iowa State University study that determined carotenoids were more bioavailable -- absorbed by the intestines -- when paired with full-fat dressing as opposed to low-fat or fat-free versions. Ferruzzi; Wayne Campbell, a Purdue professor of nutrition science; Shellen Goltz, a Purdue graduate student in food science; and their collaborators, Chureeporn Chitchumroonchokchai and Mark L. Failla at Ohio State University, are the first to study different types of fats in differing amounts in human subjects.

Ferruzzi and colleagues will next work on understanding how meal patterning affects nutrient absorption. He is trying to determine whether people absorb more nutrients if they eat vegetables at one time or if consumption is spread throughout the day.

“The prevailing perception in the international media and scientific literature is that MPXV is endemic in people in some African countries.

On April 24, the National Institutes of Health terminated a grant for a research project on bat-borne coronaviruses after it was criticized by President Trump and a number of Republican lawmakers. While the grant was held by EcoHealth Alliance, a global environmental health research organization based in New York, it attracted negative attention because part of it supported collaborative activities with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China.
WIV houses a lab equipped to study the most dangerous class of pathogens, and a number of pundits and politicians are now suggesting it accidentally released SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Though thinly supported, the idea is fueling efforts to focus blame for the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chinese government. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), in particular, has cited suspicions about WIV and the actions of Chinese leaders during the pandemic as justifying a hardline stance, which he said this week could include cutting off student visas in technical fields.

A new CDC analysis of current data from the v-safe pregnancy registry assessed vaccination early in pregnancy and did not find an increased risk of miscarriage among nearly 2,500 pregnant women who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Miscarriage typically occurs in about 11-16% of pregnancies, and this study found miscarriage rates after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine were around 13%, similar to the expected rate of miscarriage in the general population.
Previously, data from three safety monitoring systems did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated late in pregnancy or for their babies. Combined, these data and the known severe risks of COVID-19 during pregnancy demonstrate that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant people outweigh any known or potential risks.

138,"Oct. 4, 2022 -- Paige E, a 76-year-old retired psychotherapist, had always enjoyed yoga, which she found relaxing, invigorating, and spiritually meaningful. As she grew older and faced increasing physical challenges, she began taking yoga classes for seniors. When the COVID-19 lockdown began, Paige was concerned that she might need to give up yoga classes. She knew she could practice on her own but felt she needed the structure of a class and the support of an instructor. So she decided to take online classes with Howard Katz, a Teaneck, NJ-based yoga instructor, with whom she had taken in-person classes in the past. At first, she was skeptical whether the online format would be useful. “I’m not very tech-savvy — in fact, I’m a tech dinosaur — and I worried that I wouldn’t be able to manage the technology or relate to a virtual format,” she says. She was also concerned because she has some brain challenges and wasn’t sure how they would impact her ability to participate in online learning. “I don’t have classic dementia or Alzheimer’s, but I do have memory and organizational issues that are related to other health problems,” she says. Fortunately, she was able to master the technology and benefit from the classes. Online yoga became part of the “new normal” during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its use has remained since then. And although some people prefer in-person settings, many continue to prefer the convenience, affordability, and other benefits of online yoga. This is also true for classes targeting seniors, including those with cognitive impairments. A recent study found that a remotely offered home-based chair yoga intervention was helpful for older adults with dementia. “The telehealth-based chair yoga intervention was found to be convenient to both participants and their caregivers in keeping them physically active, as it was easily accessible from home and did not require transportation or getting dressed, which reduced caregiver burden and stress,"" says senior researcher JuYoung Park, PhD, a professor in the Phyllis and Harvey Sandler School of Social Work at Florida Atlantic University’s College of Social Work and Criminal Justice.

Seniors with dementia “can focus on the chair yoga intervention more effectively in a comfortable home environment rather than in a community center, with its associated distractions,” she explains. Notably, there were no injuries or other adverse events during the intervention, “indicating that online chair yoga with caregiver support is safe.” Park stresses that some people might face technological challenges in accessing online sessions, so tech support should be provided if necessary. And “since the instructor cannot engage in direct action with the participant, it’s recommended that a caregiver attend sessions with the person with dementia, monitor the participant for safety, and assist in following the poses correctly.” What Is Yoga for Seniors? Katz teaches older adults in senior centers and also offers online and in-person group and private classes to seniors through his own yoga studio. “Senior yoga is regular yoga made accessible for older adults who might experience age-related physical challenges,” says Katz. “With seniors, I usually start with gentle warm-ups, then guide them through basic standing forward bends, gentle back bends, and warrior poses,” says Katz. Props such as blocks, straps, and chairs are offered, and postures are modified to accommodate the physical challenges of seniors. “Some seniors can’t sit on the floor because they have difficulty getting up, so I modify the postures so that they can sit on a chair. Some have difficulty with balance, so they hold onto the chair or wall,” Katz notes. In fact, half the postures in his Yoga for Seniors classes are seated, while the other half are standing. Katz’s yoga classes emphasize breathing techniques. In particular, he likes to teach alternate nostril breathing (Nadi Shodhana), ocean-sounding breath (Ujjayi), and bee-breath (Brahmerie) which are calming for people with anxiety and stress and have other benefits as well -- like lowering blood pressure, for example. All of Katz’s classes include meditation, which, he says, can bring calm, peace, and spiritual opening to people of all ages and has also been shown to be helpful in improving cognition and quality of life in seniors.

“I regard yoga postures and breathing as preparation for the most important component of yoga, which is meditation,” he explains. Addressing the Special Needs of Seniors With Cognitive Challenges Katz offers private in-person and online classes to people with cognitive impairments. “Classes are highly individualized, and all the components are modified, depending on the student’s cognitive level and needs,” he says. For example, he simplifies the breathing techniques or postures and explains everything more slowly, repeating instructions and explanations as often as necessary. Some individuals with mild cognitive impairment can take classes alone. But those with more severe impairments or with dementia benefit from having a caregiver present for safety and to reinforce the yoga lesson, according to Katz. “It also creates a shared bond and activity for the caregiver and the student to do yoga together,"" he says. Paige’s cognitive impairments are mild. She lives independently, does not require a caregiver, and successfully takes online classes with Katz, who “is patient and supportive when I don’t remember some things,” she says. “He explains things well, so I understand what each posture is designed to accomplish, and he creates a safe atmosphere, so I never feel rushed or judged.” Paige feels that yoga has helped her physical health, cognition, and mood. “Yoga is a gift in my life, and I encourage other seniors to try it,” she says.",0
139,"Although for nearly 60 years people have been urged to decrease their consumption of saturated fats to prevent heart disease, until now there has been surprisingly little scientific evidence that doing so actually decreased the risk of coronary heart disease events. A new study by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) provides the first conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that people who replace saturated fat in their diet with polyunsaturated fat reduce their risk of coronary heart disease by 19%, compared with control groups of people who do not.

By systematically reviewing a large group of randomized clinical trials and conducting a pooled meta-analysis of these studies, the HSPH team's findings show that increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fats as a replacement for saturated fats could significantly reduce the rate of heart attacks and cardiac deaths in the population. The study appears in the March 23, 2010 issue of the open-access journal PLoS Medicine.

Over the past several decades, the food industry has reduced the amount of saturated fat in many products, and the public has reduced the amount of saturated fat in their diet. However, there has been a wide variation in the types of nutrients that have replaced this saturated fat. For example, in many products saturated fats were replaced with trans fats, which have since been determined to be detrimental; and in the overall American diet saturated fat was generally replaced with increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and grains.

""The specific replacement nutrient for saturated fat may be very important,"" said lead author Dariush Mozaffarian, assistant professor in the department of epidemiology at HSPH and the department of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Our findings suggest that polyunsaturated fats would be a preferred replacement for saturated fats for better heart health.""

Results from prior individual randomized controlled trials of saturated fat reduction and heart disease events were very mixed, with most showing no significant effects. Other trials focused only on blood cholesterol levels, which are an indirect marker of risk. Large observational studies have also generally shown no relationship between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease events; for example, earlier this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers from HSPH and Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute performed a pooled meta-analysis of prior observational studies and found no evidence that overall consumption of saturated fat was related to risk of coronary heart disease or stroke events.

Some of these mixed findings may relate to absence of prior focus on the specific replacement nutrient for saturated fat; in other words, was saturated fat replaced primarily with carbohydrate, monounsaturated fats such as in olive oil, or polyunsaturated fats such as in most vegetable oils?

Mozaffarian and his HSPH colleagues, Renata Micha and Sarah Wallace, performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials through June 2009 in which participants specifically increased their polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat and in which coronary heart disease events were documented. Eight trials met the inclusion criteria, totaling 13,614 participants with 1,042 coronary heart disease events.

The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%. For every 5% increase (measured as total energy) in polyunsaturated fat consumption, coronary heart disease risk was reduced by 10%. This is now just the second dietary intervention--consuming long-chain omega-3 fatty acids is the first -- to show a reduction in coronary heart disease events in randomized controlled trials.

Currently, the Institute of Medicine guidelines recommend that a range of 5%-10% energy consumption come from polyunsaturated fats. In addition, some scientists and organizations have recently suggested that consumption of polyunsaturated fats (largely ""omega-6"" fatty acids) should actually be reduced due to theoretical concerns that such consumption could increase coronary heart disease risk.

The results from this study suggest that polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils may be an optimal replacement for saturated fats, an important finding for dietary guidelines and for when food manufacturers and restaurants are making decisions on how to reduce saturated fat in their products. The findings also suggest that an upper limit of 10% energy consumption from polyunsaturated fats may be too low, as the participants in these trials who reduced their risk were consuming about 15% energy from polyunsaturated fats.

Support for this study was provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH and a Searle Scholar Award from the Searle Funds at the Chicago Community Trust.",0
140,"Oct. 15, 2022 -- With health officials saying a winter spike in COVID-19 cases is possible, the Biden administration this week extended the COVID-19 public health emergency to Jan. 11, 2023.

The COVID public health emergency was first declared in January 2020 by the Trump administration and has been renewed every 90 days since.

The declaration allowed changes throughout the healthcare system, including the free distribution of COVID vaccines and treatments. Medicaid coverage was expanded to millions of Americans, more telehealth services were authorized, and hospitals gained flexibility in how to respond to patient surges. 

COVID is easing statistically, with case counts, deaths, and hospitalizations dropping. About a month ago, President Biden went on “60 Minutes” and said, “the pandemic is over.”

Health officials note that COVID spiked during the winter months during the last two years and say that could happen again.

“We were going in the right direction in the summer of 2021, and along came Delta,” Anthony Fauci, MD, White House medical advisor, said during a virtual conversation for the University of Southern California’s Annenberg’s Center for Health Journalism. “Then in the winter, along came Omicron. And since then, we’ve had sublineages of Omicron.” 

The administration has urged Americans to get COVID boosters ahead of the Thanksgiving holidays when families gather together.

Republicans have urged Biden to end the public health emergency and Congress has not supported Biden’s efforts to secure more spending for COVID. The distribution of free at-home tests halted last month because of a lack of funding.

The administration says it will give 60-days’ notice before ending the public health emergency.

The United States has recorded almost 97 million confirmed COVID cases and more than 1 million COVID-related deaths – more than any other nation.",0
141,"Elevated cholesterol levels and liver enzyme levels appear to be more common than previously thought among patients taking the acne medication isoretinoin, including those who had normal blood test results before beginning therapy, according to a report in the August issue of Archives of Dermatology, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.

Isoretinoin, commonly marketed as Accutane, is the most effective acne treatment currently available, according to background information in the article. As many as 89 percent of patients taking the medication achieve long-term remission from acne. Side effects include elevations in the levels of triglycerides, blood fats that can have an adverse effect on cardiovascular health; liver enzymes, the presence of which indicates liver disease or inflammation; and total blood cholesterol. According to the article, the Accutane package insert notes that 25 percent of patients develop elevated triglycerides and 15 percent elevated liver enzymes. Other studies have found elevated triglycerides in 5 to 18 percent and elevated total cholesterol in 6 to 32 percent of individuals taking the drug.

Lee T. Zane, M.D., M.A.S., University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues assessed the frequency of abnormal laboratory tests in a population of 13,772 patients (aged 13 to 50 years, 51 percent male and 49 percent female) with acne who underwent isoretinoin therapy between 1995 and 2002. The researchers analyzed medical records for each patient before, during and after they took the medication, using information from laboratory tests of triglycerides; total cholesterol; liver transaminase (enzymes) levels; white blood cell (cells that fight infection) count; hemoglobin (which carries oxygen through the body) level; and platelet (involved in blood clotting) count.

Patients taking isoretinoins had an increased incidence of elevated triglyceride, total cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, but not hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts or platelet counts. Among patients with normal pretreatment laboratory tests, 44 percent developed high triglycerides, 31 percent high cholesterol and 11 percent high liver enzymes while taking the medication. ""Moderate to severe abnormalities in triglyceride, total cholesterol and transaminase levels were generally transient and reversible,"" the authors write. ""Among those subjects with such abnormalities who received posttreatment testing, the proportion returning to normal or grade 1 [slightly elevated] levels by the end of the posttreatment period was 92 percent for transaminase level, 80 percent for triglyceride level and 79 percent for total cholesterol level.""

""Our study did not examine adverse clinical outcomes and thus cannot estimate the ability of abnormal laboratory results to predict such outcomes,"" they conclude. ""In clinical practice, laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated in the clinical context of the individual patient. Neither does the presence of a laboratory abnormality necessarily signal the presence of an adverse clinical outcome, nor does the absence of a laboratory abnormality preclude the possibility of an adverse clinical outcome."" Still, patients with acne who develop substantially high triglyceride levels are at risk for high cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, which in turn may increase the risk for coronary artery disease; further study is needed regarding these side effects, the authors write.

Previous attempts at blocking angiogenesis have failed, as tumor cells responded by producing more stimulatory molecules. The new strategy avoids disabling key enzymes and instead targets the recycling of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) necessary for reactions that sustain new vessel growth. By disabling genes for one or more of the enzymes and targeting tumors in mice with drugs that block the recycling enzymes, mice had less tumor and tumor blood vessel growth.

147,"Photoreceptor cells in mice drive vision and non-vision functions using distinct circuits in the eye.

The eye’s light-sensing retina taps different circuits depending on whether it is generating image-forming vision or carrying out a non-vision function such as regulating pupil size or sleep/wake cycles, according to a new mouse study from the National Eye Institute (NEI) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The findings could have implications for understanding how our eyes help regulate mood, digestion, sleep, and metabolism. NEI and NIMH are part of the National Institutes of Health.

“We know a lot about pathways involved in image-forming vision, but until now it remained unknown if and how non-image-forming visual behaviors rely on these same pathways in the eye,” said Johan Pahlberg, Ph.D., head of the Photoreceptor Physiology Group at NEI and a senior author of the study.

Vision begins when light travels into the eye and hits the retina’s light-sensing photoreceptors. The photoreceptors transfer signals through several layers of retinal neuron before those signals are sent to the brain. Light also triggers certain non-vision functions, such as controlling how much light enters the eye through the pupil (pupillary light reflex) and regulating the wake/sleep cycle (circadian rhythm). Circadian rhythm disruption has been linked to sleep problems, obesity, and other health issues.

To investigate pathways used by image-forming versus non-image-forming functions in the retina, Pahlberg and colleagues studied groups of mice that had been genetically modified to turn off one or more pathway links, or synapses, between photoreceptors and their next downstream neuronal neighbors, called bipolar cells. The group investigated the roles of rod photoreceptors, which are sensitive to low light levels; cone photoreceptors, which see color; as well as three types of bipolar cells: rod bipolar cells, “on” cone bipolar cells, and “off” cone bipolar cells.

“On” cone bipolar cells react to increases in light, and “off” cone bipolar cells react to decreases in light. Cone photoreceptors can only communicate with cone bipolar cells, while rod photoreceptors have pathways to communicate with each of the bipolar cell types, depending on the level of light. Bipolar cells then communicate with other neurons in the retina, passing information to the optic nerve and on to the brain. Some mice in the study had no functional connections between rods and “on” bipolar cells, for example, or connections between cones and any bipolar cells, or lacked connections between rod and cone photoreceptors.

The researchers compared the mice’s responses to visual stimuli while assessing pupillary light responses and monitoring their nocturnal wake/sleep cycle. They determined that while image-forming vision can use rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as all the types of bipolar cells, the same was not true for non-image forming functions. The pupil response relies exclusively on rod photoreceptors, while cones are unable to control this behavior. Meanwhile, both circadian rhythm regulation and the pupil reflex only use “on” bipolar cells pathways, relying on rod bipolar cells and “on” cone bipolar cells, but not “off” cone bipolar cells.

“We were really surprised to find that animals with only ‘off’ bipolar cells can’t adjust to changes in the day/night cycle, but can still see and respond to visual events, meaning they have functional image-forming vision. It was really interesting to us that the non-imaging forming functions completely ignore information from the ‘off’ pathway,” said Pahlberg. “We were equally surprised that rod photoreceptors, which are optimized for low light conditions, were still being used for the pupillary response even when light levels were high. We really thought the rods would be maxed out at that point.”

Pahlberg expects many of these findings in mice will hold true for humans, since the retinal circuitry is similar across mammals. Moving forward, he intends to explore other non-image-forming functions of the retina, like mood regulation, and see how else these different retinal circuits are being used.

The research was funded by the intramural programs of NEI, NIMH, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke.

148,"Sweden is one of the few countries that have removed the dental health recommendation to give prophylactic antibiotics to people at a higher risk of infection of the heart valves, so-called infective endocarditis. Since the recommendation was removed in 2012, there has been no increase in this disease, a registry study from Karolinska Institutet published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases shows.

Infective endocarditis is a rare but life-threatening disease caused by bacterial infection of the heart valves that affects some 500 people a year in Sweden. Individuals with congenital heart disease, prosthetic heart valves or previous endocarditis are at higher risk of infection.

People at a higher risk of infective endocarditis in Sweden used to receive the antibiotic amoxicillin as a prophylactic ahead of certain dental procedures, such as tooth extraction, tartar scraping and surgery. This recommendation was lifted in 2012 due to a lack of evidence that the treatment was necessary and to help prevent antibiotic resistance by reducing antibiotic use. A collaborative project involving researchers from Karolinska Institutet has now studied how the decision has affected the incidence of infective endocarditis.

""We can only see small, statistically non-significant variations in morbidity, nothing that indicates a rise in this infection in the risk group since 2012,"" says the study's corresponding author Niko Vähäsarja, dentist and doctoral student at the Department of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet. ""Our study therefore supports the change in recommendation. This is an internationally debated issue and Sweden and the UK are the only countries in Europe to restrict antibiotic use like this.""

The registry study encompassed 76,762 high-risk individuals and 396,048 individuals at a low risk of infective endocarditis, who were monitored from 2008 to 2018 with the help of the Medical Birth Registry, the National Patient Register and the Swedish Endocarditis Registry.

The recommendation was supplemented in 2016 with an instruction to consider prophylactic antibiotic treatment if prescribed by the patient's doctor. It is unclear how this addition has influenced the prescription of antibiotics by dentists.

After the change in recommendation in 2012, prescriptions of amoxicillin in dentistry declined by approximately 40 per cent. However, the study is unable to demonstrate that this was an effect of the amended recommendation and amoxicillin has other uses in dental medicine.

""The next step is to examine which dental procedures the individuals in the risk group underwent during the 2008-2018 period, since this is information we lack and it could add to our knowledge of what is to date a poorly studied issue,"" says Mr Vähäsarja. ""This and the study we've just published could inform similar recommendation changes in other countries, resulting in a reduction in antibiotic use.""

149,"The test results can assist health care providers with treatment choices, improving patient care.

ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic has launched a first-in-the-U.S. clinical test that will help patients who recently have been diagnosed with an inflammatory demyelinating disease (IDD) but may be unsure of the exact disorder. Neurologic-related diseases commonly affect the brain, optic nerves and the spinal cord, and this new test can distinguish other IDDs such as neuromyelitis optica, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis from multiple sclerosis (MS).

The test uses live cells to identify patients who are positive for an antibody to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (or “MOG,” for short). But why is this sticky protein so important?

“From our years of research, we have learned that if patients test positive for MOG antibodies, it generally indicates that it’s not classical MS,” says Sean Pittock, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and director of the Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory. “And, more important, some MS treatments have been reported to worsen the disease of patients diagnosed with an IDD that is not classical MS.”

“While many IDDs that mimic multiple sclerosis are rare, correct and early diagnosis allows for early immunotherapy with immunosuppressants, rather than disease-modifying agents that are commonly used in treating MS,” Dr. Pittock says.

The researchers also found that persistence of the MOG antibody is associated with disease relapses, thus warranting relapse-preventing immunotherapy.

“We’ve learned that if patients are positive for MOG antibodies, and they have an attack (such as optic neuritis), and they persistently remain positive [for the MOG antibodies] when tested six to 12 months later, they have a higher likelihood for a relapse,” says Andrew McKeon, M.B., B.Ch., M.D., a clinical biochemist and co-director of Mayo’s Neuroimmunology Laboratory. “Certain drugs will prevent disease relapses and may reduce disability progression, so this diagnostic information will help health care providers and their patients with treatment options.”

Who should be tested?



Dr. Pittock says that any patients suddenly presenting with vision loss, significant disc edema, or recurrent optic neuritis should consider testing for both MOG and AQP4 antibodies.

Discovered at Mayo Clinic in 2004, the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody was the first biomarker associated with inflammatory demyelinating diseases. “The AQP4 test is a standard test in the evaluation of any patient undergoing an MS workup,” says Dr. Pittock. “And now, this second antibody — MOG — will be helpful because the presence of MOG antibodies indicates that a patient doesn’t have MS.”

Dr. McKeon agrees and adds, “The combination of these two tests — the AQP4 and MOG antibodies — allows for the most comprehensive evaluation for patients recently diagnosed with demyelinating diseases.”

Also, one might think that because the spinal cord can be affected with certain IDDs that the test is performed with spinal fluid, but it is not. “Only serum — blood — is necessary,” says Dr. McKeon. Why? “Testing for either AQP4 or MOG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alone will miss positive patients; therefore, MOG antibody testing is not offered on CSF.”

Collaboration with the University of Oxford



The Mayo researchers worked extensively with Patrick Waters, Ph.D., co-director of the University of Oxford Autoimmune Neurology Diagnostic Laboratory.

“The Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory has been developing this test in the U.S. for three years,” says Dr. Pittock. “We’ve collaborated with experts at Oxford University in MOG antibody testing to optimize our assay.”

Both the MOG and AQP4 tests are available to Mayo Clinic patients and health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, the global reference laboratory of Mayo Clinic.

Dr. Sean Pittock is the Marilyn A. Park and Moon S. Park, M.D., Director of the Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Autoimmune Neurology.

 About the MOG-IgG test (test ID: MOGFS)

 For inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDDs), the MOG-IgG test is appropriate for diagnosing IDDs with similar characteristics to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs), including optic neuritis (single or bilateral) and transverse myelitis. The test also can help diagnose neuromyelitis optica, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and the prediction of a relapsing disease.

Most importantly, the test allows distinction of NMOSD, ADEM, optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis from multiple sclerosis early in the course of a disease.

The MOG-IgG test uses serum — not spinal fluid — and is a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting assay, the first of its kind in the U.S.

150,"Targeting iron metabolism in immune system cells may offer a new approach for treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) -- the most common form of the chronic autoimmune disease lupus.

A multidisciplinary team of investigators at Vanderbilt University Medical Center has discovered that blocking an iron uptake receptor reduces disease pathology and promotes the activity of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells in a mouse model of SLE. The findings were published Jan. 13 in the journal Science Immunology.

Lupus, including SLE, occurs when the immune system attacks a person's own healthy tissues, causing pain, inflammation and tissue damage. Lupus most commonly affects skin, joints, brain, lungs, kidneys and blood vessels. About 1.5 million Americans and 5 million people worldwide have a form of lupus, according to the Lupus Foundation of America.

Treatments for lupus aim to control symptoms, reduce immune system attack of tissues, and protect organs from damage. Only one targeted biologic agent has been approved for treating SLE, belimumab in 2011.

""It has been a real challenge to come up with new therapies for lupus,"" said Jeffrey Rathmell, PhD, professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology and Cornelius Vanderbilt Chair in Immunobiology. ""The patient population and the disease are heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to design and conduct clinical trials.""

Rathmell's group has had a long-standing interest in lupus as part of a broader effort to understand mechanisms of autoimmunity.

When postdoctoral fellow Kelsey Voss, PhD, began studying T cell metabolism in lupus, she noticed that iron appeared to be a ""common denominator in many of the problems in T cells,"" she said. She was also intrigued by the finding that T cells from patients with lupus have high iron levels, even though patients are often anemic.

""It was not clear why the T cells were high in iron, or what that meant,"" said Voss, first author of the Science Immunology paper.

To explore T cell iron metabolism in lupus, Voss and Rathmell drew on the expertise of other investigators at VUMC:
• Eric Skaar, PhD, and his team are experienced in the study of iron and other metals;
• Amy Major, PhD, and her group provided a mouse model of SLE; and
• Michelle Ormseth, MD, MSCI, and her team recruited patients with SLE to provide blood samples.

First, Voss used a CRISPR genome editing screen to evaluate iron-handling genes in T cells. She identified the transferrin receptor, which imports iron into cells, as critical for inflammatory T cells and inhibitory for anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells.

The researchers found that the transferrin receptor was more highly expressed on T cells from SLE-prone mice and T cells from patients with SLE, which caused the cells to accumulate too much iron.

""We see a lot of complications coming from that -- the mitochondria don't function properly, and other signaling pathways are altered,"" Voss said.

An antibody that blocks the transferrin receptor reduced intracellular iron levels, inhibited inflammatory T cell activity, and enhanced regulatory T cell activity. Treatment of SLE-prone mice with the antibody reduced kidney and liver pathology and increased production of the anti-inflammatory factor, IL-10.

""It was really surprising and exciting to find different effects of the transferrin receptor in different types of T cells,"" Voss said. ""If you're trying to target an autoimmune disease by affecting T cell function, you want to inhibit inflammatory T cells but not harm regulatory T cells. That's exactly what targeting the transferrin receptor did.""

In T cells from patients with lupus, expression of the transferrin receptor correlated with disease severity, and blocking the receptor in vitro enhanced production of IL-10.

The researchers are interested in developing transferrin receptor antibodies that bind specifically to T cells, to avoid any potential off-target effects (the transferrin receptor mediates iron uptake in many cell types). They are also interested in studying the details of their unexpected discovery that blocking the transferrin receptor enhances regulatory T cell activity.

Skaar is the Ernest W. Goodpasture Professor of Pathology and director of the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation. Major, associate professor of Medicine, and Ormseth, assistant professor of Medicine, are faculty members in the Division of Rheumatology and Immunology. Rathmell is the director of the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology.

152,"Although about 10 percent of school-aged children in the United States have asthma, there are few comprehensive U.S. guidelines for treating pediatric asthma. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick, a new guideline from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), offers a user-friendly ""operational document."" It helps health care professionals understand which controller treatments are right for which age groups and identifies when a step up is needed.

""There is nothing like the Pediatric Asthma Yardstick in the current literature,"" says allergist Bradley Chipps, MD, ACAAI president and lead author of the paper. ""We created the yardstick because there are many options for treating pediatric asthma. It's a roadmap for how to move forward with kids whose asthma is not under control. The yardstick describes controller treatments at different levels of severity for all ages, the choices available for parents for their child and how to step up therapy.""

The diagnosis and management of asthma in children differs from that in adults. Differences also exist between the three age groups addressed in the yardstick -- adolescents, 12-18 years old; school-age children, 6-11 years old; infants and young children, 5 years old and under.

""Differences in diagnosis and management of asthma in children reflect differences in development of their respiratory systems, particularly for younger children,"" says Leonard Bacharier, MD, co-author of the yardstick. ""Other factors include challenges related to daily activities and emotional and social concerns, particularly for adolescents. Comorbid conditions and non-adherence with treatment (eg; due to the stigma of having a chronic condition and taking medicine) can affect outcomes for older children.""

Although asthma often begins in early childhood, diagnosing asthma in the very young child is challenging because it is based largely on symptoms and is not easily confirmed by objective testing, such as lung function. Additionally, symptoms, notably wheezing and coughing, often are related to, or occur with, common viral infections. Pediatric data for medicines are limited and robust clinical studies attesting to efficacy and safety of asthma medications are few.

""The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick is a practical resource for identifying children with uncontrolled asthma who need a step-up in controller medicine,"" says Dr Chipps. ""It describes how to start and/or adjust controller therapy based on the options that are currently available for children, from infants to 18 years of age.

156,"Actor Tom Holland (pictured above) announced he’s taking a break from social media because of the negative effects it’s having on his mental health. Ernesto Ruscio/GC Images/Getty Images
• Actor Tom Holland is the latest celebrity to announce a break from social media.
• Experts and research are mixed on how much social media affects mental health. But mental health providers and one recent study indicate that even a short break from it can be beneficial.
• Mental health providers hope that the increased prevalence of celebrities, like Holland, opening up about their mental health helps further break down the stigma. Actor Tim Holland hasn’t been on social media much in recent weeks. But he re-emerged Sunday to say hello and goodbye (for now, at least). The star of Spiderman: No Way Home announced he was taking a break from social media in a three-minute video on Instagram, where he has 67.8 million followers. “I have taken a break from social media for my mental health because I find Instagram and Twitter to be overstimulating, to be overwhelming,” said Holland, 26. “I get caught up, and I spiral when I read things about me online, and ultimately, it’s very detrimental to my mental state. So, I decided to take a step back and delete the app.” Holland also plugged UK-based mental health resource Stem4, which his organization The Brothers Trust supports. “There is an awful stigma against mental health and I know that asking for help and seeking help isn’t something we should be ashamed of,” Holland said. Holland didn’t indicate when he’d return, only that he’d, speak to his fans “soon.” Professional skateboarder Shane O’Neill called him a “legend” in the comments. “Man, you’re an inspiration to so many. But what matters is your physical and mental health, so take care and come back better than ever,” replied wrestler Ricochet. And Justin Beiber said, “Love you, man.” Holland is one of several celebs who have logged off of social media — temporarily or permanently — in recent years to protect or improve their mental health. Justin Bieber’s wife, model Hailey Bieber left Twitter and said she only checked Instagram on weekends, in 2021. Musician Shawn Mendes also took a social media break for his mental health in 2021 and canceled his 2022 tour. “Things work better when we take intentional time to unplug, pause and reflect,” says Kiana Shelton, LCSW, with Mindpath Health: “Someone will always have an opinion about you and that can emotionally take a toll, even if you do have a strong sense of self.” Shelton says celebs may be under a larger microscope and face more scrutiny online but feels anyone can benefit from a social media detox. She and other mental health providers discussed the pros and cons of social media breaks and how to log off.

Mental health issues may frequently get pinned on social media. But is it warranted? The data is mixed. 1,800 people ages 19 to 32 suggested a strong link between social media use and sleep disruption. In a 2021 whistleblower report, Frances Haugen provided documentation that Facebook and Instagram knew that Instagram knew its content was exacerbating eating disorders and mental health issues for teenage girls. The report also said that Facebook’s algorithm elevated content that made people angry because it was more engaging, keeping people on the site and increasing the potential for profits. But a 2019 study suggested that adults who used social media were less at-risk for psychological distress, which is often associated with anxiety disorders and depression. Research indicated that concerns about social media use and mental health may be misplaced. Amira Johnson, LMSW, concedes social media isn’t all bad, but it can be bad enough to prompt individuals to re-evaluate the value it has in their lives. “In many cases, social platforms can offer encouraging communities for people to connect with like-minded individuals, find new friends, and open themselves up to new information and ideas,” Johnson says. “But it can also be a hotspot for…an incessant amount of negative comments…Social media and the negativity, judgment, and hate-filled comments that come with it can take a toll on anyone’s mental well-being.”

A study published in May of 2022 suggested that even a one-week layoff from social media can improve mental well-being, depression, and anxiety. Johnson says other benefits may include:
• decreased FOMO (fear of missing out) from looking at other people’s vacations and milestones
• reduced information overload from seeing bad news unfold in real-time
• ability to live in the moment “When I talk to my clients after they’ve taken a social media detox, it’s as if they’re different people,” Johnson says. “Unchaining themselves from social feeds allows for a mental boost where you can just enjoy life…and stop comparing yourself to others you don’t even know but just see on a small screen.”

How to tell if you could use a social media break Though anyone can take a social media break for any reason, Don Grant, PhD, MA, MFA, DAC, SUDCC IV, particularly recommends it for people who:
• constantly negatively compare themselves to others online
• feel less confident, content, or happy after scrolling social media
• are losing sleep from compulsively viewing or posting content
• are affected emotionally hours or even days after engaging on social media “Any of these experiences can take a serious hit to your self-esteem, healthy emotional homeostasis, physical well-being, and overall happiness,” says Grant, the executive director of outpatient services for Newport Healthcare. That said, Shelton cautions that it’s important not to see social media breaks as a cure-all for mental health issues. She says if you are still feeling the emotions that triggered the break while you’re on it or when you return, you may need more help. She suggests seeking a mental health provider by:
• searching online for a therapist in your area

How to take a social media break The first rule of taking a social media break is that you make the rules, says Dr. Nina Vasan, the chief medical officer at Real. “You get to create the rules for how long it is, the guidelines around it, and what you share with others,” Vasan says.
• State your reason for taking the break
• Decide on the duration and if you’re detoxing from specific platforms or all of them
• Be kind to yourself if you slip up “I think it is important when people are taking a break to engage in mindful reflection around understanding the specific aspects of social media and why they need a break,” Vasan says. “You can use this reflection to personalize the break to fit your own needs.” This customization includes the duration, which Vasan says is highly individual. “In the same way that someone can feel refreshed from a one-day vacation, while someone else needs one week or one month to feel fully rejuvenated, the amount of time away from social media totally depends on you and what you need.,” she says. Vasan says announcing that you’re taking a break and how else to reach you can reduce confusion and worry from others. It may also help you feel less isolated. Social media is a large part of many people’s lives. You may be unable to resist the urge to log on or do so accidentally. “Don’t judge yourself, and don’t feel like you fully have to dive into social media if you slipped,” Vasan says.

Can celebrities help break down the stigma around mental health? Mental health challenges have surged since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. reported a 25 percent increase in anxiety and depression worldwide. Young people have notably been affected. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on youth mental health, saying it was exacerbated by the pandemic, in December of 2021. Holland isn’t the only one speaking out about mental health and the need to take a break. Last summer, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles pulled out of the all-around and team competitions, citing mental health issues. Champion tennis player Naomi Osaka expressed her need for a break after losing in the U.S. Open in 2021. Grant says these conversations and announcements are breaking down the stigma around mental health. “Mental health already has a looming stigma where people are embarrassed or ashamed to address it and talk about their personal experiences,” Grant says. “Over the years, it has definitely become more normalized due to the fact that more public figures have decided to be more open about their own experiences.” Grant says celebrities’ large platforms reach millions and show individuals they aren’t alone. “It allows for those who idolize them to realize they are human just like the rest of us,” Grant says. “It lets people know that maintaining your mental health is important, whether you’re an average human or have 1 million social followers.” And Grant believes this message can be life-saving. “Going forward, I hope it encourages more people to get the help and support they may need,” he says. “The more we talk about mental health openly, the more we can save lives.”",0
157,"People who reported smoking or vaping prior to their hospitalization for COVID-19 were more likely than their counterparts who did not smoke or vape to experience severe complications, including death, from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings are from a new study based on data from the American Heart Association's COVID-19 CVD Registry and published in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed, open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science.

Researchers examined data on people over 18 years of age who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in 107 registry-participating hospitals across the nation between January 2020 to March 2021. Smoking status was self-reported and people were classified as smoking if they reported currently using either traditional, combustible cigarettes or e-cigarette products, with no distinction between the two and no information on duration of smoking or former smoking status. For the final analysis, records were selected for 4,086 people with a 1:2 ratio of people who smoked (1,362) to people who did not smoke (2,724), with the two groups matched for no statistically significant difference in age, sex, race, medical history or medication.

The study findings indicate smoking or vaping are associated with more severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, race or medical history:
• People who reported smoking were 45% more likely to die and 39% more likely to receive mechanical ventilation when compared with those who did not smoke.
• Although the excessive risk due to smoking was independent of medical history and medication use, smoking was a stronger risk factor for death in people between 18-59 years of age and those who were white or had obesity.

""In general, people who smoke or vape tend to have a higher prevalence of other health conditions and risk factors that could play a role in how they are impacted by COVID-19. However, the robust and significant increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 seen in our study, independent of medical history and medication use and particularly among young individuals, underscores the urgent need for extensive public health interventions such as anti-smoking campaigns and increased access to cessation therapy, especially in the age of COVID,"" said the study's senior author, Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D., FAHA, a professor of medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. ""These findings provide the clearest evidence to date that people who smoke or vape have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and dying as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.""

Bhatnagar is co-director of the American Heart Association's Tobacco Center for Regulatory Science which supported the study in part with funding from the U. S. National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration research grants.

The BRD8 protein linked to another protein named P53 is essential in the body's natural defense against cancer. In glioblastoma, P53 is often damaged, leading to uncontrolled tumor growth. However, the CSHL team found that BRD8 was inappropriately active in glioblastoma, shutting down P53's critical anticancer defenses.

When scientists deactivated BRD8 using genome editing, P53's anticancer defenses were restored, and the tumors stopped growing in mice. This finding suggests that drugs targeting the heart of BRD8 could work against glioblastoma, turning a deadly brain cancer into a treatable disease.",1
162,"Tuberculosis (TB), an ancient disease, is the leading infectious cause of death globally, yet the world’s only licensed TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), was developed a century ago. Given to infants via a needle placed just under the skin, BCG protects babies from a form of the disease called disseminated TB but is far less effective at preventing pulmonary TB, the major cause of illness and deaths, in teens or adults.

Now, researchers from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and their colleagues have shown that simply changing the dose and route of administration from intradermal (ID) to intravenous (IV) greatly increases the vaccine’s ability to protect rhesus macaques from infection following exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium that causes TB. The findings provide a new understanding of the mechanisms of BCG-elicited protection against tuberculosis infection and disease. In addition, the findings support investigation of IV BCG administration in clinical trials to determine whether this route improves its effectiveness in teens and adults.

Study investigators at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center were led by Robert A. Seder, M.D., and Mario Roederer, Ph.D. Their collaborators included JoAnne L. Flynn, Ph.D., of University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

To control Mtb infection and prevent clinical disease, a TB vaccine must elicit strong, sustained responses from the immune system’s T cells, specifically those in the lungs. However, the standard, ID, route of BCG administration may not generate enough of these critical cells in the lungs. The NIAID researchers and their colleagues hypothesized that administration of BCG by IV or aerosol (AE) routes would overcome this hurdle and thus confer substantially better protection from infection and/or disease in rhesus macaques following challenge with virulent Mtb.

In their study, groups of animals received the BGC vaccine by ID, AE or IV routes. The scientists assessed immune responses in blood and in fluid drawn from the lungs for a 24-week period following vaccination. IV BCG vaccination resulted in the highest durable levels of T cells in the blood and lungs.

Six months after vaccination, the researchers exposed groups of vaccinated rhesus macaques (immunized via ID, AE or IV routes) and a group of unvaccinated macaques to a virulent strain of Mtb by introducing the bacteria directly into the animals’ lungs. They then tracked the infection and disease development over three months. Nine out of 10 animals vaccinated with IV BCG were highly protected; six showed no detectable infection in any tissue tested and three had only very low counts of Mtb bacteria in lung tissue. All unvaccinated animals and those immunized via ID or AE routes showed signs of significantly greater infection.

The investigators concluded that IV BCG conferred an unprecedented degree of protection in an animal model of severe TB and “represents a major step forward in the field of TB vaccine research.”

163,"For previously healthy children, brain infections are rare. But about one out of every 10,000 people who are exposed to common viruses like herpes simplex or influenza will develop a potentially deadly disease, encephalitis.

Rockefeller's Jean-Laurent Casanova has identified mutations in a single gene that may explain what goes wrong in cases of encephalitis of the brain stem, the part of the brain that controls many basic functions including heart rate and breathing. Shen-Ying Zhang, assistant professor of clinical investigation in the Casanova lab, evaluated seven children from unrelated families who had been exposed to a common virus (herpes simplex virus 1, influenza virus, or norovirus) and developed a life-threatening or lethal infection of the brain stem. The scientists discovered mutations in a gene called DBR1, which is responsible for producing a protein that helps process the loops formed in RNA during a step called mRNA splicing. Without it, immunity to viruses is selectively impaired in the brain stem. Casanova's experiments, published in Cell, point to an almost complete loss of DBR1 as the culprit, enabling brain stem virus invasion in all seven patients. The findings also reveal an unexpected connection between an RNA processing mechanism and protective immunity in a specific region of the brain.

The study is a new example of the Casanova lab's ongoing work to identify mutations that underlie infectious diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. Previous work has found genetic factors that cause increased vulnerability to staph infections, the flu, and fungal infections, among others.",0

174,"Mistletoe extract has been widely used to support cancer therapy and improve quality of life, but there has been a lack of clinical trials and data to support its use. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center completed what is believed to be the first phase I trial of intravenous Helixor M in the U.S. aimed at determining dosing for subsequent clinical trials and to evaluate safety.

The findings from the small study were reported online Feb. 9 in Cancer Research Communications.

The trial's purpose was to evaluate the drug's safety, but the researchers, led by Channing Paller, M.D., associate professor of oncology, also documented improved quality of life and some disease control.

Mistletoe extract (ME), known as Helixor M, was studied in 21 patients with advanced and treatment-resistant cancers of various types. The phase I trial used dose escalation to determine the maximum dose that could be safely tolerated by patients. ME was delivered intravenously three times per week until disease progression or until toxicity. The study concluded that dose to be 600 milligrams of ME.

The median follow-up duration on mistletoe was 15.3 weeks. Stable disease was observed in five patients and lasted, on average, for 15 weeks. Tumors in three participants decreased in size, and remained stable for two to five months, however, this did not meet official criteria for partial response. Patients also reported overall improved quality of life via a questionnaire. The most common side effects reported were fatigue, nausea, and chills and they were noted as manageable.

""Intravenous mistletoe demonstrated manageable toxicities with disease control and improved quality of life in this group of patients, who had already received multiple cancer therapies,"" says Paller, adding that additional phase II studies in combination with chemotherapy are the next step, pending additional funding.

In addition, Paller says, laboratory research to better decipher ME's mechanisms are needed, as the cytokines (cell-signaling proteins) measured in this study are preliminary and hypothesis generating.

Mistletoe extract is a semi-parasitic plant with several active ingredients that, in preclinical studies, appear to directly cause the death of tumor cells and stimulate an immune response. It has been used in Europe for several decades as a complementary medicine approach to cancer treatment alone or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but it has not been evaluated in clinical trials. ME is not currently FDA approved for cancer treatment in the U.S. but is listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia and is offered in integrative care clinics.

In addition to Paller, other researchers included Lin Wang, Wei Fu, Rajedra Kumar, Jennifer N. Durham, Nilofer S. Azad, Daniel A. Laheru, Ilene Browner, Sushant K.

175,"Lung cancer cells use antioxidants, endogenous or dietary, to spread in the body by activating a protein called BACH1 and increasing the uptake and use of sugar, Swedish and American researchers report in two independent studies. The studies, which are published in the eminent scientific journal Cell, pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for lung cancer.

It is a known fact that cancer cells, owing to their special metabolism, are exposed to oxidative stress caused by free oxygen radicals. It is also well-known that cancer cells are characterised by the high uptake and use of glucose, or sugar, and that this is one of many factors that govern their ability to divide and metastasise. Studying mice and human tissue, two independent research teams have now discovered how these circumstances interact when cancer cells metastasise to other parts of the body.

The process begins when the cancer cells manage to reduce their oxidative stress, which can happen in one of two ways: the cancer cells can either obtain antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C or E, from the diet, or synthesise their own. In about one in every three cases of lung cancer, the tumour cells have special mutations, linked to the NRF2 and KEAP1 genes, which enable them to start producing their own antioxidants.

It is when the oxidative stress has subsided that the fundamental process of the new discovery occurs: the protein BACH1 is stabilised and accumulates in the cancer cells. This protein presses several start buttons in the cancer cell which stimulates metastasis mechanisms, including one that orders the cancer cell to increase both the metabolism of glucose into cell fuel and lactic acid, and the stockpiling of glucose from the blood stream. The higher rate of glucose use then greatly boosts the ability of the cancer cells to spread.

""There is nothing to suggest, however, that the amount of glucose in the blood has anything to do with this; rather, it is the tumour cells' ability to utilise glucose that is essential to the accelerating metastasis,"" says Martin Bergo, professor at the Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at Karolinska Institutet, who led the Swedish study.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The most life-threatening aspect of lung cancer is metastasis.

""We now have important new information on lung cancer metastasis, making it possible for us to develop new treatments, such as ones based on inhibiting BACH1,"" says Professor Bergo. ""In this present study, we show that the aggressive metastasising induced by antioxidants can be blocked by stopping the production of BACH1 or by using drugs that suppress the breakdown of sugar. Our American colleagues show how inhibiting another enzyme, heme oxygenase, which is linked to BACH1, can also curb the metastasis process.""

Professor Bergo and his Swedish colleagues have previously shown that antioxidants, such as vitamin E, in dietary supplement doses accelerate tumour growth. When the first studies to show this were presented in 2014 they drew a great deal of media attention and sparked a fierce debate, since it was generally believed that antioxidant supplements had beneficial effects on cancer. What the researchers have done now is to explain how antioxidants go about expediting the course of the disease -- specifically, in the case of the present study, lung cancer.

""This is one of the most exciting findings we've made,"" says Volkan Sayin, assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg, and co-corresponding author. ""Our results also provide a new explanation for how the so-called Warburg effect is activated. The Warburg effect describes how cancer cells absorb sugar and convert it into energy and lactic acid under normal aerobic conditions. Since this is one of the most well-known hallmarks of cancer, our results provide a crucial new piece in the oncological puzzle.""

The Swedish study was conducted at Karolinska Institutet and Gothenburg University, whereas the American study was conducted at New York University. The pair of studies, as well as a ""Preview"" commenting on the new findings, are published at the same time in the journal Cell.

With a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, the court is expected to rule on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization this month, a decision that could end Americans’ constitutional right to get an abortion.

Abortion has been legal nationwide since 1973, due to the decision in the Roe v. Wade case. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that people had a constitutional right to an abortion before a fetus reached viability in that case. Further decisions said that the state could not put undue burdens on people seeking abortions.

But in May, a draft document published by Politico found that justices are likely to overrule Roe v. Wade which will lead to a near-total ban on abortion in numerous states including Texas.

As a result, abortion providers, people running abortion funds, and other reproductive rights groups have started to prepare for life after Roe v. Wade.

Life on the front lines of abortion care

In the Texas Rio Grande Valley, the future of abortion care is in the hands of people like Zaena Zamora, the executive director of the Rio Grande-based abortion fund Frontera Fund.

The Frontera Fund, which is staffed by just two people and a small group of volunteers, has kept up with the post-SB8 demand.

Zamora said the abortion fund has seen a surge in pregnant Texans needing to travel out of state to get an abortion. For people traveling from southern Texas, that means money for ground travel, air travel, lodging, food vouchers, rideshare costs, and child care vouchers.

To reach another state from the Rio Grande Valley, the drive can easily take over 6 hours to get to Louisiana and up to 12 hours to get to New Mexico.

For the entire year of 2020, the Frontera Fund spent about $4,000 helping pregnant people get an abortion.

For just the month of February this year, the organization spent close to $13,000 helping people travel out of state for abortion care.

But Zamora and her team know things could get worse quickly if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.

If it falls, 26 states — including Texas — are poised to pass bans and restrictions that will outlaw abortion in some way, shape, or form. This means pregnant people in Texas seeking an abortion will have to travel further and spend even more money on abortion care.

While a significant number of states plan on restricting or banning abortion access, multiple states are passing laws with the goal of protecting reproductive rights.

These states are likely to become destinations for people seeking abortions.

Already, the Frontera Fund has sent patients as far as Baltimore, Washington DC, and Virginia — anywhere they can get an appointment.

“The amount of funding that we are providing per person has skyrocketed astronomically because of the additional travel costs associated now with getting an abortion,” Zamora said.

If Roe v. Wade is overturned, the Frontera Fund expects to see a 20 percent increase in call volume and a 20 percent increase in their direct support budget to send people to states that reliably offer abortion care.

Some progressive states like California and New York are planning to set aside money to help out-of-state patients traveling for an abortion.

California has long been an abortion sanctuary for out-of-state people seeking an abortion.

The Guttmacher Institute estimates there will be a 3,000 percent increase in patients whose nearest clinic would be in California. This could result in an increase from 46,000 to 1.4 million people who wind up traveling to California for abortion care.

Jessica Pinckney, Access Reproductive Justice’s executive director, is working with the California Future of Abortion Council on multiple pieces of legislation that would help improve access to abortion in California in the event Roe is overturned.

One of California’s bills, SB 1142, is asking for a $20 million contribution from the state to provide practical support — like child care, lodging, travel, and food — to anyone getting an abortion in California.

“We hope that would really be able to shore up our ability to provide practical support to folks who are coming from other states, as well as those who are in California trying to access care,” Pinckney said.

Another bill, AB 2134, aims to fund abortion clinics that provide free care to low-income people whose insurance does not cover abortion and other reproductive health services.

Both of California’s bills, AB 2134 and SB 1142, are expected to move through the legislative process this summer and be voted on by the end of summer.

The Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion care except in cases of rape, incest, or if the pregnant person’s life is endangered. But some states, like California, use their Medicaid funds to cover abortion care.

That said, even though California’s Medicaid program Medi-Cal covers abortion, the coverage does not apply to out-of-state callers.

And while some states require private insurers to cover abortion care, many states have some restrictions against abortion coverage in insurance.

Similarly, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut are approving legislation that will protect the right to abortion and provide support for out-of-state patients traveling for care.

Abortion funds have become a go-to way for people to afford and navigate travel to other states for abortion.

These nonprofit organizations are funded by individuals and organizations that are passionate about helping people that need to access abortion. They provide financial and logistical assistance to anyone who cannot afford an abortion and people from all over the globe can donate.

Zamora said that the Frontera Fund has seen bursts of what she calls “rage giving,” an uptick in funds whenever a new abortion restriction takes effect.

“People are just angry and they need to do something, right, so they give money to help with that and we’re very fortunate to be recipients of a lot of rage giving,” Zamora said.

According to the National Network of Abortion Funds, there are over 90 organizations scattered across the country. Most, if not all, are currently working to ensure they have the infrastructure in place to support the surge in callers that are expected if and when Roe v. Wade is overturned.

The Frontera Fund is hiring a third staff member, recruiting more volunteers, and ramping up its fundraising efforts in anticipation of the overruling.

“We’re a tiny organization and we have a lot of big things to do — and we get them done, but there’s a lot of growing pains right now,” Zamora said.

Access Reproductive Justice, the only statewide abortion fund in California operating outside of clinics, supported people who called in from 18 states in 2021. They expect to see a surge in out-of-state patients coming to California if Roe is gutted.

Pinckney said Access Reproductive Justice has the infrastructure in place to support a surge in out-of-state patients — it’s something they’ve been working toward for decades. They anticipate that the number of out-of-state people calling for help will increase by 30 percent to 50 percent, if not more.

Last year, they supported 500 people calling for care, both in and out of state. And if Roe v. Wade is overturned, they expect that number to at least double to 1,000 people.

“We have been preparing for this moment and there are systems and structures already in place to support folks in getting from one state to another to get the support they need,” Pinckney said.

Pinckney added that abortion funds vary in how they financially support people who call in for help. Most funds have a monthly budget to support callers. Once that runs out, the helpline closes until the next month.

The group can make adjustments so people who call in can still get help.

“Abortion funding is an art, not a science, so we make a lot of adjustments and whatnot in real-time, as we cannot predict just how large or small an influx in callers might be, or when it might occur,” Pinckney said.

If Access Reproductive Justice hits its limit, Pinckney and her team assess if funds can be pulled from other work. If for some reason that isn’t possible, they direct callers to other abortion funds across the country that can provide support — “although we’ve never found ourselves in a situation quite like that,” Pinckney said.

There are over 700 clinics scattered across the country that provide a variety of care services, including abortion pills, abortion procedures, abortion referrals, ultrasounds, and post-abortion follow-up care.

For years, laws that restricted abortion rights have led to clinic closures nationwide.

As of 2017, at least 89 percent of counties in the country do not offer abortion care services, and past restrictions have made it near impossible for many pregnant people to find care in their communities, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

In May 2017 there were 6 states that only had one remaining clinic. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), if Roe v. Wade is overturned, more clinics will close, leaving some states with no clinics.

With abortion likely to be banned in many states, many of these clinics are working to figure out how to connect patients to services in other states.

Planned Parenthood, which operates over 600 health centers across the country, has been expanding its patient navigation efforts to help pregnant people in restrictive states figure out where and how they can get an abortion.

When a patient calls a clinic in Texas, for instance, the health center will help the patient secure an out-of-state appointment along with transportation, lodging, child care, and funding for the abortion itself in a nearby state that permits the procedure.

“Texas presents a case study of what we’re going to see in these 26 other states,” Lauren Kokum, the director of affiliate communications at Planned Parenthood, told Healthline.

Moving patients and helping them navigate the healthcare and legal systems has always been a part of accessing abortion care.

According to Erin Grant, the deputy director at Abortion Care Network, clinics are all too familiar with working with very little to provide services.

“We are definitely seeing clinics be their resilient selves — find staff, train staff, and find really creative solutions to deliver the care that patients need,” said Grant.

According to Grant, the interworking of clinics, abortion funds, and patient support networks are there and may be key to providing abortion services for many.

Planned Parenthood says they are ramping up patient navigation services and working with abortion funds more closely to coordinate people’s abortion care journey every step of the way.

Planned Parenthood clinics in critical access points — such as those along the border of New Mexico and Colorado — are also bolstering their patient navigation efforts to coordinate care, travel, and lodging for the influx of patients, according to Kokum. They’re expanding their health centers, extending clinic hours, and training more providers.

Abortion provided via telemedicine has become more popular in recent years. Medication abortion now accounts for half of all abortions in the United States — a jump from 39 percent in 2017.

Research has shown that abortion pills are effective and can be safely taken at home in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

Online abortion pill providers are planning to work within state restrictions and bans to get pills to people who need them.

Honeybee Health, an online pharmacy that ships the pills, says that they will only ship to patients in states where the medications are legal. But they’re doing all they can to ensure access — where it’s legal — remains fast and accessible to support the influx of patients traveling for care.

They’ve also teamed up with abortion funds to help people who can’t afford the medication.

Choix, which provides telehealth abortion medication to people in Colorado, California, and Illinois, is prepared to scale up its services to meet the increased demand they expect to see from out-of-state patients seeking telehealth care from the states it serves.

AidAccess, an organization based in the Netherlands that sends abortion pills to patients regardless of state law, has started prescribing abortion pills to people who would like to have the medications on hand just in case they eventually have an unintended pregnancy.

In addition to helping people get access to pills to end a pregnancy, telehealth medication can also help people cut down on the amount of time they would need to spend with a healthcare professional in person.

Planned Parenthood’s sites and other clinics say they are ramping up telehealth services to reduce the amount of time patients need to spend at a clinic along with the amount of in-person appointments they have to go to.

So instead of traveling to three in-person appointments, for example, patients will only need to travel for one or two, said Kokum.

“We’re doing whatever we can in order to meet the patient demand [in access points],” Kokum said.

Restrictions may limit the effect of telehealth providers

Telemedicine abortions are restricted in 13 states and banned in 6.

At least 20 states are expected to pass stricter restrictions on medication abortion via telehealth.

Proposed bills in 10 states would require patients to pick up the pills from a healthcare facility, rather than receiving them by mail. Proposed bills in four other states would ban telehealth consultations and require patients to take the pills under a provider’s watch.

However, if Roe v. Wade is overturned and these states ban abortion fully, then telehealth appointments for abortion in those states will be illegal.

Providers can only consult with a patient in the state where they, the provider, are licensed and the patient is based. The pharmacies can only ship to patients where the pills are legal, according to Kristen Moore, director of the EMAA Project, an organization that works to expand access to medication abortion.

Patients in states that ban abortion could potentially travel to a nearby state that permits medication abortion via telehealth, do a telehealth appointment from there, and have them shipped to a mailing address in that state (or look into mail forwarding).

But people may still face legal risks if they have a complication.

While people are legally allowed to take the pills at home, no matter where they live, if they have some type of medical complication and need to go to the emergency room, a healthcare professional in a state like Ohio or Texas that bans the pills could turn them in, if the patient tells them that they took the pills.

Bleeding due to a miscarriage versus bleeding due to abortion via medication may appear similar or indistinguishable in a medical setting.

“To be clear, that healthcare provider will have no evidence that [an abortion] is what happened. They can just make that person’s life a living hell,” Moore said.

If Roe vs. Wade is overruled, an estimated 36 million people will be at risk of losing access to reproductive care, according to Planned Parenthood.

Even with all the work being done by clinics, abortion funds, and patient support networks, getting an abortion is about to get a lot more difficult for millions of people in the United States.

That means many people will opt for the other two options: self-managing an abortion or carrying the pregnancy to term.

“No state can absorb the amount of people experiencing pregnancy that may be looking for care,” Grant said.

And just because a government bans abortion does not mean that people are not going to try to get one.

Data from the Guttmacher Institute shows that abortion rates are similar in countries where the procedure is restricted and where it is legal.

“While states may make abortions illegal or criminalize abortion providers or patients, they have done nothing to the human right and need for abortion,” Grant said.",0
179,"Iron is an essential element for life. Red blood cells rely on iron to create heme and hemoglobin, the protein required to transport oxygen in our body. Iron is transported and shuttled to the right places in the body through an elaborate series of reactions and processes -- but when iron transportation goes wrong, the result can be too little or too much iron, resulting in diseases such as iron deficiency anemia (too little), hemochromatosis (too much) or sideroblastic anemia (too much in the wrong organelle). In a paper published May 12 in Science, investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, in collaboration with colleagues at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, describe a compound known as Hinokitiol which can correct iron-delivery defects in preclinical models. Their study lays the groundwork for investigating Hinkitiol's full potential beyond cellular and model organisms.

""The long-term therapeutic implications of our work with Hinokitiol points to potentially using this chemical to correct anemias caused by genetic deficiencies of iron transporters required for normal red cell formation,"" said co-corresponding author Barry Paw, MD, PhD, of BWH's Division of Hematology. ""At the same time, Hinokitiol has the potential to correct iron-overload syndromes, such as hemochromatosis. More extensive clinical trials are necessary to work out the full potential of Hinokitiol and to identify potential toxicities that we have not identified using preclinical models.""

Hinokitiol is a natural product found in the wood of trees. Originally isolated from the Taiwanese hinoki tree, this small molecule is also found in cedar wood.

The research team initially studied the properties of Hinokitiol in yeast -- a classic model organism for studying biological processes, such as iron transport, that have been conserved across evolution. Collaborators at University of Illinois found that the compound could transport iron across the yeast cellular membrane in mutant yeasts lacking their major iron uptake transporters. BWH investigators provided mouse erythroid (red) blood cells as well as zebrafish mutants, both of which lacked the ability to transport iron. When the team administered Hinokitiol in these models as well as rodent models, they found that it remedied the blocked iron on the outside of the cells, or subcellular organelles, correcting anemia at the cellular level.

""We found that Hinokitiol can restore iron transport within cells, out of cells or both,"" said Paw. ""It can also promote iron gut absorption and the creation of hemoglobin in some of our models. These findings suggest that small molecules like Hinkitiol that can mimic the biological function of a missing protein may have potential for treating human diseases.""",0
180,"The CDC has endorsed a plan to allow people over age 65 and those who are immunocompromised to get a second dose of the COVID-19 bivalent booster. This backs the FDA's authorization Tuesday of the additional shot. ""Following FDA regulatory action, CDC has taken steps to simplify COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and allow more flexibility for people at higher risk who want the option of added protection from additional COVID-19 vaccine doses,"" the CDC said in a statement. The agency is following the recommendations made by its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that met earlier Wednesday. While there was no vote, the group reaffirmed its commitment to boosters overall, proposing that all Americans over age 6 who have not had a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine go ahead and get one. But most others who’ve already had the bivalent shot — which targets the original COVID strain and the two Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 -- should wait until the fall to get whatever updated vaccine is available. The panel did carve out exceptions for people over age 65 and those who are immunocompromised because they are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 complications, said Evelyn Twentyman, MD, MPH, the lead official in the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Policy Unit, during the meeting Wednesday. People over 65 can now choose to get a second bivalent mRNA booster shot as long as it has been at least 4 months since the last one, she said, and people who are immunocompromised also should have the flexibility to receive one or more additional bivalent boosters at least 2 months after an initial dose. Regardless of whether someone is unvaccinated, and regardless of how many single-strain COVID vaccines a person has previously received, they should get a mRNA bivalent shot, Twentyman said.. If you have already received a bivalent mRNA booster—made by either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna—""your vaccination is complete,” she said. “No doses indicated at this time, come back and see us in autumn of 2023.” The CDC is trying to encourage more people to get the updated COVID shot, as just 17% of Americans of any age have received a bivalent booster and only 43% of those age 65 and over.

The CDC followed the FDA's lead in its statement, phasing out the original single-strain COVID vaccine, saying it will no longer be recommended for use in the U.S. The CDC panel mostly followed the FDA’s guidance on who should get a booster, but many ACIP members expressed concern and confusion about what was being recommended for children. For children age 6 months to 4 years old, the CDC will offer tables to help doctors determine how many bivalent doses to give, depending on the child’s vaccination history. All children those ages should get at least two vaccine doses, one of which is bivalent, Twentyman said. For children in that age group who have already received a monovalent series and a bivalent dose, “their vaccination is complete,” she said. For 5-year-olds, the recommendations will be similar if they received a Pfizer monovalent series, but the shot regimen will have to be customized if they had previously received a Moderna shot, due to differences in the dosages. ACIP member Sarah S. Long, MD, a professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, said it was unclear why a set age couldn’t be established for COVID-19 vaccination, as it had been for other immunizations. “We picked 60 months for most immunizations in children,” Long said. “Immunologically there is not a difference between a 4-, a 5- and a 6-year old. ""There isn’t a reason to have all this unnecessary drama around those ages.” Long said , having the different ages would make it harder for pediatricians to appropriately stock vaccines. The CDC will provide more detailed guidance on its COVID-19 website soon, Twentyman said, and it will hold a call with health care professionals to discuss the updated recommendations on May 11. CDC and ACIP members both said they hoped to have an even simpler vaccine schedule by the fall, when it is anticipated that the FDA may have authorized a new updated bivalent vaccine that targets other COVID variants.",0
181,"UVA Health researchers and their collaborators have developed a better way to predict the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive, potentially deadly form of lung inflammation, for people of non-European ancestry.

Initial tests of the new, more inclusive tool revealed that it is better at predicting COPD risk for both African-Americans and heavy smokers than existing models that were based on genetic information largely collected from people of European ancestry. The tool's developers say their approach will allow doctors to better predict COPD risk for individuals of diverse ancestry in the United States and around the world.

""Our study demonstrates the possibility of learning from large-scale genetic studies performed primarily in European ancestry groups, and then developing prediction models that can be used for prediction of genetic risk in other ancestry groups,"" said researcher Ani W. Manichaikul, PhD, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ""While the current study focus on risk prediction for COPD, we are already looking to apply similar approaches to improve prediction of genetic risk for other diseases.""

While treatable, COPD is a leading cause of death in the United States and around the globe. Approximately 16 million Americans have COPD, which is a group of lung conditions that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The lung damage caused by COPD is irreversible and accumulates over time. That makes early detection and treatment especially important.

In recent years, doctors have been able to predict patients' genetic risk of developing COPD and other common diseases using what are called ""polygenic risk scores,"" or PRS. These look at the total number of naturally occurring gene variations a person has that predispose them to a disease -- in this case, COPD. To date, most large-scale genetic studies available for the study of disease risk have limited representation of certain ancestry groups, including African-American and Hispanic, yielding poorer prediction of disease risk for these groups.

Manichaikul and her collaborators sought to improve the ability to predict COPD by better reflecting the world's genetic diversity. To do so, they layered genetic measurements with other molecular measures from a diverse ancestry group that included a combination of European ancestry, African-American and Hispanic individuals from the United States. Building on these resources, they developed what they call ""PrediXcan-derived polygenic transcriptome risk score,"" or PTRS. This new approach incorporates much more information about the cumulative effects of gene variations in different groups of people. The result is a model that ""bears a more direct connection to underlying disease biology than standard PRS approaches,"" the researchers report in a new scientific paper.

The scientists put their new tool to the test by analyzing its ability to predict COPD in tens of thousands of participants in studies conducted by the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program sponsored by the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

PTRS, they found, was better at predicting COPD in African-Americans and better at predicting moderate to severe COPD in heavy, longtime smokers. Perhaps unsurprisingly (considering it was developed to better reflect non-European populations), PTRS was less effective than PRS in predicting COPD in people of European ancestry. But the availability of multiple ""crystal balls"" to predict COPD in different populations moves us an important step closer to true precision medicine -- medicine tailored to each individual.

""So far, we have shown that by building on genomic data combined with gene expression data from diverse ancestry individuals, we can improve prediction of genetic risk for some people,"" said Manichaikul, of UVA's Center for Public Health Genomics and Department of Public Health Sciences. ""Looking forward, we are excited to think about how we can build on other collections of molecular data from diverse ancestry individuals and keep working on improved approaches for prediction of genetic risk for other diseases.""

182,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ─ We humans like to think our DNA is well-protected in the nucleus of each cell. But it’s a hard life for the hard-working genetic code.

DNA can be damaged by a range of normal cellular activities, not to mention ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. The bad news is that damage, such as DNA double-strand breaks, is constantly occurring. But the good news is the human body has so-called damage response proteins to fix it.

Now, thanks to a new publication by Mayo Clinic researchers, scientists know more about these damage response proteins and how they do their job.

“This basic research is aimed at understanding how DNA damage response proteins work,” explains Georges Mer, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic biochemist. “We hope the knowledge gained from these studies might, in the long term, be beneficial from a therapeutic perspective, notably for cancer treatment.”

Certain types of radiation, such as gamma rays and X-rays, can cause breaks in both strands of DNA. If it’s unfixable, the damage can trigger a cell to die. But Dr. Mer and team examined the way in which these breaks can trigger chemical signals to mobilize the DNA repair proteins.

Within the nucleus of the cell, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones. A package of eight histones and DNA is called a nucleosome. When a DNA double-strand break occurs, histones are chemically modified at different positions. The authors studied the modification that occurs when a molecule called ubiquitin attaches to a histone in response to the DNA break. They examined the attachment of ubiquitin on the H2A histone at two positions, and, when the call goes out, how the damage response protein attaches to the nucleosome.

“By deriving a detailed 3-D structure of [the damage response protein] RNF169 bound to the ubiquitylated nucleosome we explain how specificity is achieved in ubiquitin recognition,” says Dr. Mer.

Many important regulatory interactions in the cell rely on recognition of ubiquitin-modified proteins. Structural studies like this one help define how ubiquitin is selectively recognized, as can be seen in the above image.

In this study, published in Molecular Cell, the authors also report that when RNF169, the DNA damage repair protein, binds to the nucleosome, it prevents another DNA repair protein from associating with the nucleosome. That other repair protein, 53BP1, shuts down an alternate pathway to repair DNA double-strand breaks. The authors note that inhibiting this inhibitor could, in principle, be exploited to reactivate this alternate DNA double-strand break pathway in cases where it is defective as in some forms of breast and ovarian cancer.

In addition to Dr. Mer, other authors ─ all from Mayo Clinic ─ are:

183,"Findings suggest drugs targeting immune cells may help treat deadly disease mainly affecting children.

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found evidence that specific immune cells may play a key role in the devastating effects of cerebral malaria, a severe form of malaria that mainly affects young children. The results, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, suggest that drugs targeting T cells may be effective in treating the disease. The study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Program.

“This is the first study showing that T cells target blood vessels in brains of children with cerebral malaria,” said Dorian McGavern, Ph.D., chief of the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section at the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) who co-directed the study with Susan Pierce, Ph.D., chief of the Laboratory of Immunogenetics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “These findings build a bridge between mouse and human cerebral malaria studies by implicating T cells in the development of disease pathology in children. It is well established that T cells cause the brain vasculature injury associated with cerebral malaria in mice, but this was not known in humans.”

More than 200 million people worldwide are infected annually with mosquito-borne parasites that cause malaria. In a subset of those patients, mainly young children, the parasites accumulate in brain blood vessels causing cerebral malaria, which leads to increased brain pressure from swelling. Even with available treatment, cerebral malaria still kills up to 25% of those affected resulting in nearly 400,000 deaths annually. Children who survive the infection will often have long-lasting neurological problems such as cognitive impairment.

The researchers, led by Drs. Pierce and McGavern, examined brain tissue from 23 children who died of cerebral malaria and 11 children who died from other causes. The scientists used state-of-the-art microscopy to explore the presence of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) in the brain tissue samples. CTLs are a type of T cell in our immune system that is responsible for controlling infections throughout the body.

Current treatment strategies for cerebral malaria focus on red blood cells, which are thought to clog blood vessels and create potentially fatal blockages leading to extreme pressure in the brain. However, findings in the mouse model demonstrated that CTLs damage blood vessels, leading to brain swelling and death. The role of CTLs in cerebral malaria in children hasn’t been thoroughly investigated prior to this study.

The results of the current study demonstrate an increased accumulation of CTLs along the walls of brain blood vessel in the cerebral malaria tissue samples compared to non-cerebral malaria cases. In addition, the CTLs were shown to contain and release effector molecules, which damage cells, suggesting that CTLs play a critical role in cerebral malaria by damaging the walls of brain blood vessels.

“The disease appears to be an immunological accident in which the CTLs are trying to control a parasitic infection but end up injuring brain blood vessels in the process,” said Dr. McGavern.

“In separate studies we discovered that treatment of mice with a drug that targets T cells rescued over 60% of otherwise fatal cases of experimental cerebral malaria,” said Dr. Pierce. “Given our findings of T cells in the brain vasculature of children who died of the disease, we are excited by the possibility that this drug may be the first therapy for cerebral malaria.”

The impact of HIV coinfection on the risk of developing cerebral malaria is not known. The NIH researchers compared CTL patterns in the cerebral malaria cases that were co-infected with HIV and those that were HIV negative. In the HIV-negative cases, the CTLs were seen lining up against the inside wall of brain blood vessels. In the HIV-positive cases, the CTLs had migrated across the surface to the outside of the vessels. There were also significantly more CTLs present in the HIV-positive cases.

Together these findings suggest that CTLs may play an important role in cerebral malaria and that HIV infection may worsen the disease.

Additional research is needed to uncover the role of T cells in human cerebral malaria. Future studies will also investigate how targeting T cells may help treat the disease. Plans for a clinical trial are underway to test the effects of a specific T cell blocker in cerebral malaria patients in Malawi.

The latest research, 'DNA deposited in whole thumbprints' (just published in Forensic Science International: Genetics), further studies inter-variation of DNA shedding obtained from experiments on samples gathered from 10 different people and 30 of their thumbprints.

""The first challenge at a scene is finding touch DNA, which is why we have developed an accurate special aerosol fluorescent dye 'marker',"" says Professor Adrian Linacre, who leads Flinders University's forensic DNA technology research group.

""A further challenge is evaluating the value of the evidence, and that's where shedders are a factor.

""Data like this new study allows a growing understanding of differences in DNA 'shedding' between people, and why we might find traces of people's DNA a long time after an event.""

Flinders University PhD candidate Todd Kaesler says: ""We have found that some people have higher intra-variability, indicating that these individuals will not always reliably pass on similar amounts of cellular material and DNA. This is individual-dependent.

""Any new data on cell deposition goes to strengthen our understanding of how cells are deposited and why some are found well after a criminal event.""

The study used a nucleic acid binding dye that shows the number of cells deposited when a person touches an object.

""Our work leads to more reliable touch DNA collection methods, which can be key in forensic casework,"" says Professor Linacre.

""We look forward to producing more accurate methods and informative research to help forensic scientists to fulfill their roles in a challenging environment.""",0

188,"May 2, 2023 – Your kidneys may be hailing the ""COVID-19 diet.""

Some patients prone to lowered the amount of sodium and calcium they consumed in 2020 as they switched to home cooking during the pandemic lockdowns, and the reductions have persisted even as restaurants have reopened.

Researchers from the Department of Urology at Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, NY, reported the findings recently at the 2023 meeting of the American Urology Association.

""Subjectively, we noticed our friends, families and our patients reporting that they starting cooking more at home and started eating less out at restaurants; one patient called it the 'COVID-19 diet,' "" said David Schulsinger, MD, an associate professor of urology at Stony Brook and the senior author of the study.

Restaurants were closed in New York state starting in March 2020.

Schulsinger said reducing the intake of sodium can lower the risk for hypernatriuria or hypercalciuria (too much sodium or calcium in the urine, respectively), thus lowering the risk for kidney stones, because home cooking allows patients greater control over how they season their food.",0
189,"Study findings can immediately be applied to human patients with the disease.

Researchers have discovered that a hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), is extremely elevated in mice with liver disease that mimics the same condition in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a serious genomic disorder. Based on this finding, medical teams treating patients with MMA will be able to measure FGF21 levels to predict how severely patients’ livers are affected and when to refer patients for liver transplants. The findings also might shed light on more common disorders such as fatty liver disease, obesity and diabetes by uncovering similarities in how MMA and these disorders affect energy metabolism and, more specifically, the function of mitochondria, the cells’ energy powerhouses. The study, conducted by researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health, was published Dec. 6 in JCI Insight.

“Findings from mouse studies usually take years to translate into health care treatment, but not in this case,” said Charles P. Venditti, M.D., Ph.D., senior author and senior investigator in the NHGRI Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch. “We can use this information today to ensure that patients with MMA are treated before they develop severe complications.”

MMA is a genomic disease that impairs a person’s ability to break down food proteins and certain fatty acids. The condition affects roughly 1 in 50,000 children born in the United States and can be detected through newborn screening. Children with MMA suffer from frequent life-threatening metabolic crises when they encounter a minor viral illness or other stressors like trauma, dietary imbalance or surgery. They must adhere to a special low-protein diet and take various supplements their entire lives.

The NHGRI team created a new mouse model and used it to discover key pathways that were affected during a fasting challenge to model a metabolic crisis in a patient with MMA. It enabled them to identify markers that they could then measure in MMA patients to assess the severity of the dysfunction in their mitochondria, specifically in the liver.

The MMA mice also allowed them to study the response to liver-directed gene therapy and to compare the findings in patients after liver transplant surgery. Liver transplants give patients with MMA a missing enzyme and ease some of the symptoms, but do not cure the disease. Kidney transplantation, on the other hand, is necessary when these patients reach terminal stages of renal failure, an expected chronic complication of MMA. Selecting which patients would benefit from a liver or combined liver/kidney transplant as opposed to just a kidney transplant is an important clinical decision for families and their clinicians.

“We found that having MMA, whether in a mouse or person, causes stress pathways to be chronically activated and can impair their ability to respond to acute stress,” said Irini Manoli, M.D., Ph.D., lead author and associate investigator in NHGRI’s Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch. “Our new markers can accurately predict how effective a therapy, whether cellular or genomic, might be for the patients.”

The NHGRI team will use FGF21 measurements along with other tests presented in the study in the design of upcoming gene-based clinical trials that the lab has worked on for many years. The NHGRI team will next assess the role of FGF21 pathways in other symptoms seen in MMA. Since 2003, Dr. Venditti and his team have conducted research on patients with MMA and are following 200 patients with MMA, the world’s largest cohort. Their goals are to understand what defines the vulnerability to stress in MMA to better diagnose life-threatening metabolic crises that occur in patients, test new genomic therapies and find treatments that work for every patient.

190,"Infant temperament predicts personality more than 20 years later

Behavioral inhibition in infancy associated with introversion and internalizing psychopathology in adulthood.

Researchers investigating how temperament shapes adult life-course outcomes have found that behavioral inhibition in infancy predicts a reserved, introverted personality at age 26. For those individuals who show sensitivity to making errors in adolescence, the findings indicated a higher risk for internalizing disorders (such as anxiety and depression) in adulthood. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides robust evidence of the impact of infant temperament on adult outcomes.

“While many studies link early childhood behavior to risk for psychopathology, the findings in our study are unique,” said Daniel Pine, M.D., a study author and chief of the NIMH Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience. “This is because our study assessed temperament very early in life, linking it with outcomes occurring more than 20 years later through individual differences in neural processes.”

Temperament refers to biologically based individual differences in the way people emotionally and behaviorally respond to the world. During infancy, temperament serves as the foundation of later personality. One specific type of temperament, called behavioral inhibition (BI), is characterized by cautious, fearful, and avoidant behavior toward unfamiliar people, objects, and situations. BI has been found to be relatively stable across toddlerhood and childhood, and children with BI have been found to be at greater risk for developing social withdrawal and anxiety disorders than children without BI.

Although these findings hint at the long-term outcomes of inhibited childhood temperament, only two studies to date have followed inhibited children from early childhood to adulthood. The current study, conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park, the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and the National Institute of Mental Health, recruited their participant sample at 4 months of age and characterized them for BI at 14 months (almost two years earlier than the previously published longitudinal studies). In addition, unlike the two previously published studies, the researchers included a neurophysiological measure to try to identify individual differences in risk for later psychopathology.

The researchers assessed the infants for BI at 14 months of age. At age 15, these participants returned to the lab to provide neurophysiological data. These neurophysiological measures were used to assess error-related negativity (ERN), which is a negative dip in the electrical signal recorded from the brain that occurs following incorrect responses on computerized tasks. Error-related negativity reflects the degree to which people are sensitive to errors. A larger error-related negativity signal has been associated with internalizing conditions such as anxiety, and a smaller error-related negativity has been associated with externalizing conditions such as impulsivity and substance use. The participants returned at age 26 for assessments of psychopathology, personality, social functioning, and education and employment outcomes.

“It is amazing that we have been able to keep in touch with this group of people over so many years. First their parents, and now they, continue to be interested and involved in the work,” said study author Nathan Fox, Ph.D., of the University of Maryland Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.

The researchers found that BI at 14 months of age predicted, at age 26, a more reserved personality, fewer romantic relationships in the past 10 years, and lower social functioning with friends and family. BI at 14 months also predicted higher levels of internalizing psychopathology in adulthood, but only for those who also displayed larger error-related negativity signals at age 15. BI was not associated with externalizing general psychopathology or with education and employment outcomes.

This study highlights the enduring nature of early temperament on adult outcomes and suggests that neurophysiological markers such as error-related negativity may help identify individuals most at risk for developing internalizing psychopathology in adulthood.

“We have studied the biology of behavioral inhibition over time and it is clear that it has a profound effect influencing developmental outcome,” concluded Dr. Fox.

Although this study replicates and extends past research in this area, future work with larger and more diverse samples are needed to understand the generalizability of these findings.

As of August, 86% of children between 6 months and 17 years have had at least one COVID-19 infection, which is up from 75% in April.

“What we have to recognize is this is more of an indication that there’s been broad spread of this virus in the pediatric community,” John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital, told ABC News.

“And that, you know, the kids are not sheltered from this virus,” he said. “And we know that in a small number of cases, there’s severe impacts.”

The latest data doesn’t mean that these children and teens are protected against COVID-19 reinfections, ABC News reported. Public health researchers haven’t been able to pinpoint how long the protection lasts after a previous infection.

“What we should not take away from this data is that the kids are now immune from infection, so we can’t make the leap that continual investment in vaccines and protections of our kids is not important,” Brownstein said. “As we know, immunity wanes and variants evolve to evade prior immunity.”",0
201,"Intakes of dietary or supplemental antioxidants were not associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer among men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, according to a study in the February 15 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . The study did find that vitamin E and beta-carotene supplementation may be associated with reduced prostate cancer risk in certain population subgroups.

Research suggests that micronutrients such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and carotenoids may play a role in preventing cancer development because of their ability to combat free radicals, agents that can damage cellular DNA, lipid membranes, and proteins. In many studies, vitamin E has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, and beta-carotene has been associated with increased lung cancer risk in previous studies. However, no studies have examined associations between intakes of these three antioxidant micronutrients and the risk of prostate cancer.

Richard B. Hayes, Ph.D., at the National Cancer Institute, and colleagues assessed the risk of prostate cancer for 29,361 men ages 55 to 74 enrolled in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, based on their daily intake of beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C. The researchers looked at intake of antioxidants from both dietary sources and from supplements.

The authors found that, overall, dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene was not associated with prostate cancer incidence in this group of PLCO trial participants. However, certain micronutrients were associated with prostate cancer risk in specific subgroups of men. For current or recent smokers, high-dose, long-duration vitamin E supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer. For men with a low dietary intake of beta-carotene, high-dose supplements of beta-carotene were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

""Our cohort findings, although based on relatively short follow-up, do not provide strong support for population-wide implementation of high-dose antioxidant supplementation for the prevention of prostate cancer,"" the authors write. ""They do suggest, however, that in certain population subgroups there was an association between supplement intake and reduced risks of prostate cancer.""

In an accompanying editorial, I-Min Lee, Sc.D., of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Mass., and colleagues discuss the implications of Hayes and colleagues' study in the context of earlier studies of vitamin E supplementation and cancer risk. The editorialists agree that the study results do not provide strong support for the implementation of antioxidant supplementation for the prevention of prostate cancer. They note that the data remain unclear about the benefits of vitamin E supplementation for prostate cancer prevention in the general population; however, there are strong data supporting smoking cessation to reduce cancer incidence. The authors write, ""Now and in the future, regardless of the eventual findings on vitamin E supplementation and prostate cancer risk, an important course of action for overall cancer prevention is to continue efforts to prevent the initiation of smoking and to promote the cessation of smoking among those who do smoke.""

'Lower blood pressure to the brain can cause dizziness or even a blackout (not death).'This is known as ""orthostatic hypotension,"" he added, and in such cases people should be careful about how they get out of bed. 'Initially sitting then rising may be important,' he said.
There's also a condition called micturition syncope, said Dr. Hashim Hashim, a urological surgeon and professor at Bristol Urological Institute. If someone gets out of bed quickly to use the bathroom, their blood pressure could drop causing something called 'postural hypotension,' he explained. Someone could faint due to that sudden drop in blood pressure and, 'obviously, if they faint and fall and hit their head on something hard they could sustain a head injury and die,' he said. But he doesn't know of a direct link between the condition and death absent a secondary injury.
And, of course, deaths during the night do happen ⁠-- and for many reasons, Gharib said, including due to drug overdoses. One of the most common causes is known as 'sudden cardiac death.' This is often due to an underlying coronary heart disease that may have been unrecognized, Gharib said. There's also some evidence that untreated sleep apnea may increase the risk of sudden death, possibly as a trigger for an abnormal heart rhythm. Please share the correct information .

Residents of high-level counties should wear a well-fitted mask in public indoor spaces and consider avoiding non-essential indoor activities where they could be exposed, regardless of vaccination status, the CDC says.

Medium level status means residents should wear a mask if they’re immunocompromised or at high risk for severe illness. Residents in low level counties should wear a mask based on personal preference.

209,"Sept. 28, 2022 -- Some people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine have reported a temporary change in their menstrual cycles, according to a new study published in BMJ Medicine. Vaccinated people had an adjusted increase in menstrual cycle length of less than 1 day with both the first and second vaccine doses. The increase wasn’t associated with a change in the number of days of menses, or bleeding. The changes appeared to be similar regardless of the type of COVID-19 vaccine. “These findings provide additional information for counseling women on what to expect after vaccination,” Diana Bianchi, MD, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said in a statement. “Changes following vaccination appear to be small, within the normal range of variation, and temporary,” she said. Bianchi wasn’t involved with the study. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Research on Women’s Health funded the study, which was part of a $1.67 million award given to five institutions to research the potential links between COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual changes. Researchers at universities in Oregon, Massachusetts, London, and Edinburgh looked at data for international users of Natural Cycles, a menstrual cycle tracking app, between October 2020 and November 2021. (The users had the option to consent to the use of their de-identified data for research.) The research team looked at information from nearly 20,000 people between ages 18 to 45 in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Europe, representing more than 250,000 cycles. They included data for at least three cycles before and one cycle after the vaccine among the nearly 15,000 vaccinated people and at least four cycles during a similar time period in the nearly 5,000 unvaccinated people. About 80% of the participants were under age 35. Two-thirds received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 17% received the Moderna vaccine, 9% received the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and 2% received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Overall, vaccinated people had a 0.71 day increase in their cycles after the first dose and a 0.56 day increase after the second dose. Those who received two doses in one cycle had an increase of 3.7 days, though there wasn’t an increase in the days of bleeding.

The changes were temporary. In the cycle after vaccination, the cycle length was similar to before the vaccine among those who had one vaccine dose in a cycle, with a 0.02 day increase. For those who had two doses in one cycle, their next cycle still had a 0.85 day increase. There was also a significant increase in the number of people who had a more than an 8-day increase in their cycle length, the researchers found. About 1,342 participants -- 6.2% of the vaccinated people and 5% of the unvaccinated people -- reported an increase of more than 8 days. Those who were younger and who had a longer cycle length before vaccination were more likely to report the increase. “A change in cycle length of less than eight days is considered within the normal range of variation,” the NIH said. “Although small menstrual changes may not be meaningful to health care professionals and researchers, perceived changes in a bodily function linked to fertility may be alarming to those experiencing it and could contribute to vaccine hesitancy.” The researchers noted several limitations, including that people using hormonal birth control weren’t participants since the app focuses on natural cycles. The researchers also were limited in the number of post-vaccine cycles they could calculate during that time and weren’t able to account for the effect of potential COVID-19 infection, which could also lengthen cycles. The study findings match up with a previous study published by the same group of researchers in January, which focused on women in the U.S. and found the average menstrual cycle length increased by about a day after vaccination. The researchers called for future studies on other aspects of vaccination-linked changes to menstrual cycles, such as unexpected bleeding, menstrual flow, and pain. They also noted the importance of determining the physical reasons why these changes might occur. “Our research was not designed to determine why these changes might happen,” the researchers wrote. “These changes are probably due to temporary vaccine-related activation of immune response but more research is needed.”",0
210,"Over 50 per cent of Asians living in the UK are severely deficient in vitamin D, leaving them more vulnerable to respiratory infections such as COVID-19 and musculoskeletal disorders, according to a large-scale population study published this week.

The journal Clinical Nutrition also reports that more than a third of Black Africans living in Britain have high levels of vitamin D deficiency, and lower socio-economic groups are more at risk.

Led by the Australian Centre for Precision Health, University of South Australia, using data from 440,581 UK Biobank participants, the study strengthens calls for a mandatory vitamin D fortification program in the United Kingdom.

Unlike most other high latitude western countries, the UK does not fortify any staple food items with vitamin D, aside from a small amount added to margarine.

The hormone is naturally synthesised in the body through sun exposure, but long winter months and less time spent outdoors have contributed to alarmingly high vitamin D deficiency in pockets of the UK, with overall levels falling below the most conservative global recommendations.

First author, UniSA PhD student Joshua Sutherland, says the findings show that certain ethnic and socio-economic groups, as well as those living in the northern areas of the UK, are far more likely to be vitamin D deficient.

""The reason that people with darker skin are more at risk is because higher levels of melanin, which increases skin pigmentation, can lessen the skin's ability to make vitamin D,"" Sutherland says. ""But this, combined with spending more time indoors and consuming lower vitamin D-containing foods, can foster severe deficiency.""

""Of almost half a million people surveyed, we found that 57 per cent of Asians were severely deficient in vitamin D (levels below 25 nmol/L) in winter/spring and 50.8 per cent in summer and autumn.

""Black Africans were the next most vulnerable (38.5 per cent deficient in winter and 30.8 per cent in summer), followed by mixed race people and Chinese participants. White Europeans had the lowest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency but many are still affected.""

Vitamin D is a hormone that controls calcium levels in the blood and helps build strong bones, regulates immune and muscle function and contributes to overall health.

Regular consumption of oily fish has a protective effect, but Asians are less likely to eat fish or use vitamin D supplements compared to other ethnicities, the researchers found.

There was a clear seasonal contrast in vitamin D levels among white Europeans, with 17.5 per cent showing a deficiency in winter, compared to 5.9 per cent in summer. The seasonal variations were not as marked in other cultural groups.

Time spent outdoors, and high levels of TV and computer use were all strongly associated with a greater chance of vitamin D deficiency in white Europeans, but this association was much weaker for other ethnicities.

Nearly one third of study participants living in Edinburgh and Glasgow recorded low vitamin D levels in winter, while southern UK residents, from comparatively higher socio-economic regions, had less winter deficiency and were also more likely to take vitamin D supplements and eat more oily fish.

""These findings highlight the continuing need for effective health interventions to reduce the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the UK, both at the population level and within at-risk groups,"" Sutherland says.

""Fortification of a single food item, such as the proposed wheat fortification program, is tricky because some South Asian groups are more likely to eat millet and rice than wheat. It's clear the UK requires targeted public health measures to mitigate deficiency risk in all affected populations,"" he says.

The study was led by Professor Elina Hypponen, who is one of the world leading experts on vitamin D.

""The rate of severe deficiency was much higher in most population groups than we would have expected, so these results are really very alarming,"" says Prof Hypponen.

""The severity of vitamin D deficiency is concerning, especially with the high rates of COVID-19 infections in Europe and elsewhere in the northern hemisphere this winter. Clinical trials have shown that vitamin D supplements are beneficial in the prevention of respiratory infections and even mortality.

In a large study of vaccinated and unvaccinated adults ages 65 and older, those who received at least one influenza vaccine were less likely than unvaccinated peers to get Alzheimer’s over the course of 4 years.

But it’s not a one and done. The strength of the protective effect increased with the number of years that a person received an annual flu shot, such that the rate of developing Alzheimer’s was lowest in people who consistently got the flu vaccine every year.

""Influenza infection can cause serious health complications, particularly in adults 65 and older,"" says Avram Bukhbinder, MD, with UTHealth in Houston.

""Our study's findings – that vaccination against the flu virus may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer's dementia for at least a few years – adds to the already compelling reasons to talk with your doctor about getting the flu vaccine annually,"" he says.",0
212,"Around 1% of the world's population lives with epilepsy; yet only 65% of epilepsy patients can manage their symptoms with medication. Currently, surgically removing the lesion in the brain responsible for the condition is the only radical cure for epilepsy. Still, many patients have to take medication for the rest of their life to deal with their seizures.

A research group led by professor Ko Matsui from the Super-network Brain Physiology Lab at Tohoku University reported on a stimulation paradigm used on experimental animals that could potentially cultivate resilience to epilepsy.

Frequent seizure-evoking stimulation to the brain has been shown to induce epileptogenesis and epileptic brain conditions. To the researcher's surprise, however, repeated stimulation resulted in a dramatic decrease in the seizure response to the stimulus.

""Our brain has an infinite ability for plasticity,"" says Matsui. ""If an epileptic state can be created, we must query whether it is also conceivable to reverse the transition or to override the existing hyper-excitable circuit with an additional suppressive system.""

Using optogenetics technology to control the activity, Dr. Yoshiteru Shimoda, Matsui and their team demonstrated that a specific stimulation paradigm prompted the release of the endogenous inhibitory transmitter adenosine from glial cells. This converted the rat's brain to a state strongly resistant to seizures.

Details of their findings were published in Neurobiology of Disease online.

Matsui is cautiously optimistic. ""Although epileptogenesis unfortunately could not be reversed, we showed we could invoke the homeostatic nature of the brain circuit to contain hyper-excitation.""

For the current study, light-sensitive proteins were genetically expressed in neurons to regulate moderate neuron-to-glial signaling at will. Such optogenetic technology would be difficult to apply in human patients, noted Matsui.

""Despite clinical use being a long way off, it is possible to imagine a future where a therapeutic strategy can directly target glial cells and enable the creation of an epileptic resistant state.""",0
213,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — A dissolvable plug delivered stem cell therapy with few side effects in patients with single tract perianal fistulas, Mayo Clinic researchers discovered. Perianal fistulas are painful tunnels between the intestine and the skin that often do not go away with standard medical or surgical care. People with Crohn's disease or other inflammatory bowel conditions are most at risk for this condition.

In a prospective, phase 1 clinical trial, researchers loaded stem cells from a patient's own fat tissue onto a bioabsorbable plug that was then surgically implanted to close the anal fistula tract. They followed the patients for one year and reported results of their early research in Diseases of the Colon & Rectum.

""In this early study, our team documented healing of single-tract fistulas,"" says Eric Dozois, M.D., a colorectal surgeon and first author on the study. ""In my 20 years of clinical experience, our fistula research suggests we are getting closer to a care model.""

As many as 26% of people with Crohn's disease will develop perianal fistulas. Most often, it starts with an infection within the anal gland and often progresses into an abscess that sometimes requires surgery. Left untreated, perianal fistulas leak fecal material and can lead to permanent colostomy and, in some cases, cancer. A colostomy is a surgical opening in the abdomen that bypasses the damaged colon to rid the body of solid waste. Perianal fistulas can cause quality-of-life challenges, such as the need to wear pads to protect clothing and prevent odor.

""Perianal fistulas are a complex medical condition that, even when repaired surgically, can reoccur, causing a lot of suffering for patients,"" says William Faubion Jr., M.D., a gastroenterologist and senior author on the study. ""Our hope with this research is to advance a cell-based therapy toward daily clinical care that would be easy to implant in the operating room and offer a new option for patients with unmet needs.""

The research team extracted mesenchymal stem cells from adipose (fat) tissue of 20 patients with perianal fistulas who had not responded to standard medical or surgical treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells are adult stem cells with healing potential that have been well studied. After multiplying the stem cells in the lab, the team combined the cells with a plug created from a dissolvable material. They surgically implanted the plug to close the anal fistula tract then monitored the patients seven times within 12 months, with a focus on investigating safety. They also studied whether the treatment intervention led to clinical healing that could be confirmed through deep tissue imaging.

Dr. Dozois' team documented complete healing of 14 patients at six months and 13 patients at one year. Three patients withdrew for various reasons during the course of the clinical trial.

Four participants reported side effects such as infections that required admission to the hospital or surgical draining of an abscess. Twelve participants experienced reactions considered to be minor, such as redness, fever or nausea.

Based on their findings, Dr. Dozois' team is recommending further study of the stem cell-coated fistula plug with larger sample sizes and more types of fistulas. If all goes well, it could take two or three years before this procedure is approved for routine clinical care.

Dr. Dozois, Dr. Faubion and Mayo Clinic have financial interests in the regenerative fistula plug technology. Any profits Mayo Clinic realizes from its business ventures are reinvested in research and education initiatives at Mayo.

214,"Trinity College Dublin researchers collaborating with University College London have demonstrated for the first time the low environmental footprint of water fluoridation compared to other preventive measures for tooth decay. The study is published in the British Dental Journal today [Monday 29th August 2022].

Water fluoridation is regarded as one of the most significant public health interventions of the twentieth century. But as the climate crisis worsens, the contribution of healthcare and the prevention of disease to the crisis must be considered. Action is urgent.

Influenced by this urgency, researchers quantified the environmental impact of water fluoridation for an individual five year-old child over a one-year period and compared this to the traditional use of fluoride varnish and toothbrushing programmes, which take place in selected schools across the UK, and internationally.

Today, over 35% of the world's population have access to water fluoridation, with studies showing significant reductions in dental caries. Whilst data on the clinical effectiveness and cost analysis of water fluoridation are available, there has been no data regarding its environmental impact up to now.

To quantify this impact, the research team performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) by carefully measuring the combined travel, the weight and amounts of all products and the processes involved in all three preventive programmes (toothbrushing, fluoride varnish programmes and water fluoridation). Data was inputted into a specific environmental programme (OpenLCA) and the team used the Ecoinvent database, enabling them to calculate environmental outputs, including the carbon footprint, the amount of water used for each product and the amount of land use.

The results of the study, led by Brett Duane, Associate Professor in Dental Public Health at Trinity College, concluded that water fluoridation had the lowest environmental impact in all categories studied, and had the lowest disability-adjusted life years impact when compared to all other community-level caries prevention programmes. The study also found that water fluoridation gives the greatest return on investment.

Considering the balance between clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and environmental sustainability, researchers believe that water fluoridation should be the preventive intervention of choice.

This research strengthens the case internationally for water fluoridation programmes to reduce dental decay, especially in the most vulnerable populations.

Associate Professor Duane said: ""As the climate crisis starts to worsen, we need to find ways of preventing disease to reduce the environmental impact of our health systems. This research clearly demonstrates the low carbon impact of water fluoridation as an effective prevention tool.""

Professor Paul Ashley, Senior Clinical Lecturer (Honorary NHS Consultant), UCL Eastman Dental Institute added: ""Renewed efforts should be made to increase access to this intervention.""",0

219,"Cunlin Wang, M.D., Ph.D., of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Md., and colleagues studied recipients of intravenous (IV) iron (n = 688,183) enrolled in the fee-for-service Medicare program from January 2003 to December 2013. The study appears in the November 17 issue of JAMA.

In 2010, anemia affected one third of the global population, and iron deficiency was the most common cause. Oral iron replacement is the primary treatment strategy for iron deficiency anemia but may be inadequate for some patients due to intolerance, impaired absorption, significant ongoing bleeding, or nonadherence. For these patients, intravenous iron may be indicated. As of June 2013, there were 5 IV iron products marketed in the United States. While their efficacy is established, the most important safety concern relates to the risk of serious and fatal anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction to a substance), which may occur at both first and subsequent exposures. The comparative safety of each product has not been well established, according to background information in the article.

This study examined administrations of IV iron dextran, gluconate, sucrose, or ferumoxytol. A total of 274 anaphylaxis cases were identified at first exposure, with an additional 170 cases identified during subsequent IV iron administrations. The researchers found that iron dextran was associated with increased anaphylaxis risk compared with nondextran formulations at first administration. Among the nondextran products, the risk of anaphylaxis at first administration was higher with both iron gluconate and ferumoxytol than with iron sucrose.

Because each IV iron product has a specific recommended dose and schedule of administration, the cumulative risk of anaphylaxis was also calculated based on both the number of administrations and clinically relevant repletion level of iron (1000 mg) achieved within 12 weeks. Both analyses showed iron dextran was associated with the highest cumulative risk of anaphylaxis and iron sucrose with the lowest risk.

The authors note that the mechanism of anaphylactic reaction after IV iron remains unknown.",0
220,"Dec. 19, 2022 -- Alexander Truong, MD, has been seeing long COVID patients for more than 2 years but thought the numbers would have significantly dwindled by now. Instead, a steady flow of patients still shows up at the Emory Executive Park post-COVID clinic he and a colleague launched in fall 2020 in Atlanta. And among patients infected more than once, the symptoms appear worse. “We are definitely seeing a lot of patients who, when they get reinfected, have worsening post-COVID issues. That’s very true and I think that’s a big signal,” says Truong, a pulmonologist and an assistant professor at Emory University’s School of Medicine. COVID-19 is definitely not over, says Angela Cheung, MD, PhD, a senior physician scientist with the University Health Network and a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto. And each time someone gets infected, they risk developing long COVID. A prior infection does not erase the risk, Cheung says. “It’s not like, ‘Oh, I’ve had one, so it’s OK. Now I can take off my mask, do what I like.’ It has health consequences for reinfections – higher mortality rate, higher hospitalization rates, higher risk of long term, lingering symptoms,” she says. New research suggests that those infected more than once have an increased risk of developing long COVID and other health problems compared to those infected just once. But parsing out the extent of these risks – particularly with newer variants – is more complicated, Truong and other experts say, particularly when factoring in vaccinations and antiviral treatments. “It makes sense that repeat infections would not be beneficial to a person's health. But I think it's really hard to know what the additional risk of each subsequent infection would be because there are all sorts of other things in the mix,” says Michael Peluso, MD, an assistant professor of medicine and an infectious diseases doctor at the University of California San Francisco. “There are vaccines -- new vaccines, old vaccines. There are variants -- old variants, new variants, and now multiple variants circulating at the same time.”

A large study involving the records of 5.8 million Department of Veterans Affairs patients that was published in Nature Medicine in November found that patients infected more than once had significantly higher risks of death, hospitalization, heart problems, blood clotting, long COVID, and a host of other health issues and organ damage. Notably, the study found that these elevated risks remained even 6 months after reinfection. While the study highlights the increased risks associated with reinfections, it has its limitations. The study did not directly compare a first infection to reinfection within the same pool of patients. It only compared one group of individuals who had a single infection to a separate group who had more than one infection. There could be other factors that made one group more susceptible to reinfection and at greater risk of adverse health outcomes. The study also did not compare reinfection risks between different variants or subvariants. Another limitation is the VA population itself. The VA database is extremely useful for large studies like this one because it follows a large number of people with comprehensive medical records, experts say, but the VA’s population of mostly older white males does not reflect the demographics of the general population. Nonetheless, the message for the public is straightforward, says Cheung. “I wouldn’t get into the weeds. The big message and big picture is that reinfections are bad."" Different Risks With New Variants? Experts say understanding reinfection risks, particularly with the newer variants and subvariants, is complicated because more people are now vaccinated compared to earlier in the pandemic. “There are not any definitive answers. … It’s very, very difficult to disentangle the emergence of new variants from the uptake of vaccines,” says Peluso. “It does seem like overall there may be less long COVID with the newer variants, but it’s very hard to say whether that is a characteristic of the virus or a characteristic of the fact that most people who are getting the virus have either been vaccinated or previously infected to have some different immune baseline from somebody who's seeing the viral antigen for the first time.”

However, consensus is growing that those who are vaccinated and end up with breakthrough infections are at lower risk of developing long COVID. One U.K. study published in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases in September, for example, found that people who had two COVID-19 vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to infection had a 41% decrease in the odds of developing long COVID symptoms, compared to people who were not vaccinated at the time of infection. “We also know that in patients who’ve had their vaccinations, they are less likely to have a reinfection, or when they do have reinfection, they’re less likely to have severe infection,” says Truong. “That’s the one big signal that we have and that’s why I'm trying to wave the flag as much as I can about getting vaccinated [and boosted].” While some data suggests the risks of long COVID are lower with Omicron variants compared with the Delta variant, experts point out that a far greater number of people have been infected with Omicron, so even a small percentage of a large number is still a large number. “One study looking at Omicron versus Delta shows about half the risk, but half the risk in a lot more people is still a lot of high absolute numbers,” Cheung says, referring to a June paper published in The Lancet. She still sees a lot of patients with long COVID – some infected as recently as this past summer, some vaccinated and infected for the first time, and others coming in following reinfections. And while Omicron variant and subvariant infections may appear milder for many people, doctors note new patients are also showing up with the same debilitating symptoms as those who got long COVID earlier in the pandemic: fatigue, shortness of breath, racing heart, brain fog, sleep disturbances, and mental health issues. “On my post-COVID clinic days, I’m still seeing four to eight new patients who had infections in 2022 come in with significant symptoms,” says Truong. And long COVID can kill. More than 3,500 death certificates filed from the start of the pandemic through June 2022 list long COVID as a specific cause of death, the National Center for Health Statistics reports.

Peluso says what can be learned from the VA study is that repeated attacks on the immune system are dangerous and that continuing to avoid infection remains extremely important. “The best way for someone to protect themselves against that is to avoid getting COVID in the first place,” says Peluso. It is a sentiment echoed by Truong and Cheung. But given the transmissibility of the newest variants and subvariants and the removal of public health measures, it’s often difficult to prevent infection. Tried and true tools do, however, work: being up to date on vaccinations, wearing high-quality, well-fitted masks, advocating for good ventilation, and conducting self-testing with rapid antigen tests, particularly ahead of indoor events during busy holiday periods. “It’s possible that this may become less common over time. I hope that’s true,” Peluso says. “It’s also possible that it might go the other way. And so for that reason, I’m trying to avoid all of the variants.”",0

The National Republican Senatorial Committee campaign ad attacks Democratic challenger Steve Bullock on behalf of Montana Sen. Steve Daines. It takes issue with the Montana governor’s support for a public option ― generally defined as a federally administered health plan that would compete with private insurers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
It assumes the implementation of a public option for health insurance would lead to lower reimbursement rates and cause rural hospitals to close. Experts say this conclusion is difficult to draw without knowing who would be covered by the public option and how it would pay providers.
However, Bullock’s campaign said that no rural hospital in the state has closed during his tenure as governor and that he would support paying hospitals at rates higher than Medicare.
The ad also assumes the public option would lead to “Medicare for All,” an outcome on which health care scholars disagree. Medicare for All is the single-payer health system advocated by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

228,"Stay-at-home orders can reduce COVID-19 deaths, though the effectiveness of these measures can vary greatly from one location to another due to many factors. Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg/Getty Images
• A number of studies have shown that stay-at-home orders have helped slow the spread of coronavirus during the pandemic.
• However, the effectiveness can vary greatly from one area to another due to many factors such as compliance.
• Some studies have found that while local stay-at-home orders can be effective, their effectiveness diminishes over time as people begin to feel “lockdown fatigue.” A recent preprint that combines data from several other studies suggests that lockdowns early in the pandemic didn’t reduce COVID-19 deaths. However, experts say this nonpeer-reviewed paper has serious flaws that limit the conclusions being made by the authors. “This report on the effect of ‘lockdowns’ does not significantly advance our understanding of the relative effectiveness of the plethora of public health measures adopted by different countries to limit COVID-19 transmission,” Neil Ferguson, PhD, an epidemiologist and professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said in a statement.

The preprint was published on the website of the Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. All three of the paper’s authors are economists — not medical doctors, epidemiologists, or public health experts — and only one is from Johns Hopkins University. The paper is a meta-analysis, which combines the results of independent studies to get a better sense of the overall effect of an intervention such as a medication, other treatment, or a public health response. This type of analysis involves more than just combining data from separate studies. Researchers use statistical methods to merge the findings while considering differences in how those studies were carried out. In addition, a well-designed meta-analysis has to use the best statistical methods and needs to include all of the appropriate studies in the analysis. Seth Flaxman, PhD, a statistician also at Imperial College London, said in the same statement that the authors of the preprint did not do the latter. “They systematically excluded from consideration any study based on the science of disease transmission,” he said, “meaning that the only studies looked at in the analysis are studies using the methods of economics.” Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, agreed. “The included studies certainly aren’t representative of research as a whole on lockdowns — not even close,” he wrote on Twitter. “Many of the most robust papers on the impact of lockdowns are, by definition, excluded.” In addition to excluding several important studies, the authors use a definition of “lockdown” that some experts find a little too broad. “The most inconsistent aspect [of the preprint] is the reinterpreting of what a lockdown is,” Samir Bhatt, DPhil, a professor of statistics and public health at Imperial College London, said in the statement. The preprint authors define a lockdown as “the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention,” which includes stay-at-home orders as well as physical distancing, handwashing, and others. Many scientists have stopped using “lockdown” because it isn’t a policy, said Bhatt. It is an “umbrella word” for a set of policies designed to slow the community spread of the coronavirus. So a lockdown in the United States and a lockdown in the United Kingdom would look very different. In fact, a lockdown in one U.S. state would look very different from one in another state. “All of this adds up to a very weird review paper,” wrote Meyerowitz-Katz on Twitter.

Bhatt also found the preprint concerning because it focused on the early part of the pandemic, even though countries and local governments have been using nonpharmaceutical interventions — including stay-at-home orders — throughout the pandemic. “[The study] looks at a tiny slice of the pandemic,” he said. “There have been many lockdowns since globally with far better data.” Other studies — including this one and — have looked at later periods during the pandemic. These studies also found that stronger government measures reduced COVID-19 deaths more. One challenge with estimating the impact of mitigation strategies on COVID-19 deaths is that these measures are intended to slow transmission of the virus. The impact on hospitalizations and deaths comes later. “Because there’s a lag from infection to death, to see the effect of lockdowns on COVID deaths, we need to wait about two or three weeks,” said Flaxman in the statement. Ferguson said in the statement that “many studies of the effects of [nonpharmaceutical interventions] fail to recognize this important issue.” Another thing that researchers have to take into account is that stay-at-home orders are rarely imposed in isolation. They may follow — or occur at the same time as — less restrictive interventions, such as mask policies, capacity restrictions, and school closures. In an earlier , Flaxman and Bhatt wrote that it is difficult to “disentangle the individual effect sizes of each intervention” because countries implemented these in “rapid succession.” “Analysis has been further complicated by the accumulation of immunity — from infection and vaccination — in populations, together with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants,” Ferguson said in the statement. Other factors that can impact COVID-19 death rates include hospital capacity and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, all of which vary widely across countries.

Olga Yakusheva, PhD, an economist in the School of Nursing at the University of Michigan, and her colleagues took some of these issues into account during their on the benefits and costs of mitigation measures early in the pandemic in the United States. Their analysis looked at the impact of the “full set of public health measures,” said Yakusheva, which included stay-at-home orders and other measures such as mask policies, physical distancing, and school closures. However, they didn’t just focus on the impact these measures had on COVID-19 deaths. They also looked at the adverse impact of the economic downturn that occurred as a result of these measures. Similar research done before has focused on the financial impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures, but Yakusheva and her colleagues estimated the number of deaths that might occur as a result of this economic disruption. These deaths might result from the loss of a job or income that leads to diminished access to health insurance or the inability to buy essentials such as food or medication — all of which can impact a person’s health. “The impetus for this paper was to humanize the economic damage,” said Yakusheva, “so we can more effectively use the same language to talk about the costs and the benefits of the lockdown.” The researchers estimate that during the first 6 months of the pandemic, between 800,000 and 1.7 million lives were saved as a result of these health measures. “These are the people who would have potentially died from COVID had they not been protected by the strong public health response,” said Yakusheva. In contrast, they estimate that between 57,000 and 245,000 deaths potentially occurred due to the economic downturn during the first part of 2020. “When you look at it in terms of lives saved versus lives lost, it does seem that the lockdowns were more protective of human lives in comparison to the economic damage they caused,” said Yakusheva. In this study, the researchers attempt to address one of the many nuances in the debate over stay-at-home orders — how do you balance the benefits and costs of these kinds of measures? It’s never as easy as saying lockdowns are “good” or “bad.” In making public health decisions, scientists and health officials look at the entire body of research to figure out what types of mitigation strategies work best and in what circumstances. And also, how long these measures should be put in place.

Yogesh Joshi, PhD, an associate professor in the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, and his colleagues looked at the impact of stay-at-home orders on mobility. These types of mitigation strategies are intended to slow the spread of the virus by encouraging people to stay home, which reduces their interactions with others. In Joshi’s , he and his colleagues found that stay-at-home orders reduced mobility in most countries they looked at. But after a while, people began moving around more in the community, even though the stay-at-home order continued. One of their analyses showed that on average, by 7 or 8 weeks after the start of the lockdown, mobility was essentially back where it started. “When lockdowns extend for long periods of time, then the past data shows us that mobility levels start rebounding,” said Joshi. While they didn’t look specifically at the effectiveness of shorter stay-at-home orders — sometimes called “circuit breakers” — Joshi “speculates that shorter lockdowns should yield higher compliance, in terms of [people] staying at home.” Health officials can use mobility data to help make decisions about stay-at-home orders. For example, said Joshi, if people in a community have already voluntarily restricted their movement in response to the high spread of the coronavirus, imposing a stay-at-home order may not have much of an effect. Officials might also want to emphasize less restrictive mitigation measures first — such as mask policies and business capacity limits — which can be effective when put in place early during a surge. “Our research finds that lockdowns have an effect, but that effect wears out over time,” said Joshi. “Further research may be needed to investigate whether countries where lockdowns were repeatedly imposed continue to exhibit the same type of response to lockdowns each time around, or whether there is a wear-out across lockdowns as well,” he added. Yakusheva emphasized that her paper is just one of many that helps to clarify the benefits and costs of COVID-19 mitigation measures. “My paper, just as much as anybody else’s paper, is never a final answer to this question,” she said. “It’s a piece of the puzzle, and it should be taken into consideration in the context of all of the other research.”",0
229,"Research published in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery & Psychiatry shows that food allergies are linked to increased disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with allergic patients experiencing more relapses and a higher risk of nerve damage visible on MRI scans. Risk factors for MS include genetics, environmental factors, high altitude, female gender, smoking, low vitamin D levels, and Epstein Barr virus infection, while allergies to environmental triggers, drugs, and food have also been suggested as possible risk factors. To investigate further, the researchers assessed possible links between allergies and MS flare-ups and disease activity on MRI scans in 1349 patients with MS. Participants with at least one known allergy (427) were compared to those without (922), with 586 having an environmental allergy, 238 having a food allergy, and 574 being allergic to prescribed drugs. Allergy was initially associated with a higher rate of cumulative disease bouts, but this effect disappeared when influential factors were taken into account. Food allergy did not have a significant impact on disease flare-ups compared to patients with no allergies. However, any type of allergy was associated with higher odds of active disease on an MRI scan. The study has limitations as an observational study reliant on questionnaires and subjective assessments. Further research is necessary to confirm the findings. The researchers suggest that food allergies may have a greater effect on MS inflammatory activity than environmental or drug allergies.",1
230,"Oct. 18, 2022 -- Women who use chemical hair straightening products may be at an increased risk for uterine cancer, according to new research from the National Institutes of Health.

Women who use straightening products more than four times per year have the highest risk for developing uterine cancer, according to the study. More specifically, the researchers found that women who used straightening or relaxing products more than four times per year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer compared to those who don't use these products.

Lead study author Alexandra White, PhD, said that about 1.64% of women who don't use chemical hair straightening products develop uterine cancer by age 70. But for frequent users of these products, that risk goes up to 4.05%.

""This double rate is concerning,"" she said. But ""it's important to put this information into context,"" she noted, as ""uterine cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.""

Previous research has linked hair product use, such as hair dye, to increased risks of other hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer. But researchers believe this is the first analysis that examined the use of hair straighteners in relation to uterine cancer.",0
231,"Aug. 4, 2022 -- Many women seeking abortion pills online have unknowingly been ordering the pills from one of many fake clinics making false claims, pharmacy experts report. While some online sites are licensed and legitimately connect consumers with the pills, the illegal sites may sell either counterfeit or expired pills or deliver no pills and just steal payment information. Al Carter, PharmD, executive director of the nonprofit National Association of Boards of Pharmacy says that since the the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June, there has been an increase in his team’s discovery of illegal online sites selling what they claim are abortion medications. “Ninety-six percent of the online pharmacies out there are illegitimate,” he says. “They’re violating some type of state or federal law in almost every incidence.” The court ruled that individual states could ban abortion procedures. The resulting patchwork of laws and access barriers have made conditions ripe for a growing black market online for mifepristone and misoprostol, two drugs used in combination to induce abortions.

Interest in the drugs soared after the Supreme Court ruling was leaked in May. Within 3 days of the leak, online searches for abortion medications jumped 162% compared with the 3 days before the ruling, according to a report in JAMA Internal Medicine. Among red flags that an abortion-pill website is fraudulent, Carter says, are that the site doesn’t ask for a prescription for the abortion drugs. Mifepristone and misoprostol can be legally accessed only with a prescription. If there is no contact where you can speak with a pharmacist, that’s another clue, he says. Sites that make false claims about abortion pills are growing just as the illegal sites that popped up in the pandemic peddling COVID-19 “cures” and non-approved vaccines and treatments, Carter says, adding that the same fear-based tactics are being used. The NABP is trying to bring attention to illegal websites not only for abortion drugs, but pain medications and others as well with its safe pharmacy site. There you can plug in the website address in question and check its legitimacy.",0
232,"June 17, 2022 -- As the story goes, doctors in the United States quit their jobs in droves during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven to flee the profession by burnout, depression, and defiant patients. But did they really? While some surveys and news headlines have suggested an unprecedented wave of early retirements or career changes during the past 2+ years, some experts are casting doubt on that scenario. So was there a mass shuttering of medical practices during the pandemic? ""It's an excellent question, and one that I'm not satisfied on a statistical basis has actually happened,"" Gary Price, MD, the president of the Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds healthcare research and policy, says. On the surface, the reports certainly look dire. Surveys and testimonies from doctors collected since the start of the COVID-19 crisis all forecast a looming surge in resignations. In December, for example, a study published by the Mayo Clinic of 20,665 health care workers at 124 institutions found that approximately one third of doctors said they intended to reduce their working hours in the next year. One in 5 doctors said they intended to leave their current practice within the next 2 years. Those numbers are similar to an ongoing survey of primary care doctors by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University. Data from the most recent survey found that 62% of primary care doctors know of other clinicians who have retired early or quit their practices during the pandemic. Price, a 69-year-old plastic surgeon in New Haven, Connecticut, considered retiring at the start of the pandemic when elective surgeries were put on pause. He expects to retire within a year. And, like many doctors, Price knows of colleagues — including a former student — who quit medicine during the past 2 years of COVID-19. But beyond such anecdotes, determining how many doctors called it quits during the pandemic is unclear. Doctors and scientists like to say that the plural of anecdote is not evidence — but anecdotes seem to be the main support for the pandemic retirement wave. Surveys capture doctors who say they plan on retiring in the near future, but several experts said in interviews that no one is collecting hard numbers of doctors who have quit.

The data gap is particularly problematic for primary care, which represents the largest group of doctors in the US, numbering nearly 209,000. Rebecca Etz, PhD, a cultural anthropologist who co-directs Virginia Commonwealth's Green Center and leads the survey, says it is difficult to get reliable data on employment trends for primary care and medical specialties in general. ""We don't have any national database for primary care. It's a big, gaping hole for us,"" Etz says. ""Most of what we know about primary care we know by proxy. We look at surrogates that tell us what is likely to be true and we look at broader datasets."" A survey conducted by Medscape, WebMD’s sister site for health care professionals, this spring found that 18% of nearly 500 US doctors said they intended to retire within the next 12 months, while 24% said they planned to cut back on their work hours in the coming year. Retirement from practice doesn't necessarily mean a departure from medicine itself. Indeed, 43% of those in the Medscape survey who said they planned to quit also said they wanted to stay involved in the field in some capacity. Not surprisingly, most of the doctors who say they plan to leave their practices are older. Nearly 45% of doctors across all specialties are older than 55, data from a 2020 report from the Association of American Medical Colleges found, leading researchers to conclude that more than 2 out of every 5 doctors who are actively practicing will be over 65 in the next 10 years. Researchers at the University of Minnesota analyzed Medicare claims data before the pandemic began and in the months following the spread of COVID-19. Aside from a large spike in interruptions in claims during April 2020, rates of claims interruptions were pretty much the same during the pandemic as they were before COVID took hold. Doctors age 55 and up were most likely to stop filing Medicare claims, the researchers reported. Ultimately, we don't really know if more doctors quit medicine during the pandemic than in earlier years. All we have are context clues — and those even paint a confusing picture.

For Etz and many other experts who study the pitfalls of the health care industry, doctors may be seeking retirement because of how the pandemic has chipped away at the patient–doctor relationship. ""What keeps [doctors] going is their connection with their patients. When that's destroyed or damaged, that's when they lose their resilience and they can't sustain their practice,"" Etz says. For Price, the patient–doctor relationship was further injured by many patients' attitudes towards COVID-19, and the skepticism they brought into doctors' offices. ""The pandemic added a dimension we've never seen before as physicians and that was the dimension of patients refusing to help us make things better,"" Price said. ""We found a big part of the population refusing to do something as simple as wear a mask or get vaccinated. And I think that was a feeling that physicians have never had before that they weren't working with the community to help everyone get better."" Much of the talk of early retirement may be a cry for help — or wishful thinking — from doctors who have spent years losing touch with patient care, says Denise Brown, MD, the chief strategy officer for Vituity , a national doctor staffing firm. According to Brown, doctors generally don't feel like their work is that rewarding anymore. The burdens of electronic health records, working as an employee, fighting with insurance companies, and other factors have weakened many doctors' emotional connection with patients and their profession. And then the pandemic hit. When pondering their futures, ""Some [doctors] just make it a knee-jerk reaction and say, ‘I'm going to retire,' "" Brown added. Ironically, Brown said, doctors may feel like victims but a sizable share of their problems today are of their own making. ""In the early 2000s especially, a lot of physicians relinquished their license to act. They threw up their hands and said, 'I guess I work for Blue Cross now.' Very few people were like, 'No, I'm not going to do that.' So some of what we're seeing today is the fruit of the poison tree,"" Brown explained. ""Now is the time for physicians to take the reins back, to bring a little more sensibility to what we do.""",0

240,"Oct. 9, 2022 -- The breast cancer death rate in the U.S. dropped by 43% during the past three decades, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths, according to a new study from the American Cancer Society.

At the same time, Black women continue to be more likely to die from breast cancer even though they have a lower incidence of the disease.

“Death rates are declining in Black women, just like they are in almost every other group, but we’re still seeing the same gap,” Rebecca Siegel, the senior study author and the senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, told CNN.

“The evidence is consistent that Black women receive short shrift in the health care system at every point of the breast cancer care continuum, from lower-quality mammography to delays between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of treatment to poor quality treatment when they are diagnosed,” she said. “The take-home message is that we really need to take a hard look at how we’re treating Black women differently.”",0
241,"An experimental single-dose, intranasal influenza vaccine called Ad4-H5-VTN was found to be safe and produce a durable immune response in a Phase 1 study. The vaccine was administered intranasally, orally, and via tonsillar swab to healthy adults between the ages of 18-49. Participants who received the vaccine intranasally or via tonsillar swab showed significantly higher H5-specific neutralizing antibody levels compared to the group receiving the vaccine capsule orally. The duration of viral shedding correlated with a high magnitude of neutralizing antibody response at week 26, and the vaccine induced a mucosal immune response critical for limiting viral transmission. The authors speculate that this vaccine platform could be adaptable for use against other viruses, including HIV and SARS-CoV-2.

The study examined data from 14 adults with quadriparesis from spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, or ALS who were enrolled in the trial from 2004 to 2021. With the use of Utah microelectrode arrays, the average duration of device implantation was 872 days, yielding a total of 12,203 days for safety analyses, and there were 68 device-related adverse events, including 6 device-related serious adverse events. Importantly, there were no safety events that required device removal, no infections of the brain or nervous system, and no adverse events resulting in permanently increased disability related to the investigational device.

246,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― Olanzapine, a generic drug used to treat nervous, emotional and mental conditions, also may help patients with advanced cancer successfully manage nausea and vomiting unrelated to chemotherapy. These are the findings of a study published Thursday, May 7 in JAMA Oncology.

Charles Loprinzi, M.D., a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist, played a leadership role in this work in conjunction with Rudolph Navari, M.D., of The University of Alabama at Birmingham.

""It's well-appreciated by most people that patients receiving cancer chemotherapy suffer from nausea and vomiting,"" explains Dr. Loprinzi. ""However, it's less well-appreciated that patients with advanced cancer also have significant problems with nausea and vomiting that are unrelated to chemotherapy.""

Drs. Loprinzi and Navari found limited research regarding nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer unrelated to chemotherapy, so they decided to conduct a clinical trial.

The colleagues, along with other collaborators, conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 30 patients with advanced cancer who had not recently received chemotherapy or radiation therapy but did have substantial trouble with nausea and vomiting. Researchers randomly assigned patients to receive a low-dose of olanzapine or a placebo daily. Neither the trial participants nor their clinicians knew whether participants were receiving olanzapine or a placebo.

Prior to starting their medications on the first day of the study, participants rated their nausea over the previous 24 hours on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being none and 10 being as bad as it could be. Participants continued to rate their nausea every day at about the same time of day for the duration of the study.

When the study was unblinded, the research team learned that all 30 participants recorded nausea scores of 8-10 on the first day of the study. After one day and one week, nausea scores in the 15 patients who received a placebo were all still 8–10 out of 10. In contrast, the 15 patients who received olanzapine had scores of 2–3 out of 10 after one day and 0–3 out of 10 after one week. Correspondingly, these patients reported less vomiting, better appetite and better well-being. No patient-reported adverse events were observed among trial participants receiving olanzapine.

""Olanzapine given at 5 milligrams per day for seven days markedly improved patient quality of life with no side effects,"" says Dr. Navari. ""And as a generic drug, it's also relatively affordable, with a one-month supply often costing anywhere from $10 to $15.""

""Current guidelines for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer have not specifically indicated that one drug looks substantially better than a variety of other drugs,"" says Dr. Loprinzi. ""However, we believe the present results may be viewed as a best practice for treating nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer-associated nausea and vomiting.""

247,"It may start with a simple word you can't pronounce. Your tongue and lips stumble, and gibberish comes out.

Misspeaking might draw a chuckle from family and friends. But, then, it keeps happening. Progressively, more and more speech is lost. Some patients eventually become mute from primary progressive apraxia of speech, a disorder related to degenerative neurologic disease.

Two Mayo Clinic researchers have spent more than a decade uncovering clues to apraxia of speech. Keith Josephs, M.D., a neurologist, and Joseph R. Duffy, Ph.D., a speech pathologist, will present ""My Words Come Out Wrong: When Thought and Language Are Disconnected from Speech"" on Sunday, Feb. 14, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

Because patients and even many medical professionals don't recognize apraxia of speech, treatment typically is sought in later stages of the disease, says Dr. Josephs. As apraxia progresses, it frequently is misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One patient received vocal cord injections of Botox by a physician who thought the issue was muscle spasms of the larynx. Apraxia of speech even has been diagnosed as mental illness.

""Because it first presents as 'just' a speech problem, some people are told, 'This is in your head.' We've seen that. It's very sad,"" Dr. Josephs says.

When it's caused by a stroke, apraxia of speech typically does not worsen and may get better over time. But, apraxia of speech often is ignored as a distinct entity that can evolve into a neurologic disorder, causing difficulty with eye movement, using the limbs, walking and falling that worsens as time passes.

""I don't want the take-home message to be that this condition is benign,"" warns Dr. Josephs. ""It is a devastating disease, in some sense worse than Alzheimer's disease, which typically spares balance and walking until very late in the disease course. It may start with the person simply not being able to pronounce a few words. Six years after that, they are in a diaper, can't speak, can't walk and are drooling.""

The benefit to getting an early and correct diagnosis is that people can receive appropriate therapy. ""It would be good if people recognized that changes in speech can be the first signs of neurologic disease,"" Dr. Duffy says. ""An important part of treatment is providing information about the condition.""

While speech therapy doesn't reverse or halt the progression of apraxia, it can develop compensations for producing better sounds. People with apraxia of speech also can use computers or texting for alternate means of communicating.

Both the value and complexities of speech often are underappreciated. ""Speech is what connects us to the world,"" Dr. Duffy says.

Speech is a complex brain-body achievement, these researchers note. It first requires selection of appropriate words, organizing them into a coherent message. This message activates 100 muscles between the lungs and lips to produce at least 14 distinct sounds per second that can be comprehended by a listener. A problem with speech programming -- directing the muscles and structures that move -- is apraxia.

People with apraxia of speech or their loved ones may notice:
• Inconsistent mistakes, such as saying a word or sound correctly sometimes and not others
• Groping of the mouth to make sounds
• Better automatic speech, such as greetings, compared with purposeful speech

Apraxia of speech differs from aphasia, a language disorder that interferes with a patient's ability to understand or use words. Patients, however, can have apraxia of speech and aphasia.

While the cause of primary progressive apraxia of speech has not been determined, an abnormal accumulation of tau protein -- a factor also contributing to Alzheimer's disease -- has been found in the brains of those with apraxia of speech who have died.

Mayo Clinic has received National Institutes of Health grants, for which Dr. Josephs is the primary investigator, to focus on apraxia of speech in the context of neurodegenerative cognitive and motor disorders.

Drs. Josephs, Duffy and fellow researchers have published articles about their findings in Brain, the American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Other Dementias, Neurology and the Journal of Neurology.",0

249,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0

251,"Findings provide insight that may inform search for treatments.

Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have discovered a second gene that causes melorheostosis, a rare group of conditions involving an often painful and disfiguring overgrowth of bone tissue. The gene, SMAD3, is part of a pathway that regulates cell development and growth. The researchers are now working to develop an animal model with a mutant version of SMAD3 to test potential treatments for the condition. The study appears in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

Melorheostosis affects about 1 in 1 million people. Its causes have long been unknown. DNA tests of blood and skin could not identify a mutation. The key to finding the gene was to biopsy the affected bone directly and compare it to unaffected bone. Earlier, the researchers used this method to discover the gene for “dripping candle wax bone disease,” a form of melorheostosis in which excess bone growth appears to drip from the bone surface like hot wax. In that study, mutations in the gene MAP2K1 accounted for eight cases of the disease among 15 patients.

In the current study, researchers scanned the exome — the part of the genome that codes for proteins — and found mutations in the affected bone. These mutations occurred during the patient’s lifetime rather than being inherited from parents and are not present in all the cells of the body.

The researchers found SMAD3 mutations in four of the patients who did not have mutations in MAP2K1. SMAD3 is involved in a pathway crucial for skeletal development both before and after birth. The SMAD3 mutations increase the maturation of bone-forming cells and are involved in a cellular pathway distinct from the MAPK2K1 pathway.

Immunotherapy does not focus on breakthroughs for treating solid tumors and requires specific interactions between T cells and APCs. Tumor vaccines do not rely on random interactions with APCs and immune checkpoint-based immunotherapy has limited success. However, a team of scientists have formulated a novel vaccine that showed high efficacy in treating solid tumors and induces long-lasting immune memory. The vaccine's dendritic cell membrane greatly improves immune activation and its anti-tumor capabilities are not facilitated by unexposed or exhausted T cells. The team has no plans to apply this platform technology in other diseases and does not intend to establish a standard operating procedure for scaling vaccine synthesis.

253,"June 22, 2022 – Moderna released study results today showing its new Omicron-specific booster increased antibodies against the coronavirus by a factor of 5, even against some of the newer and more worrisome variants.

The company also today said it will soon ask the FDA to authorize the use of the vaccine. The company said shipments of this vaccine could begin as early as this summer.

The booster in development contains both Moderna’s original COVID-19 vaccine and one specifically designed to target the more recent BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants.

The announcement comes at a time when the proportion of BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in the United States is growing. These two strains now account for about 35% of those circulating in the U.S., according to CDC data.

BA.4 and BA.5 ""represent an emergent threat to global public health,"" Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, stated in a news release. ""We will submit these data to regulators urgently and are preparing to supply our next generation bivalent booster starting in August, ahead of a potential rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections due to Omicron subvariants in the early fall.""",0
254,"March 1, 2023 – Eli Lilly will cut prices for most of its insulins in the United States by 70% and cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month, the company announced on Wednesday. “Lilly is taking these actions to make it easier to access Lilly insulin and help Americans who may have difficulty navigating a complex healthcare system that may keep them from getting affordable insulin,” the company said in a statement. The $35 price cap is effective immediately, at participating retail pharmacies for people with commercial insurance. Those without insurance can go to InsulinAffordability.com and download the Lilly Insulin Value Program savings card to receive Lilly insulins for $35 per month. The company says it will cut the list price of its non-branded Insulin Lispro Injection 100 units/mL to $25 a vial, effective May 1. The list price of the branded Humalog (insulin lispro injection) 100 units/mL will be cut by 70%, effective in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Lilly is among the three main companies that make insulin, along with Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, who have come under fire for the cost of it in the U.S., with studies showing that up to 25% of people with type 1 diabetes ration insulin due to costs, putting their health and often their lives in jeopardy. Prices in the U.S. are around 10 times higher than in other countries. California is the latest state to say it plans to sue these big three companies over the high price of insulin, and has announced plans to make its own cheaper versions. Many people on Twitter praised the news, using the hashtag ""#insulin4all"" in their posts. The hashtag #insulin4all is a worldwide campaign to ensure people with type 1 diabetes have access to affordable insulin and other supplies needed to manage the condition, such as glucose strips. It is supported, among others, by the T1International advocacy group, which has a U.S.-specific website. Some patients with type 2 diabetes are also insulin-dependent. Asked at a telephone news briefing if the California lawsuit prompted the company’s move, Lilly Chair and CEO David A. Ricks said, ""Of course there are complaints against the industry and the company. We see those as completely unfounded. However, we can probably all agree that patients should have a consistent and lower-cost experience at the pharmacy counter, and that’s what today’s announcement is about. We’re doing this completely voluntarily because it’s time and it’s the right thing to do.”",0
255,"Drawn to the allure of multivitamins and dietary supplements filling nutritional gaps in their diet, people in the U.S. in 2021 spent close to $50 billion on vitamins and dietary supplements.

But Northwestern Medicine scientists say for non-pregnant, otherwise healthy Americans, vitamins are a waste of money because there isn't enough evidence they help prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer.

""Patients ask all the time, 'What supplements should I be taking?' They're wasting money and focus thinking there has to be a magic set of pills that will keep them healthy when we should all be following the evidence-based practices of eating healthy and exercising,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Linder, chief of general internal medicine in the department of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Linder and fellow Northwestern Medicine scientists wrote an editorial that will be published June 21 in JAMA that supports new recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an independent panel of national experts that frequently makes evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services.

Based on a systematic review of 84 studies, the USPSTF's new guidelines state there was ""insufficient evidence"" that taking multivitamins, paired supplements or single supplements can help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer in otherwise healthy, non-pregnant adults.

""The task force is not saying 'don't take multivitamins,' but there's this idea that if these were really good for you, we'd know by now,"" Linder said.

The task force is specifically recommending against taking beta-carotene supplements because of a possible increased risk of lung cancer, and is recommending against taking vitamin E supplements because it has no net benefit in reducing mortality, cardiovascular disease or cancer.

""The harm is that talking with patients about supplements during the very limited time we get to see them, we're missing out on counseling about how to really reduce cardiovascular risks, like through exercise or smoking cessation,"" Linder said.

More than half of Americans take vitamins. Why?

More than half of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, and use of supplements is projected to increase, Linder and his colleagues wrote in the JAMA editorial.

Eating fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased cardiovascular disease and cancer risk, they said, so it is reasonable to think key vitamins and minerals could be extracted from fruits and vegetables, packaged into a pill, and save people the trouble and expense of maintaining a balanced diet. But, they explain, whole fruits and vegetables contain a mixture of vitamins, phytochemicals, fiber and other nutrients that probably act synergistically to deliver health benefits. Micronutrients in isolation may act differently in the body than when naturally packaged with a host of other dietary components.

Linder noted individuals who have a vitamin deficiency can still benefit from taking dietary supplements, such as calcium and vitamin D, which have been shown to prevent fractures and maybe falls in older adults.

New guidelines do not apply to pregnant people

The new USPSTF guidelines do not apply to people who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, said JAMA editorial co-author Dr. Natalie Cameron, an instructor of general internal medicine at Feinberg.

""Pregnant individuals should keep in mind that these guidelines don't apply to them,"" said Cameron, who also is a Northwestern Medicine physician. ""Certain vitamins, such as folic acid, are essential for pregnant women to support healthy fetal development. The most common way to meet these needs is to take a prenatal vitamin. More data is needed to understand how specific vitamin supplementation may modify risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular complications during pregnancy.""

Additionally, recent research from Northwestern has found most women in the U.S. have poor heart health prior to becoming pregnant. Cameron said that, in addition to discussing vitamin supplementation, working with patients to optimize cardiovascular health prior to pregnancy is an important component of prenatal care.

Eating healthy, exercising is 'easier said than done'

Dr. Jenny Jia, a co-author of the JAMA editorial who studies the prevention of chronic diseases in low-income families through lifestyle interventions, said healthy eating can be a challenge when the U.S. industrialized food system does not prioritize health.

""To adopt a healthy diet and exercise more, that's easier said than done, especially among lower-income Americans,"" said Jia, an instructor of general internal medicine at Feinberg and a Northwestern Medicine physician. ""Healthy food is expensive, and people don't always have the means to find environments to exercise -- maybe it's unsafe outdoors or they can't afford a facility. So, what can we do to try to make it easier and help support healthier decisions?""

Over the past few years, Jia has been working with charitable food pantries and banks that supply free groceries to people who are in need to try to help clients pick healthier choices from the food pantries as well as educate those who donate to provide healthier options or money.",0

The study, co-led by Oliver J. Watson, PhD, and Gregory Barnsley, MSc, with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Imperial College London in London, England, was published online Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

Researchers estimated that vaccines prevented 14.4 million deaths from COVID in the countries and territories between December 8, 2020, and December 8, 2021.

But the estimate rose to 19.8 million deaths from COVID averted when excess deaths were added to the equation.

264,"In asthma, the airways become hyperresponsive. Researchers from Uppsala University have found a new mechanism that contributes to, and explains, airway hyperresponsiveness. The results are published in the scientific journal Allergy.

Some 10 per cent of Sweden's population suffer from asthma. In asthmatics, the airways are hyperresponsive (overreactive) to various types of stimuli, such as cold air, physical exertion and chemicals. The airways become constricted, making breathing difficult.

To diagnose asthma, a ""methacholine test"" is commonly used to determine whether a person is showing signs of airway hyperresponsiveness. Methacholine binds to what are known as muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle cells lining the inside of the trachea. These muscle cells then begin to contract, causing constriction of the trachea.

In the new study, the scientists show that the airway hyperresponsiveness induced by methacholine is due partly to the body's mast cells. The research was conducted using a mouse model of asthma, where the mice were made allergic to house dust mites.

Mast cells, which are immune cells of a specific type belonging to the innate immune system, are found mainly in tissues that are in contact with the external environment, such as the airways and the skin. Because of their location and the fact that they have numerous different receptors capable of recognising parts of foreign or pathogenic substances, they react quickly and become activated. In their cytoplasm, mast cells have storage capsules, known as granules, in which some substances are stored in their active form. When the mast cell is activated, these substances can be rapidly released and provoke a physiological reaction. This plays a major part in the body's defence against pathogens, but in asthma and other diseases where the body starts reacting against harmless substances in the environment, it becomes a problem.

In their study, the researchers were able to demonstrate that the mast cells contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness by having a receptor that recognises methacholine: muscarinic receptor-3 (M3). When methacholine binds M3, the mast cells release serotonin. This then acts on nerve cells, which in turn control the airways. Thereafter, the airways produce acetylcholine, which also acts on M3 in smooth muscle cells and makes the trachea contract even more. A vicious cycle is under way.

The scientists' discovery also means that drugs like tiotropium, which were previously thought to work solely by blocking M3 in smooth muscle, are probably also efficacious because they prevent activation through M3 in mast cells. Accordingly, the ability of mast cells to rapidly release serotonin in response to various stimuli, thereby contributing to airway hyperresponsiveness, has been underestimated.",0

Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. More than 390 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through September 27, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 8,164 reports of death (0.0021%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it's unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event--blood clots with low platelets--which has caused deaths

270,"Any diet will do? Not if you want to lose fat instead of muscle. Not if you want to lower your triglyceride levels so you'll be less likely to develop diabetes and heart disease. Not if you want to avoid cravings that tempt you to cheat on your diet. And not if you want to keep the weight off long-term.

""Our latest study shows you have a better chance of achieving all these goals if you follow a diet that is moderately high in protein,"" said Donald Layman, a University of Illinois professor emeritus of nutrition. The research was published in the March Journal of Nutrition.

Layman's new study followed the weight-loss efforts of 130 persons at two sites, the U of I and Penn State University, during 4 months of active weight loss and 8 months of maintenance.

Two previous studies had looked at short-term weight loss; this one was designed to look at long-term effects, he said.

Although both plans were equal in calories, half the group followed a moderate-protein diet (40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, 30% fat) while the other followed a diet based on USDA's food-guide pyramid (55% carbohydrates, 15% protein, 15% fat).

""Persons in the first group ate twice the amount of protein as the second group,"" said Layman.

And the difference in protein made all the difference in improved body composition and body lipids, he said.

Although the amount of weight lost in both groups was similar, at 4 months participants in the protein group had lost 22 percent more body fat than members of the food-pyramid group. At 12 months, the moderate-protein dieters had lost 38 percent more body fat.

""The additional protein helped dieters preserve muscle. That's important for long-term weight loss because muscle burns calories—if you lose muscle, and you used to be able to consume 2,000 calories without gaining weight, you'll find that now you can only eat, say, 1,800 calories without weight gain,"" he said.

What were the effects on lipids? Although at 4 months the food-guide pyramid appeared to be more effective in lowering LDL and total cholesterol levels, at 12 months LDL levels came back up until both diets were equally effective, Layman said.

""This is the first study to show that short-term changes in LDL cholesterol are not maintained with long-term weight loss. Most scientists believe that high cholesterol is more a factor of genetics than of diet,"" he said.

But the moderate-protein diet had by far the bigger effect on lowering triglycerides, and that lasted as long as individuals remained on the diet, he said.

""Of the two types of lipid problems, high triglycerides pose a greater risk for heart disease. Approximately twice as many people have high triglycerides, and people with this condition are approximately four times more likely to die from heart disease,"" the scientist said.

To ensure compliance, participants met every week for weigh-ins and nutrition instruction. ""We taught participants how to follow their diet, how to grocery shop, and how to prepare the meals. They also measured everything they ate three days a week,"" he said.

""Studies that report there is no difference among diets also report that subjects were not carefully following the diets,"" said Layman. ""It's very important to realize the difference between diet compliance and diet effectiveness.""

The protein diet was easier to follow and maintain long-term, with 64 percent of the moderate-protein dieters completing the study compared to 45 percent of dieters using the high-carbohydrate diet, Layman said.

""Subjects on the moderate-protein diet reported that they weren't as interested in snacks or desserts, and they didn't have food cravings. When you eat protein, you feel full longer,"" he said.

Average weight loss for the protein group was 23 percent higher than the food-pyramid group, with 31 percent of ""completers"" in the protein group losing more of than 10 percent of their initial body weight versus 21 percent of the food-pyramid group.

273,"A new National Institutes of Health grant merges two ongoing frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) studies to form a new, integrated consortium. FTLD is a rare disease that can affect parts of the brain responsible for personality, behavior, language, and motor function. The funding, from NIH’s National Institute on Aging (NIA) and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), is expected to total more than $63 million over five years to advance the development of treatments for FTLD.

The existing NIH-supported studies — Advancing Research and Treatment in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ARTFL) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial Frontotemporal Dementia Subjects (LEFFTDS) — together form the new ARTFL–LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) research consortium. The overarching goal for the consortium is to prepare for clinical trials by helping researchers better understand the FTLD disease process by finding improved methods for accurately identifying participants with FTLD and for measuring disease progression. Specifically, the consortium aims to find the best biomarkers, such as MRI neuroimaging, to track disease burden and develop ways to calculate, and predict risk of worsening symptoms.

“This unified approach is another example of collaborative NIH efforts meant to speed up discovery in a very challenging research area and make measurable progress against a devastating group of diseases,” said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D. “The discoveries made in FTLD could also help with finding treatments for other dementias, such as Alzheimer’s disease.”

While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common dementia, scientists think FTLD is the most common cause of dementia in people younger than age 60. Roughly 60% of people with FTLD are 45 to 64 years old, and people as young as in their 30s can be affected. There are no current treatments for FTLD, which is the neuropathological definition for frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

FTLD is associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and shares some characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease, including misfolded proteins and loss of brain cells. However, the diseases that make up FTLD are distinct. For example, while Alzheimer’s is primarily associated with amyloid and tau proteins, FTLD can be caused by another form of tau or the protein TDP43. While Alzheimer’s is characterized by problems in memory, the range of symptoms of FTLD can include unusual behaviors, emotional problems, trouble communicating, difficulty with work or difficulty with walking.

“We are deeply aware of the large burden of these brain diseases on people as well as their families and caregivers, and recognize the urgent need for therapies,” said NINDS Director Walter Koroshetz, M.D. “Key to this research is measuring and understanding how FTLD progresses so we can slow or stop it.”

Now combined within the ALLFTD consortium, the LEFFTDS study enrolls and follows individuals from families with a known genetic mutation causing FTD, and the ARTFL study focuses on those without known mutations, although some have strong family histories without one of the known FTD mutations.

Led by researchers at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and the University of California, San Francisco, ALLFTD is a single infrastructure using the same clinical data platform with collaborative decision-making among 18 sites:
• Columbia University in the City of New York
• The University of Alabama at Birmingham
• The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

The ALLFTD consortium has seven research cores designed to improve the capacity for data collection and sharing. Clinical and neuropsychological measures will be submitted to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and biospecimen samples will be stored at the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias at Indiana University in Indianapolis. Brain imaging data will be stored at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

274,"Nitrites and nitrates occur naturally in water and soil and are commonly ingested from drinking water and dietary sources. They are also used as food additives to increase shelf life. A study publishing January 17 in the open access journal PLOS Medicine by Bernard Srour of the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN-CRESS) of Inserm, INRAE, Cnam, and Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Bobigny, France and colleagues suggests an association between dietary exposure to nitrites and risk of type 2 diabetes.

Some public health authorities have advocated for limiting the use of nitrites and nitrates as food additives. However, the role of dietary nitrites and nitrates in metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes in humans remains unexplored. In order to investigate the relationship between dietary exposure to nitrites/nitrates type 2 diabetes risk, researchers accessed data collected from 104,168 participants in the prospective cohort NutriNet-Santé. The NutriNet-Santé study is an ongoing, web-based cohort study initiated in 2009. Participants aged fifteen and older enroll voluntarily and self-report medical history, sociodemographic, diet, lifestyle, and major health updates. The researchers used detailed nitrite/nitrate exposure, derived from several databases and sources, and then developed statistical models to analyze self-reported diet information with health outcomes.

The researchers found that participants in the NutriNet-Santé cohort reporting a higher intake of nitrites overall and specifically from food additives, and non-additives sources had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There was no association between nitrates and type 2 diabetes risk, and the findings did not support any potential benefits for dietary nitrites or nitrates in terms of protection against type 2 diabetes. The study had several limitations and additional research is required to validate the results. The data were self-reported and the researchers could not confirm specific nitrite/nitrate exposure using biomarkers due to the underlying biological challenges. Additionally, people in the cohort's demographics and behaviors may not be generalizable to the rest of the population -- the cohort included a greater number of younger individuals, more often women, who exhibited healthier behaviors. Residual confounding may also have impacted the outcomes as a result of the observational design of the study.

According to the authors, ""These results provide a new piece of evidence in the context of current discussions regarding the need for a reduction of nitrite additives' use in processed meats by the food industry, and could support the need for better regulation of soil contamination by fertilizers. In the meantime, several public health authorities worldwide already recommend citizens to limit their consumption of foods containing controversial additives, including sodium nitrite.""

Srour and Touvier add, ""This is the first largescale cohort study to suggest a direct association between additives-originated nitrites and type-2 diabetes risk. It also corroborates previously suggested associations between total dietary nitrites and T2D risk.""",0
275,"Six-year vitamin E supplementation decreased mortality by 41% in elderly male smokers who had high dietary vitamin C intake, but increased mortality by 19% in middle-aged smokers who had high vitamin C intake, according to a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Large-scale controlled trials have not found any overall effects of vitamin E supplementation on the mortality of participants. Nevertheless, the effect of vitamin E on respiratory infections has significantly diverged between different population groups suggesting that the effects of vitamin E may not be uniform over all the population.

Dr. Harri Hemila, and Professor Jaakko Kaprio, of the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied whether the effect of vitamin E supplementation on mortality might diverge between different population groups. They analyzed the data of the large randomized trial (Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study) which was conducted in Finland between 1985-1993 and included male smokers aged 50-69 years. There were 3571 deaths in 29,133 participants during the 6-year supplementation of 50 mg/day of vitamin E.

Although vitamin E had no overall effect on mortality, its effect was modified by age and dietary vitamin C intake. Vitamin E had no effect on participants who had low dietary vitamin C intake, less than 90 mg/day. However, in those who had high vitamin C intake, over 90 mg/day, the effect of vitamin E diverged so that it increased mortality in young participants (50-62 years), but decreased mortality in old participants (66-69 years).

The US nutritional recommendations, issued by the prestigious Institute of Medicine, consider that vitamin E is safe in doses up to 1000 mg/day. This new study gives further evidence indicating that in some population groups vitamin E may be harmful in a substantially lower dose, 50 mg/day.

The researchers concluded that ""in people younger than 65 years, taking vitamin E supplements should be strongly discouraged, until clear evidence emerges that some population groups of younger or middle-aged people benefit"". They also concluded that the effect of vitamin E on elderly people should be further investigated.",0

277,"Cerebral organoid model provides clues about how to prevent virus-induced brain cell death

Scientists have determined that La Crosse virus, which can cause inflammation of the brain in children, affects brain cells differently depending on their developmental stage.

Scientists have determined that La Crosse virus (LACV), which can cause inflammation of the brain in children, affects brain cells differently depending on their developmental stage. Neurons—the primary brain cells of the central nervous system—evolve from neural stem cells and during development “commit” to becoming neurons. A new National Institutes of Health study shows that uncommitted neural stems cells generally survive LACV infection, while LACV often kills neurons. The study also shows that neurons infected by LACV can be rescued by interferon, a powerful antiviral protein. The study results appear in the Journal of Neuroinflammation.

LACV is spread by mosquitoes and was first identified in the early 1960s. Most infections in people are mild but the virus sometimes—particularly in children—enters the brain, infects neurons and causes disease ranging from learning and memory difficulties to paralysis, seizures and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receives reports of an average of 68 LACV encephalitis cases each year in the United States, nearly all east of the Mississippi River.

The NIH scientists, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, used cerebral organoids to model how LACV infects the human brain. Cerebral organoids are small spheres of human brain cells ranging in size from that of a poppy seed to a small pea. Importantly, cerebral organoids contain different neuronal cell types, which allowed the investigators to assess the sensitivity of neural stem cells and neurons to LACV infection.

After infecting cerebral organoids with LACV, the researchers observed that the virus was more likely to kill neurons, and they also found that the immune response to the virus was weaker in those cells than in neural stem cells. The largest observed difference was in genes activated by interferon, which are important in protecting cells from viruses.

The investigators then repeated the experiment, but this time treated the cerebral organoids with interferon 24 hours after infecting them. The therapy successfully protected neurons from virus-induced death. The scientists plan to continue developing their cerebral organoid model and studying the feasibility of using interferon to treat LACV infection and other viral diseases of the brain.

279,"Aug. 16, 2022 – Women who have high blood pressure while pregnant are more likely to get dementia later in life, new research hints.

High blood pressure disorders of pregnancy affect nearly 1 in 7 women in the United States. They are one of the leading causes of illness and death in mothers and babies.

These disorders include gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. These pregnancy complications have been strongly linked to heart disease in later life, but, until now, few studies have connected these disorders with thinking and memory.

Researchers looked back at the records of more than 59,000 women who gave birth in Utah over 80 years.

Compared with women with no history of a high blood pressure disorder of pregnancy, women with preeclampsia had a 1.38 times higher risk of dementia overall, and a 1.58 times higher risk of “vascular” dementia – a decline in thinking skills caused by conditions that block or reduce blood flow to the brain.

Also, women with a history of gestational hypertension had a 1.36 times higher risk of dementia overall and 2.75 times higher risk of vascular dementia.

Karen Schliep, PhD, with University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City, presented the findings at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.

The Utah findings are in line with a recent study from Denmark.

In that study, pregnant women who got preeclampsia had more than three times the risk of getting dementia later in life than women who did not have the pregnancy complication.

Considering the serious short- and long-term effects of these pregnancy complications, “early detection and treatment are vital to protect both the pregnant person and baby,” Claire Sexton, PhD, senior director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association, said in a news release.

""These data illuminate the importance of prenatal care and monitoring the long-term health of pregnant people. Those who experience any changes with their memory and cognition should have a discussion with their health care provider,” she said.",0
280,"Just one year after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a global pandemic, three COVID-19 vaccines are available in the United States, and more than 2 million Americans are receiving shots each day. Americans are eager to get back to business as usual, but experts caution that opening the economy prematurely could allow a potential resurgence of the virus. How foot traffic patterns in restaurants and bars, schools and universities, nail salons and barbershops affect the risk of transmission has been largely unknown.

In an article published in npj Digital Medicine, researcher-physicians from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) used anonymized cell-phone data to build a Business Risk Index, which quantifies the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in these establishments. The team's index accounts for both the density of visits and the length of time individuals linger inside, providing a more precise description of the human interactions -- and thus risk of viral transmission -- going on inside.

""While business traffic pre-pandemic and during statewide shut downs has been studied, business foot traffic and its relationship to COVID-19 transmission in the so-called 'new normal' of re-opening has not been well understood."" said corresponding author Ashley O'Donoghue, PhD, Economist, in the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at BIDMC. ""Many forecasting models use anonymized cell-phone mobility data as a broad measure of the movement of residents. But two regions with same levels of mobility will likely see very different levels of COVID-19 transmission if people in one region are diligently practicing social distancing and people in the other are not.""

O'Donoghue and colleagues built their risk index by analyzing trends in foot traffic patterns in more than 1.25 million businesses across eight states from January to June 2020. In the six New England states, New York and California, the team saw a 30 percent drop in high-density foot traffic and long visit lengths to businesses -- two factors that can increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission -- from the pre-pandemic baseline to April 2020. They saw similar declines when they looked at similar risky foot traffic patterns in restaurants, bars, universities and personal care establishments (which includes hair and nail salons and barbershops). In both analyses, the risk index rose steadily starting in mid-June as states eased restrictions.

Next, using county-level COVID-19 data for the same time period, the team demonstrated that their index could accurately forecast future COVID-19 cases with a one-week lag. The team found that an increase in a county's average Business Risk Index was associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people in one week.

""Not all types of mobility contribute equally to increased risk of transmission, so it is important to directly measure human interaction when weighing the costs and benefits of reopening and lifting restrictions on businesses,"" said senior author Jennifer P. Stevens, MD, MS, Director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at BIDMC. ""Tracking how individuals use different businesses may provide the kind of information policymakers need to re-open different businesses in the safest way possible.""

O'Donoghue, Stevens and team are now building an online decision-support tool that will help policymakers and hospital decision-makers monitor weekly risk in their areas. They have also deployed a prototype of their tool for Massachusetts that is being used by a large tertiary academic medical center in Boston to monitor potential surges in their service area, and their index has been integrated as a feature in a forecasting model for a large health system in Massachusetts.

""Our index can better quantify close human interactions, which are important predictors of transmission and help identify potential disease surges,"" said Stevens.

282,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a progressive disorder that devastates motor nerve cells. People diagnosed with ALS slowly lose the ability to control muscle movement, and are ultimately unable to speak, eat, move, or breathe. The cellular mechanisms behind ALS are also found in certain types of dementia.

A groundbreaking scientific study published in Nature Medicine has found one way an RNA binding protein may contribute to ALS disease progression. Cells make RNA to carry instructions for making proteins from DNA to protein-constructing machinery.

The culprit protein, TDP-43, normally binds to small pieces of newly read RNA and helps shuttle the fragments around inside nerve cell nuclei. The study describes for the first time the molecular consequences of misplaced TDP-43 inside nerve cells, and demonstrates that correcting its location can restore nerve cell function. Misplacement of TDP-43 in nerve cells is a hallmark of ALS and other neurological disorders including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Studies that characterize common mechanisms behind these diseases could have widespread implications and may also accelerate development of broad-based therapies.

To find the misplaced TDP-43, the researchers viewed nerve cells donated by people who died from ALS or FTD under high powered microscopes. They discovered TDP-43 accumulates in nerve cell mitochondria, critical structures responsible for generating the enormous amount of energy nerve cells require. By physically isolating the affected mitochondria the researchers were able to pinpoint TDP-43's exact location inside the subcellular structures. They were also able to characterize variations of the protein most likely to get misplaced.

This important work was led by Xinglong Wang, PhD, from the department of pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and a team of scientists from his laboratory.

""By multiple approaches, we have identified the mitochondrial inner membrane facing matrix as the major site for mitochondrial TDP-43,"" explained Wang. ""Mitochondria might be major accumulation sites of TDP-43 in dying neurons in various major neurodegenerative diseases.""

The researchers discovered that once inside the mitochondria, TDP-43 resumes its RNA binding role and attaches itself to mitochondrial genetic material. This disrupts the mitochondria's ability to generate energy for the cell. Wang's team was able to precisely identify the RNA in mitochondria that was bound by TDP-43 and observe the resultant disassembly of mitochondrial protein complexes. This finding provides much needed clarity on the consequences of TDP-43 misplacement inside nerve cells and opens the door for deeper studies involving a range of neurological disorders. Although the study focused on ALS and FTD, according to Wang ""mislocalization of TDP-43 represents a key pathological feature correlating strongly with symptoms in more than half of Alzheimer's disease patients.""

Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and FTD. Wang's team found that disease-associated mutations in TDP-43 enhance its misplacement inside nerve cells. The researchers also identified sections of TDP-43 that are recognized by mitochondria and serve as signals to let it inside. These sections could serve as therapeutic targets, as the study found blocking them prevents TDP-43 from localizing inside mitochondria. Importantly, Wang's team was able to keep TDP-43 out of nerve cell mitochondria in mice using small proteins which ""almost completely"" prevented nerve cell toxicity and disease progression.

""We, for the first time, provide the novel concept that the inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization is sufficient to prevent TDP-43-linked neurodegeneration,"" said Wang. ""Targeting mitochondrial TDP-43 could be a novel therapeutic approach for ALS, FTD and other TDP-43-linked neurodegenerative diseases.""

Wang has begun to develop small proteins that prevent TDP-43 from reaching mitochondria in human nerve cells, and has a patent pending for the therapeutic molecule used in the study.

There is no treatment currently available for ALS or FTD. The average life expectancy for people newly diagnosed with ALS is just three years, according to The ALS Association.",0
283,"In a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, virologists from the University of Pittsburgh Center for Vaccine Research reverse-engineered an elusive virus linked to chronic kidney disease in cats and described its mechanism of infection, outlining its potential to infect people.

The research suggested that the feline morbillivirus, or FeMV, uses the same mechanism of cell entry and infection as other viruses in the morbillivirus family, such as measles. However, unlike measles, FeMV appears to spread from host to host through urine in a similar way to the zoonotic Nipah virus harbored in bats, which causes annual deadly outbreaks in humans across Southeast Asia.

The study provides the first clear insight into this understudied virus and its potential trajectory from infecting animals to jumping into humans.

""Feline morbillivirus stayed under the radar for many years,"" said senior author Paul Duprex, Ph.D., director of the Center for Vaccine Research at Pitt's School of Medicine. ""By understanding the genetics of a virus that was challenging to grow in the laboratory, we are now able to shine light on its connection to chronic kidney disease and better understand how we can stop transmission and potential spillover into human populations.""

First discovered in stray cats in Hong Kong a decade ago, FeMV has since been found in domestic cats across Asia and Europe and identified and fully sequenced in the U.S. in 2016 by Duprex's research team when they worked in Boston. While previous studies have linked FeMV infections to chronic kidney disease in cats -- one of the leading causes of death in older animals -- the new study shows in unprecedented detail how the virus gets to the kidneys.

Similar to other members of the same viral family, FeMV enters cells by binding to a surface protein receptor called CD150. Related viruses, including measles, use CD150 as their primary entry receptor, and people who are vaccinated against measles are protected from getting infected with FeMV. The eradication of measles, however, might present an evolutionary opportunity for other morbilliviruses, such as FeMV, to seek new hosts and jump into unvaccinated people.

""That's why illuminating animal diseases proactively matters,"" said Duprex. ""Preparedness is vital in heading off an epidemic.""

By creating a genetically modified version of FeMV containing a fluorescent probe, researchers were able to track its spread throughout cells and organs, discovering that its transmission can be halted by inhibiting a class of protein-cleaving enzymes called cathepsins. Interestingly, cathepsins are mostly used by Nipah viruses but not the morbilliviruses, suggesting that FeMV is an evolutionary intermediate between the two viral families.

""It's important to understand the pathogens of animals because those can become the pathogens of people,"" said Duprex. ""Learning about the viruses that infect cats is not only important for reducing the rates of kidney failure in our beloved pets, but also helps us understand something new about emerging infectious diseases and how they can spread across different animal species. There are about 85 million cats in the U.S. and over half a billion in the world. We live with them in close proximity, and their health matters.""

286,"For the longest time, clinicians have treated cardiovascular disease by focusing on diabetes and blood pressure control, reducing cholesterol using medications like aspirin and statins.

Despite these measures, heart disease remains the number one cause of death in the United States, with many patients having heart attacks even after their risk factors are controlled, says Salim Hayek, M.D., physician-scientist and medical director of the University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Clinics.

But a study led by Michigan Medicine has uncovered a protein produced by the immune system that causes atherosclerosis -- the hardening of arteries that affects over a billion people worldwide -- which offers the promise of new treatments.

""Targeting the immune component central to the development of atherosclerosis is the Holy Grail for the treatment of heart disease,"" said Hayek, senior author of the study ""This is the first time that a component of the immune system is identified that meets all the requirements for being a promising treatment target for atherosclerosis.""

This protein, called soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, or suPAR, is produced by the bone marrow. It acts as a regulator, essentially a thermostat for the activity of the immune system, or ""immunostat.""

Past studies have shown suPAR to be a marker of cardiovascular disease. But this study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, is the first evidence showing that the protein actually causes atherosclerosis when at high levels.

First, the research team analyzed the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which consists of over 5,000 people without known cardiovascular disease and found that those who had higher suPAR levels were much more prone to develop atherosclerosis and experience cardiovascular events, regardless of their underlying risk factors.

Then, the investigators did a genetic study of 24,000 people to find whether certain genetic variations affected levels of suPAR in blood. They discovered a specific variant in the gene PLAUR that codes for suPAR, and people with that genetic variant tended to have higher suPAR levels. Most importantly, that genetic variant was linked to atherosclerosis in a Mendelian randomization analysis of 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank, which was replicated in two other large data sets.

""We also found that participants lacking a copy of the PLAUR gene have lower risk of heart disease,"" said first author and geneticist George Hindy, M.D., Ph.D., of Regeneron Genetics Center. ""Altogether, the genetic data is truly compelling for high suPAR being a cause of atherosclerosis.""

Finally, in mouse models with high suPAR levels, researchers saw a dramatic increase in atherosclerotic plaques of mouse aortas compared to mice with normal suPAR levels.

""Even prior to developing atherosclerosis, the mouse aortas with high suPAR levels contained more inflammatory white blood cells, and the immune cells circulating in blood were in an activated state, or 'attack-mode,'"" said Daniel Tyrrell, Ph.D., co-first author and research fellow at the U-M Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center. ""High suPAR levels appear to activate the immune cells and prime them to overreact to the high cholesterol environment, causing these cells to enter the blood vessel wall and accelerate the development of atherosclerosis.""

What is unique about this study, Hayek says, is that it brings to light high-quality clinical, genetic and experimental data -- all pointing to suPAR as a cause of atherosclerotic disease.

""Now, we're looking into developing treatments to reduce suPAR levels safely as a strategy to prevent and treat heart disease, especially since traditional therapies for atherosclerosis have no impact on suPAR,"" he said.

The study dovetails findings that suPAR is known to be a pathogenic factor that causes kidney disease, which impacts one in seven Americans. People often experience the two conditions together: two-thirds of people with kidney disease are affected by cardiovascular disease, and over 40% of patients with cardiovascular disease have signs of kidney disease.

""This paper places suPAR as the link between kidney and cardiovascular disease; a common factor causing both through this inappropriate, persistent activation of the immune system,"" said co-author Jochen Reiser, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the Department of Medicine at Rush University and an expert in the study of suPAR. ""This is pointed out in the Mendelian randomization genetic analysis done by the investigators, showing that high suPAR is also linked to kidney disease.""

For both conditions, suPAR has long been known as a biomarker for poor outcomes and disease progression. In a 2020 study, Hayek's team found that suPAR can worsen acute kidney injury and that blocking suPAR prevents it. A recent study led by Hayek found that levels of protein are high in patients with heart failure and predict death for patients.

Research into suPAR's role in health and disease has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years. Hayek says suPAR has great potential to be a successful treatment target for cardiovascular and kidney disease. His lab has already begun work designing anti-suPAR therapies and planning clinical trials.

""My hope is that we are able to provide these treatments to our patients within the next three to five years,"" he said. ""This will be a game changer for the treatment of atherosclerotic and kidney disease.""

293,"Finding may lead to therapies that prevent pituitary tumor recurrence.

A small study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health suggests that mutations in the gene CABLES1 may lead to Cushing syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body overproduces the stress hormone cortisol. The study appears online in Endocrine-Related Cancer.

The excess cortisol found in Cushing syndrome can result from certain steroid medications or from tumors of the pituitary or adrenal glands. Symptoms of the disease include obesity, muscle weakness, fatigue, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, depression and anxiety.

Researchers at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), in collaboration with researchers at other institutions in the United States, France and Canada, scanned tumor and cell tissue from 146 children with pituitary tumors evaluated for Cushing syndrome at the NIH Clinical Center. Researchers also scanned the genes of tumors from some of the children. Investigators in France scanned the genes of an additional 35 adult patients with Cushing syndrome and pituitary tumors.

The research team found that four of the patients have mutant forms of CABLES1 that do not respond to cortisol. This is significant because, when functioning normally, the CABLES1 protein, expressed by the CABLES1 gene, slows the division and growth of pituitary cells that produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). In turn, ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol, which then acts on the pituitary gland to halt the growth of ACTH-producing cells, effectively suppressing any tumor development. Because cortisol does not affect the four mutant forms of CABLES1 discovered by the researchers, these genes leave production of ACTH-releasing cells unchecked.

“The mutations we identified impair the tumor suppressor function in the pituitary gland,” said the study’s senior author Constantine A. Stratakis, M.D., director of the NICHD Division of Intramural Research. “This discovery could lead to the development of treatment strategies that simulate the function of the CABLES1 protein and prevent recurrence of pituitary tumors in people with Cushing syndrome.”

The study authors noted that the CABLES1 mutants were found in a small proportion of patients and that other genes have been implicated in pituitary tumor formation. They added that more studies are needed to fully understand how CABLES1 suppresses tumor formation in the pituitary gland.

294,"Marijuana and hallucinogen use in the past year reported by young adults 19 to 30 years old increased significantly in 2021 compared to five and 10 years ago, reaching historic highs in this age group since 1988, according to the Monitoring the Future (MTF) panel study. Rates of past-month nicotine vaping, which have been gradually increasing in young adults for the past four years, also continued their general upward trend in 2021, despite leveling off in 2020. Past-month marijuana vaping, which had significantly decreased in 2020, rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.

Alcohol remains the most used substance among adults in the study, though past-year, past-month, and daily drinking have been decreasing over the past decade. Binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks) rebounded in 2021 from a historic low in 2020, during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, high-intensity drinking (having 10 or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks) has been steadily increasing over the past decade and in 2021 reached its highest level ever recorded since first measured in 2005.

""As the drug landscape shifts over time, this data provides a window into the substances and patterns of use favored by young adults. We need to know more about how young adults are using drugs like marijuana and hallucinogens, and the health effects that result from consuming different potencies and forms of these substances,"" said National Institute on Drug Abuse Director Nora Volkow, M.D. ""Young adults are in a critical life stage and honing their ability to make informed choices. Understanding how substance use can impact the formative choices in young adulthood is critical to help position the new generations for success.""

Since 1975, the Monitoring the Future study (https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future) has annually surveyed substance use behaviors and attitudes among a nationally representative sample of teens. A longitudinal panel study component of MTF conducts follow-up surveys on a subset of these participants to track their drug use through adulthood. Participants self-report their drug use behaviors across three primary time periods -- lifetime, past year (12 months), and past month (30 days). The MTF study is conducted by scientists at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, and is funded by NIDA, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Data for the 2021 survey were collected online from April 2021 through October 2021. Key findings in the young adult group include:

Marijuana Use: Past-year, past-month, and daily marijuana use (use on 20 or more occasions in the past 30 days) reached the highest levels ever recorded since these trends were first monitored in 1988. The proportion of young adults who reported past-year marijuana use reached 43% in 2021, a significant increase from 34% five years ago (2016) and 29% 10 years ago (2011). Marijuana use in the past month was reported by 29% of young adults in 2021, compared to 21% in 2016 and 17% in 2011. Daily marijuana use also significantly increased during these time periods, reported by 11% of young adults in 2021, compared to 8% in 2016 and 6% in 2011.

Hallucinogen Use: Past-year hallucinogen use had been relatively stable over the past few decades until 2020, when reports of use started to increase dramatically. In 2021, 8% of young adults reported past-year hallucinogen use, representing an all-time high since the category was first surveyed in 1988. By comparison, in 2016, 5% of young adults reported past-year hallucinogen use, and in 2011, only 3% reported use. Types of hallucinogens reported by participants included LSD, MDMA, mescaline, peyote, ""shrooms"" or psilocybin, and PCP. The only hallucinogen measured that significantly decreased in use was MDMA (also called ecstasy or Molly), showing statistically significant decreases within one year as well as the past five years -- from 5% in both 2016 and 2020 to 3% in 2021.

Vaping: Nicotine vaping in the past month increased significantly among young adults in 2021 despite leveling off in 2020 during the earlier part of the pandemic. The continued increase in 2021 reflects a general long-term upward trend: in 2021, nicotine vaping prevalence nearly tripled to 16% compared to 6% in 2017, when the behavior was first recorded.

Prevalence of marijuana vaping in the past month among young adults had significantly dipped in 2020 but returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Since 2017, when marijuana vaping was included in this study, past-month prevalence has doubled -- from 6% in 2017 to 12% in 2021.

Alcohol Use: Reports of binge drinking by young adults -- defined as having five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks -- returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 after significantly decreasing in 2020 (32% reported in 2021, versus 28% in 2020 and 32% in 2019). High-intensity drinking, defined as having 10 or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks, was at its highest level since it was first measured in 2005, reported by 13% of young adults in 2021, compared with 11% in 2005. However, past-month and past-year alcohol use, and daily drinking have been on a downward trend in young adults for the past 10 years. For example, in 2021, 66% of young adults reported alcohol use in the past 30 days, a significant decline from 70% recorded in 2016 and 69% in 2011.

The study also showed significant decreases in past-month cigarette smoking by young adults and non-medical use of opioid medications in the past year (surveyed as ""narcotics other than heroin"") compared to 10 years ago. Both substances have been declining steadily in use for the past decade. Additional data from the 2021 MTF panel study include drug use reported by adults 35 to 50 years old, college/non-college young adults, and among various demographic subgroups.

""One of the best ways we can learn more about drug use and its impact on people is to observe which drugs are appearing, in which populations, for how long, and under which contexts,"" said Megan Patrick, Ph.D., a research professor at the University of Michigan and principal investigator of the MTF panel study. ""Monitoring the Future and similar large-scale surveys on a consistent sample population allow us to assess the effects of 'natural experiments' like the pandemic. We can examine how and why drugs are used and highlight critical areas to guide where the research should go next and to inform public health interventions.""

Though exercise is, in general, health-promoting, it is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death for a small number of individuals who harbor cardiac conditions.
Sudden cardiac death is the most common medical cause of death in athletes, with an incidence of around 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 80,000 athletes per year according to the most recent estimates.
The risk and causes of sudden cardiac death vary based upon the athlete population. Male gender, black race, and basketball participation all place an athlete at higher risk. Sudden cardiac death in younger athletes (< 35 years) is commonly due to inherited cardiac conditions, while in older athletes (> 35 years) it is most often due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.

297,"A scientific analysis of more than 2,000 brain scans found evidence for highly reproducible sex differences in the volume of certain regions in the human brain. This pattern of sex-based differences in brain volume corresponds with patterns of sex-chromosome gene expression observed in postmortem samples from the brain’s cortex, suggesting that sex chromosomes may play a role in the development or maintenance of sex differences in brain anatomy. The study, led by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), part of the National Institutes of Health, is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Developing a clearer understanding of sex differences in human brain organization has great importance for how we think about well-established sex differences in cognition, behavior, and risk for psychiatric illness. We were inspired by new findings on sex differences in animal models and wanted to try to close the gap between these animal data and our models of sex differences in the human brain,” said Armin Raznahan, M.D., Ph.D., study co-author and chief of the NIMH Section on Developmental Neurogenomics.

Researchers have long observed consistent sex-based differences in subcortical brain structures in mice. Some studies have suggested these anatomical differences are largely due to the effects of sex hormones, lending weight to a “gonad-centric” explanation for sex-based differences in brain development. However, more recent mouse studies have revealed consistent sex differences in cortical structures, as well, and gene-expression data suggest that sex chromosomes may play a role in shaping these anatomical sex differences. Although the mouse brain shares many similarities with the human brain, it is not clear whether these key findings in mice also apply to humans.

To explore the neurobiological basis of sex differences in the human brain, Raznahan, lead author Siyuan Liu, Ph.D., and colleagues first analyzed neuroimaging data collected as part of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The data, obtained from 976 healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 35, revealed consistent sex differences in the volume of certain cortical structures. On average, females had relatively greater cortical volume in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, and lateral parietal cortex. Males, on average, had relatively greater cortical volume in ventral temporal regions and occipital regions, including the temporal pole, fusiform gyrus, and primary visual cortex.

Liu and colleagues then used two complementary approaches to determine whether these findings were reproducible. First, the researchers conducted 1,000 split-half comparisons by randomly splitting the HCP dataset in half and comparing results in the two halves. The results of these split-half comparisons indicated that the pattern of sex-based differences in cortical volume was highly stable. Second, the researchers quantified the reproducibility of the HCP findings in an unrelated neuroimaging dataset from the UK Biobank. Although the datasets had notable demographic and methodological differences, the researchers found that the overall pattern of sex-based differences in cortical volume was highly consistent.

Liu and co-authors then cross-referenced their anatomical findings with publicly available maps of gene-expression in the brain, which are based on 1,317 postmortem tissue samples from six human donors. The results indicated that the spatial pattern of sex differences in cortical volume was similar to the spatial pattern of sex-chromosome gene expression in the cortex. Specifically, regions of the cortex with relatively high expression of sex-chromosome genes tended to have greater cortical volume in males than females.

This correspondence with cortical expression of sex-chromosome genes is also consistent with findings from earlier mouse studies, suggesting that sex differences in brain anatomy may be due, at least in part, to genetic mechanisms that have been conserved throughout mammalian evolution. These findings suggest that sex differences in cortical volume may be influenced by genes located on the X and Y sex chromosomes.

“Males and females differ on many genetic and environmental factors that could all potentially influence brain development. Because it is challenging to experiment in humans, we often rely on observational data to infer potential genetic or environmental drivers of brain sex differences,” said Raznahan. “The fact that we observed a very high level of reproducibility of anatomical sex differences across different groups of males and females, and a link between these differences and sex chromosome gene expression, suggests these differences are likely not primarily the result of environmental effects alone.”

The researchers also compared the anatomical findings with data from more than 11,000 functional neuroimaging studies. The results indicated spatial overlap between areas of the brain that showed sex-based differences in cortical volume in the HCP dataset and areas of the brain associated with face processing in functional neuroimaging studies.

Taken together, these findings shed light on the mechanisms that may contribute to sex-based differences in brain anatomy and point to genetic factors that may contribute to sex-based differences in brain disease and behavior. With these correlational findings as a roadmap, future research can more efficiently investigate the causes and consequences of sex differences in the human brain.

Just 3% of flu tests are coming back positive, according to the CDC’s weekly Fluview report. Case counts for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) emergency department visits are now below summertime levels. Both illnesses raged in record-shattering fashion just a couple of months ago.

“This flu season started really early because there were so many children with zero experience with flu, common colds, and RSV,” David Celentano, ScD, chair of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Vox.

Data is now pointing to what may amount to simply an early peak for flu and RSV. About 25 million people in the U.S. have had the flu this year and 17,000 people have died of it.

303,"NIH-developed test detects protein associated with Alzheimer’s and CTE

Findings could lead to early diagnosis, better treatment studies.

An ultrasensitive test has been developed that detects a corrupted protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition found in athletes, military veterans, and others with a history of repetitive brain trauma. This advance could lead to early diagnosis of these conditions and open new research into how they originate, according to National Institutes of Health scientists and their colleagues. In their new study, published in Acta Neuropathologica, the researchers explain how they adapted a diagnostic test originally developed for prion diseases to detect abnormal clusters of tau protein. Like other proteins involved in neurological diseases, tau protein clusters can seed themselves and contribute substantially to the disease processes of Alzheimer’s and CTE. The study involved brain samples from 16 Alzheimer’s patients, two boxers with CTE, and numerous control cases involving other brain diseases.

The test is extremely sensitive. For example, if a pinhead-sized sample of brain tissue from an Alzheimer’s patient were pulverized and diluted into a thousand gallons of liquid, the test still could detect tau seeds in a pinhead-sized volume of that dilution. The test is called AD RT-QuIC: Alzheimer’s disease real-time quaking induced conversion.

Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases developed RT-QuIC about a decade ago to detect Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) and other prion diseases. Since then, they have repeatedly improved and adapted it to detect other neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s and dementia with Lewy bodies. The test, which already is used in clinical settings to diagnose sporadic CJD, is noted for its rapid and accurate results.

Their latest findings could be a major advance for Alzheimer’s diagnostics because the study points to tau seeds as potential biological “markers” for Alzheimer’s disease in the brain. Scientists are testing therapies to slow the accumulation of tau clusters and the progression of neurological disease. In these efforts, they need more sensitive and accurate tests to better select clinical trial participants and assess whether new therapeutic strategies work as hoped.

Alzheimer’s affects about 5.7 million people in the United States alone at an estimated annual cost of $232 billion, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.

304,"Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among the working-age population. A new study in the American Journal of Pathology reports that visual function in diabetic mice was significantly improved after treatment with a single dose of visual chromophore 9-cis-retinal, a vitamin A analog that can form a visual pigment in the retina cells, thereby producing a light sensitive element of the retina.

""In an earlier study we found that diabetes causes vitamin A deficiency in the retina, which results in deterioration of vision, even before any vascular changes can be seen. That finding led to the assumption that early changes in vision in diabetes are probably caused by vitamin A deficiency in the retina,"" explained lead investigator Gennadiy Moiseyev, PhD, Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.

In the current study investigators hypothesized that treating diabetic mice with 11-cis-retinal could rescue visual function. They investigated its effect in Akita mice, a genetic model of type 1 diabetes, by measuring electroretinogram (ERG) responses, retinal oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis (cell death). ERG was performed on two groups of three-month-old Akita mice and one group of non-diabetic control mice matched for age and genetic background. One group of Akita mice was treated with 9-cis-retinal and the other with a vehicle solution. Average blood glucose concentrations and body weights of the mice were measured monthly during the study. Akita mice showed high glucose concentrations throughout the study. ERG recordings and rhodopsin assay were performed two hours after 9-cis-retinal injection, whereas assessment of cell death by ELISA and TUNEL assay were both performed 24 hours after the injection.

Results showed that the visual function in diabetic mice improved significantly after treatment with the single dose of 9-cis-retinal. In addition, researchers reported that the treatment reduced oxidative stress in the retina, decreased retina cell death and retina degeneration, and improved visual function.

""This work supports our novel hypothesis that diabetes-induced disturbance of the vitamin A metabolism in the eye is responsible for reduced visual function in early stages of diabetic retinopathy,"" commented Dr. Moiseyev. ""Currently, there is no available therapy to prevent the development of the retinal complication in patients suffering from diabetes. This study suggests that the delivery of visual chromophore to the diabetic eye may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the early stages of diabetic retinopathy to prevent vision loss in patients with diabetes.""

Traditionally, diabetic retinopathy was considered a disease caused by the pathology of blood vessels in the retina, whereby light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (fundus) becomes damaged. Patients with diabetes often experience functional deficits in dark adaptation, contrast sensitivity, and color perception before any microvascular pathologies are detected on the eye fundus. However, recent data underscore the importance of vitamin A for normal visual function. It serves as a precursor for light-sensitive 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments that can produce a light-sensitive protein in the retina.",0

The important statistic here is the rate of death for each group. Percentage wise, the proportion of deaths remains higher in those who are unvaccinated, compared to those who are vaccinated. ... As you can see [in Table 14 of the VSR below], in every age group (barring in this report the very low numbers in the 18-29 age group under the 'deaths within 28-days' column), the rate of death is higher in those who are unvaccinated, compared to those who are vaccinated with at least three doses.

310,"A Purdue University engineer's patent-pending invention could improve the quality of life for millions of people suffering from diabetic foot ulcers.

Rahim Rahimi, an assistant professor in the School of Materials Engineering, has developed a flexible polymer composite microneedle array that can overcome the physicochemical bacterial biofilm present in chronic, nonhealing wounds and deliver both oxygen and bactericidal agents simultaneously. The results have been published in ACS Applied Bio Materials.

""The biofilm acts as a shield, hindering antibiotics from reaching infected cells and tissues,"" Rahimi said. ""When these microneedles pierce through the shield, they absorb the fluid underneath and dissolve, which delivers the antibiotic directly to the ulcerated cells and tissues.""

Rahimi said the traditional method to bypass biofilm is for physicians to peel it off, which is painful to patients and doesn't discriminate unhealthy tissue from healthy tissue.

""The microneedles don't cause pain because they are not long enough to touch nerve endings in the foot,"" he said. ""In this published study, the team assessed the microneedles on ex vivo porcine wound models. In fewer than five minutes, the microneedles dissolved, the antibiotic was delivered and the patch was removed.""

The lack of proper treatment of infected ulcers can lead to bacteremia and sepsis. As a result, chronic wounds are one of the key causes of limb amputations.

The next step to developing the microneedles beyond the proof-of-concept stage is to find partners to conduct human tests. Rahimi has disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. OTC has filed a patent application on the intellectual property.

314,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― Human bodies constantly produce thousands of perfectly folded proteins, but some proteins get misfolded. An excess of these misfolded proteins can overwhelm the body's ability to remove them. When that happens, the rogue proteins bind together and form a substance called amyloid. Webs of amyloid can deposit in any tissue or organ, but some types affect the heart.

Martha Grogan, M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and director of the Cardiac Amyloid Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, says the treatment approach depends on two important factors: early diagnosis and knowing which type of amyloid a person has.

Three types of amyloid can affect the human heart:
• Light chain amyloid 

 This type progresses quickly and has the worst prognosis. It is produced in the bone marrow and can be deposited in any tissue or organ. This type of amyloid causes organ failure or neurological damage. Treatment may include chemotherapy or stem cell transplant with a patient's own cells.
• Wild type transthyretin amyloid 

 This type originates in the liver and becomes unstable. It typically shows up in men over age 60. Carpal tunnel syndrome or spinal stenosis is common, often occurring six to 10 years before wild type transthyretin is diagnosed. New medication options are available to stabilize protein or prevent protein folding.
• Hereditary type transthyretin amyloid

 This type originates in the liver. It is caused by mutations of the transthyretin gene. A single copy of the gene variation is enough to cause the condition. Effects vary. Not everyone with the gene variation gets amyloidosis. This type is rare, except in black Americans. Treatment can include a liver or heart transplant. New medication options are available to prevent the protein from being produced, or to stabilize protein and prevent misfolding.

Each type causes irreversible thickening of the heart muscle and can lead to congestive heart failure. But each of these cardiac amyloid types has distinct differences. For example, people of African or Caribbean descent are at increased risk of hereditary type transthyretin amyloid.

Dr. Grogan says amyloidosis is tricky to diagnose because layers of amyloid build up over time. At first, there are no symptoms. Later, the symptoms often imitate other conditions. A health care provider may suspect cardiac amyloidosis if a patient's echocardiogram or MRI shows certain heart characteristics, such as thickened walls, abnormal strain and restricted filling of blood. A patient may have unexplained heart failure, stroke or atrial arrhythmia that can be traced back to amyloid. Kidney disease, an unexplained rise in lipids and signs of neural damage also may be present.

""When cardiac amyloid is suspected, the first thing is to find out what type it is because that will guide treatment. There is no medication available at this time that has been proven to take amyloid out of the heart, but we can stop more amyloid from being produced by treating the underlying protein problem,"" says Dr. Grogan.

Using a tissue biopsy taken from the fat, bone marrow, kidney or heart, a pathologist uses a technique called mass spectrometryto examine the tissue and determine the type of amyloid. If light chain amyloid is ruled out by blood and urine tests, then a biopsy is not always needed. In this setting, a pyrophosphate scan may be used to see if transthyretin amyloid is present in the heart. If the patient has transthyretin type, the next step is genetic testing to see if there is an inherited variation that is causing the amyloid.

""The hereditary form of transthyretin amyloid is generally rare. However, we know that approximately 4% of the black population in the U.S. carries the gene. Not all of these people develop amyloidosis, but this is a huge population at risk,"" says Dr. Grogan.

315,"July 5, 2022 – A new combination vaccine for COVID-19 will likely be coming out this fall, offering more protection against the Omicron variants of COVID-19. Vaccine maker Moderna said in a recent news release that the new vaccine is expected to be a “lead candidate” as a booster shot in the fall. But as the CDC has doubled down on its recommendations for those who are eligible to get their second booster, some are questioning the timing and choice of their fourth shot. Here are the answers to some common questions about boosters. Should I get a second booster if I recently tested positive for COVID-19? According to CDC recommendations, it is best to wait until your symptoms have ended before getting a second booster shot. The CDC says that some may want to consider waiting 3 months after the start of COVID-19 symptoms to receive a second booster shot, but the only requirement is that you no longer have to self-isolate. Should I expect any different side effects from the second booster? Hannah Newman, the director of infection prevention at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, says side effects from a second booster are different from person to person. “Side effects are very short-lived and can be treated with supportive medication,” she says. According to experts at Johns Hopkins Medicine common side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations include fever, body aches, chills, and swollen lymph nodes. But these symptoms are a sign that “your immune system is responding to the shots,” they say Should I try to time my second booster with the expected surge of COVID-19 cases in the fall? Newman recommends getting the second booster as soon as you can. “There is a high level of community transmission right now, so it’s better to get it as soon as you are eligible to allow time to build up antibodies.” Amesh Adalja, MD, an assistant professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, says it takes “probably 7 days or so until you reach the peak protection for the immune system to have reacted.”

Should immunocompromised people consider getting a second booster? The FDA has authorized second booster shots for anybody over the age of 50 and people over the age of 12 who are immunocompromised. Newman says a second booster can offer immunocompromised people more protection from COVID-19. “If they ended up having a breakthrough infection, it would ensure their symptoms would be milder, in theory,” she says. How does the new Novavax vaccine affect COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters? A panel of advisers to the FDA says the Novavax vaccine for COVID-19 should be granted emergency use authorization, although the agency itself has not yet agreed. The Novavax shots are protein-based vaccines, meaning that they inject the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus into your body. Protein-based vaccines have been used for decades. Common vaccines like those for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) use this method. These are different from the mRNA-based Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which give your body the instructions to make the spike protein so your immune system can learn to recognize it in the future. William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says unvaccinated Americans may be more likely get the Novavax shot if they are skeptical of mRNA vaccines, saying “Novavax is made from more traditional methods, so we may be able to add more people to the vaccinated cohort.” If I have had three doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, can I switch to Moderna for the fourth? You can get a different second booster that is different from the primary series and first booster you received. A study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health found that using different vaccines as a first booster was safe and effective. A lot could be riding on whether a combination vaccine designed to target two coronavirus strains in one product gains FDA authorization and CDC recommendations for use as an updated booster. In the meantime, Ashish Jha, MD, the White House COVID-19 Response Team coordinator, reassured reporters during a June 23 White House briefing that there would be enough of this combination – known as a bivalent vaccine – for high-risk Americans going into fall and winter. But he said that without new COVID-19 funding from Congress, “we will not have enough vaccines for every American who wants one.”",0

318,"Nov. 4, 2022 – Alcohol deaths spiked during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the age-adjusted rate of alcohol-induced deaths increasing 26% from 2019 to 2020, the CDC reported Friday. About 49,000 people died from alcohol-related reasons in 2020, rising from around 39,000 in the previous year. Alcohol caused 13.1 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2020, up from 10.4 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2019, the CDC said, citing data from the National Vital Statistics System. Alcohol deaths have gone up about 7% a year from 2000 to 2018, the CDC said, but the isolation and fear caused by the pandemic apparently caused people to drink more. “We know that in large-scale traumatic events to the population – like 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina – people historically start drinking more. The pandemic has been, as we all know, a major stressor to our lives,” George F. Koob, PhD, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, told CNN.

“What we’ve been picking up with numerous small studies is that about 25% of the population increased their drinking, and these individuals were people who were drinking to cope with stress. And many people who drink to cope with stress inevitably go on to have an alcohol use disorder.” The death rate was highest for men in the 55-to-64 age group, with about 60 deaths for every 100,000 people, the CDC said. For women, the highest death rate also occurred in the 55-to-64 age group, with about 21 deaths per 100,000 people. For men in all age groups, alcohol deaths per 100,000 people went from 15.2 in 2019 to 19.2 in 2020. For women in all age groups, those deaths rose from 5.9 to 7.5 over that time period. Deaths rose 50% from alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis, 33% from mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol, and 23% from alcoholic liver disease, the CDC said. The report covers deaths directly related to drinking, such as alcoholic liver disease and alcohol poisoning. Not included were unintentional injuries, homicides, and deaths indirectly or partially related to alcohol use, the CDC said.",0

323,"Gardening is one of the daily activities experts say women can do to improve their heart health. 

Dimitrije Tanaskovic/Stocksy United
• Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States.
• Experts say exercise is one way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
• In a new study, researchers say older women don’t necessarily have to do daily intense exercise to improve their heart health.
• They say daily activities such as gardening, housework, and stretching for 4 hours a day can reduce the risk of heart disease. Women tend to have from cardiovascular disease than men. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the of death for women in the United States. Thankfully, everyone can take precautionary measures to maintain heart health. For example, it’s well-known that regular exercise is good for the cardiovascular system. And you don’t need to run a mile or head to the gym every day to reap the benefits, either. Here we’ll dive into a new study on the relationship between daily movement and heart health in older women.

New study on exercise and heart disease risk A published in the the Journal of the American Heart Association looked at how daily movement affects heart health in older women in the United States. Scientists measured the physical activity of more than 5,400 women in the United States between the ages of 63 and 97 without heart disease at the start of the study. Participants wore an accelerometer for up to 7 days to measure how much time they spent moving and listed the types of daily life behaviors that resulted in movement. Each minute was classified as: Researchers reported that performing routine activities, classified as daily life movement, for 4 hours per day can lower the risk of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease by 43 percent and stroke by 30 percent, compared to women with 2 hours of daily life movement. In addition, the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was decreased by 62 percent.

“Sometimes things go against what you think or have been taught,” said Dr. Leonard Pianko, FACC, the founder and medical director of the Aventura Cardiovascular Center in Florida. “Previously, exercise focus was generally on intensity, increasing your heart rate, and sweating,” Pianko told Healthline. “This study shows us the importance of just keeping active, moving, and making the commitment to daily movement.” “The study results do not negate the benefits of daily structured exercise like running or swimming, but it does show that there are other opportunities that are more palatable (and less injury-prone) that provide the benefits of protecting women from heart disease,” he said. So, what are some ways to obtain daily life movement? “There are many benefits of exercise: weight loss, less stress, and improved mood. But, you do not have to join a gym or run around the block every day,” said Reda Elmardi, a registered dietitian and certified strength and conditioning specialist trainer. “I suggest that older women get moving in the morning,” Elmardi told Healthline. “When you engage in physical activity in the morning, your muscles are primed to work harder and longer. You’ll feel better throughout the rest of the day because you gave yourself a healthy boost of energy.” There are many ways to increase your movement during the day, including:
• standing or walking while talking on the phone
• parking further from work or shopping entrances
• taking the steps instead of the elevator or escalator Before modifying your activity levels, it’s a good idea to talk to a doctor about safe options that might be right for you.",0
324,"NIH names Dr. Rena D’Souza as director of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research

National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., has selected Rena N. D’Souza, D.D.S., M.S., Ph.D., as director of NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). A licensed dentist, Dr. D’Souza is currently the assistant vice president for academic affairs and education for health sciences at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. There she also serves as a professor of dentistry, the Ole and Marty Jensen Chair of the School of Dentistry and professor of neurobiology and anatomy, pathology and surgery in the School of Medicine and the Department of Biomedical Engineering. She is expected to begin her new role as the NIDCR director later this year.

“Dr. D’Souza is renowned for her research in craniofacial development, genetics, tooth development and regenerative dental medicine. She has worked as a proponent for NIH for decades, serving on critical advisory committees and as an expert consultant on multiple projects,” said Dr. Collins. “I look forward to having her join the NIH leadership team later this year. I also want to thank NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence A. Tabak, D.D.S., Ph.D., for his valuable leadership as the acting director of NIDCR since January 1, 2020.”

325,"Study provides an early recipe for rewiring spinal cords

NIH-funded preclinical results suggest returning nerve cells to a younger state could aid in repair.

For many years, researchers have thought that the scar that forms after a spinal cord injury actively prevents damaged neurons from regrowing. In a study of rodents, scientists supported by the National Institutes of Health showed they could overcome this barrier and reconnect severed spinal cord nerves by turning back the neurons’ clocks to put them into an early growth state. Once this occurs, neurons could be induced to regrow across the scarred tissue. The research was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of NIH.

“For decades researchers have been trying to make severed neurons regrow across a spinal cord injury and reconnect with neurons on the other side. This study suggests that may require manipulating three key growth processes,” said Lyn Jakeman, Ph.D., program director, NINDS. “These insights are important for understanding the mechanisms of injury and regeneration that may one day be applied to develop potential treatments for spinal cord injury.”

Neurons send signals to each other through long projections called axons. When the spinal cord is injured, many of these axons are severed, leading to a loss of sensation and/or paralysis below the injury site. In response, a scar forms within the damaged tissue, and while the axons may briefly attempt to regrow, this process is unsuccessful. Because these connections between neurons are made initially as the body is developing, researchers have sought to restore those developmental conditions to potentially help the damaged cord heal.

“There are several growth patterns in the spinal cord that shut down after development,” said Michael V. Sofroniew, M.D., Ph.D., professor at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA and senior author of the study published in Nature. “We wanted to see if we could reactivate those patterns following injury and whether that would lead to regrowth of the axons.”

Using both mouse and rat spinal cord injury models, the researchers from UCLA and their collaborators at Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland, looked at three components of the regrowth process.

First, they tried to genetically turn back the neurons’ clock by reactivating the growth program that produced the original connections, specifically neurons that look like they are trying to regrow. While not active in adults, the neurons still carry the program used during early growth. By injecting viruses containing genes related to this program, the researchers were able to revert spinal cord neurons back to a state where axon growth could occur.

Second, the new axons needed to travel through the damaged tissue. Normally, growing axons move along highways paved with molecules that are not found in the scar tissue. After injecting the injury site with a gel containing a combination of growth-promoting proteins, the scientists saw an increase in axon-supportive molecules, effectively providing a “road” across the injury.

Finally, the growing axons needed to exit the injury site and find targets. During development, neurons release proteins called chemoattractants that axons home in on. To mimic this, the researchers injected chemoattractant proteins in a trail beyond the injury site and saw that these “chemical breadcrumbs” successfully led axons to grow completely through the injury site.

When any of the three treatments — viral activation of the growth program, formation of the path for axon travel, and the addition of chemoattractants — were not provided, minimal, if any regrowth was seen. In contrast, when all three were used in the order described, the neurons grew robustly. Tens or hundreds of axons traveled across the scar and reconnected with neurons on the other side.

Although their results suggest that the new connections could conduct electrical signals across the injury, the rodents could not move any better. However, Dr. Sofroniew emphasized that this was not unexpected.

“We would expect that these regrown axons would behave very much like the new axons we see in development,” he explained. “Much like a newborn must learn to walk, these newly formed circuits will probably require training before functional recovery can be seen.”

Spinal cord trauma affects roughly 12,500 people in the United States each year, and an estimated 276,000 individuals in the U.S. currently live with the long-term effects of spinal cord injury. The goal of research into spinal cord injury is to restore connections severed by the injury to provide functional recovery.

Dr. Sofroniew and his colleagues are now looking to continue to refine their understanding of the mechanisms involved in axon regeneration and to determine how newly wired circuits can best be retrained to restore movement.

This work was supported by NIH grants (NS084030, NS096858, NS096294, NS062691), the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Foundation, the International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia, Craig H. Neilsen Foundation, European Research Council, Swiss National Science Foundation, and Wings for Life.

This press release describes a basic research finding. Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology, which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Science is an unpredictable and incremental process — each research advance builds on past discoveries, often in unexpected ways. Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic research.

NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.

More than one in four adults sickened by the virus go on to have long COVID, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall, nearly 15% of all American adults – more than 38 million people nationwide – have had long COVID at some point since the start of the pandemic, according to the report. The report, based on survey data collected between March 1 and 13, defines long COVID as symptoms lasting at least 3 months that people didn’t have before getting infected with the virus. It is the second recent look at who is most likely to face long COVID. A similar study, published last month, found that women, smokers, and those who had severe COVID-19 infections are most likely to have the disorder

The Census Bureau report found that while 27% of adults nationwide have had long COVID after getting infected with the virus, the condition has impacted some states more than others. The proportion of residents hit with long COVID ranged from a low of 18.8% in New Jersey to a high of 40.7% in West Virginia. Other states with long COVID rates well below the national average include Alaska, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin. At the other end of the spectrum, the states with rates well above the national average include Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Long COVID rates also varied by age, gender, and race. People in their 50s were most at risk, with about 31% of those infected by the virus going on to have long COVID, followed by those in their 40s, at more than 29%. Far more women (almost 33%) than men (21%) with COVID infections got long COVID. And when researchers looked at long COVID rates based on gender identity, they found that transgender adults were more than twice as likely to have long COVID than cisgender males. Bisexual adults also had much higher long COVID rates than straight, gay, or lesbian people.

Long COVID was also much more common among Hispanic adults, affecting almost 29% of those infected with the virus, than among White or Black people, who had long COVID rates similar to the national average of 27%. Asian adults had lower long COVID rates than the national average, at less than 20%.

333,"Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) researchers at Harvard University and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT have found evidence that bone marrow transplantation may one day be beneficial to a subset of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

ALS destroys the neurons connecting the brain and spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. As those neurons die, patients progressively lose the ability to move, speak, eat, and breathe.

The mouse-model study, published this week in Science Translational Medicine, suggests the most common genetic mutation associated with ALS plays an important role in not only the nervous system, but also the blood and immune systems.

""The point of our paper was to determine the function of this gene and what it normally helps to do in the body,"" said lead author Kevin Eggan, a professor in Harvard's Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB) and an HSCI principal faculty member who has been studying ALS for more than a decade. According to Eggan, one way to better understand the gene is to catalog what is missing or goes awry when it is ""knocked out,"" or inactivated.

The scientists found that mice without a functional copy of the gene C9ORF72 had abnormally large spleens, livers, and lymph nodes, and got sick and died. Mice with one working copy experienced similar but less severe changes.

""I realized immediately that the mouse knockout had immune dysfunction,"" said Leonard Zon, a professor in HSCRB, after seeing the preliminary data at an informal presentation.

The research team predicted that the gene mutation would affect neurons, but the finding that it also inflamed other cells, namely those involved in autoimmunity, was ""unexpected."" With input from Zon and immunologist Luigi Notarangelo of Boston Children's Hospital, the team decided to change direction and further explore the gene's impact on the immune system.

First author Aaron Burberry, a postdoctoral fellow in the Eggan lab with a background in immunology, designed an experiment to test whether providing the sick mice with cells capable of making new immune cells via a bone marrow transplant would help.

Knockout mice that received a bone marrow transplant lived on average 43 days longer, weighed more, and had a greater number of blood platelets throughout their lifespan.

""The mice seemed to get better,"" said Eggan, though he stressed that the bone marrow transplant did not wholly rescue the animals, suggesting that there may also be functions of C9ORF72 in other organs.

Whether or not anti-inflammatory drugs or bone marrow transplants help ALS patients has been studied and debated for years. ""When doctors look for autoimmunity and inflammation in ALS patients there have been confusing and conflicting views,"" Eggan said. ""Some people find it, others don't.""

Historically, clinical studies have tested the general ALS population, likely without accounting for the variety of gene mutations that gave rise to individual cases. More than 100 distinct mutations in any one of 20 genes can contribute to ALS.

""Most people have their own private mutation that is making them sick,"" Eggan said, which makes developing therapies particularly complicated. He believes clinical trials could be redesigned to test the effects of bone marrow transplantation on particular subpopulations of ALS.",0

Providers of mammograms will have to tell women that their tests are harder to interpret and suggest they speak with their doctors about more testing, the FDA says.

This will lead to greater detection of breast cancer earlier, advocates say.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in American women, after skin cancers, says the American Cancer Society. This year, about 300,000 new cases will be diagnosed, and about 43,700 women will die from breast cancer, the organization says.

“Today’s action represents the agency’s broader commitment to support innovation to prevent, detect and treat cancer,” Hilary Marston, the FDA’s chief medical officer, said.

Most states require that women be told when their mammogram finds they have dense breasts. The FDA decision applies a minimum standard for 8,700 facilities across the country, and states can still require more explicit wording, The Washington Post reported.",0

341,"According to studies in recent years, air pollution affects the thyroid. Thyroid hormones are essential for regulating fetal growth and metabolism, and play an important role in neurological development. Thyroxine (T4) is the main thyroid hormone that is circulating and the thyroid-stimulating hormone is TSH. At 48 hours newborn babies undergo a heel prick test in which thyroxine and TSH levels in the blood are measured. In fact, if the balance of these thyroid hormones is not right, the risk of developing serious diseases increases. That is why, ""this study set out to analyse the relationship between atmospheric pollution during pregnancy and the level of thyroxine in the newborn,"" explained Amaia Irizar-Loibide, a researcher in the UPV/EHU's Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO ) and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 micra in diameter (PM2.5) are two of the main pollutants related to air pollution and vehicle traffic. PM2.5 particles for example are very fine and easily enter the respiratory tract. ""In this work we specifically analysed the effect of maternal exposure to these fine particles and to nitrogen dioxide during pregnancy and the link existing with thyroxine levels in newborn babies. We have been monitoring on a weekly basis, as the development of the fetus varies greatly from one week to the next. So we tried to conduct the most detailed research possible in order to find out which the most sensitive weeks of pregnancy are,"" added the UPV/EHU researcher.

So the sample of the INMA (Environment and Childhood) project in Gipuzkoa was analysed. Data on the air pollutants PM2.5 and NO , data on TSH and T4 levels from neonatal heels, etc. collected in the project were also used.

According to Amaia Irizar, ""the results obtained in this study have revealed the direct relationship between exposure to fine particles during pregnancy and the level of thyroxine in newborns. However, we have not observed a clear link with exposure to nitrogen dioxide."" These results therefore coincide with the limited previous research. ""What we have seen in this work,"" stressed Irizar, ""is that exposure during the first months of pregnancy has a direct influence on the balance of thyroid hormones. These babies tend to have a lower level of thyroxine. As the pregnancy progresses, we found that this relationship gradually diminishes, i.e. the mother's exposure gradually becomes less important. In late pregnancy, however, this link becomes apparent again, but displays an opposite effect: as the concentration of these fine particles increases, we have seen that the level of thyroid hormones also increases, which has the opposite effect on the balance."" ""It is not clear what mechanism lies behind all this. In any case, we have come to the conclusion that the most sensitive periods of pregnancy in terms of atmospheric pollution are the early and late months,"" the UPV/EHU researcher stressed.

""The next task would be to study the mechanisms by which these fine particles cause opposing effects in early and late pregnancy. In fact, these particles are nothing more than small spheres made up of carbon, and it is not clear whether the effect these spheres exert is because they pass from the placenta to the baby, whether other components attached to the particles are released once they have entered the body...,"" she explained. ""We need to continue to investigate whether exposure during pregnancy affects not only thyroid hormones, but also other aspects such as neuropsychological development, growth, obesity, etc.,"" explained Amaia Irizar.",0

344,"Aug. 25, 2022 – For years scientists have believed that aspartame and other so-called nonnutritive sweeteners had no effect on the human body. But new research published this month finds that these sugar substitutes can change your gut microbiome in a way that can influence blood sugar levels. Several years ago, a team led by Eran Elinav, MD, PhD, an immunologist and microbiome researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, found that sugar substitutes affect the microbiome of mice in ways that could affect their blood sugar. They have now confirmed in a randomized controlled trial with 120 healthy adults. Before the study, all participants strictly avoided sugar substitutes. During the trial, some continue to avoid them, while others used saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, or stevia daily for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake. Each sugar substitute ""significantly and distinctly"" altered stool and microorganisms in the mouth, and two of the sweeteners (saccharin and sucralose) significantly impacted sugar tolerance, the researchers report.

When researchers transplanted human microbiomes from fecal matter into germ-free mice, they found a link between microbiomes altered by sugar substitutes and sugar tolerance in mice. The effects of these sweeteners will likely vary from person to person because of the unique make-up of an individual's microbiome. ""We need to raise awareness of the fact that” sugar substitutes do affect the human body, despite what was originally believed, Elinav said in a news release. “With that said, the clinical health implications of the changes they may elicit in humans remain unknown and merit future long-term studies. "" For now, Elinav says it's his personal view that ""drinking only water seems to be the best solution."" Several experts weighed in on the results in a statement from the U.K. nonprofit organization, Science Media Centre. Duane Mellor, PhD, registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University in the UK said the study does not show a link between all sugar substitutes and higher blood sugar levels in the long term. ""It did suggest, though, that some individuals who do not normally consume sweeteners may not tolerate glucose as well after consuming six [packets] of either saccharin or sucralose mixed with glucose per day,"" Mellor says.",0

348,"There's no one way to quit smoking, but to quit, you must be ready both emotionally and mentally. You must also want to quit smoking for yourself, not to please your friends or family. It helps to plan ahead. This guide will help you get started. What Should I Do First? Your first days of not smoking will be the hardest. You should pick a date to quit smoking and then stick to it. Write down your reasons for quitting before your quit day and read the list every day before and after you quit. You should also come up with a quit plan. It will help you stay focused and motivated. Here are some ideas to get you started:
• Write down when you smoke, why you smoke, and what you are doing when you smoke. These are your smoking triggers. You need to avoid these as often as possible going forward.
• Stop smoking in certain situations (such as during your work break or after dinner) before actually quitting.
• Make a list of activities you can do instead of smoking, like taking a brisk walk or chewing a piece of gum. You have to be ready to do something else when you want to smoke.
• Ask your doctor about using nicotine replacement therapy gum or patches. Some people find these helpful in curbing cravings.
• Join a smoking cessation support group or program. Call your local chapter of the American Lung Association to find groups near you.
• Tell your friends and family about your quit smoking plan, and let them know how they can support you. Why Is Smoking So Addictive? Blame nicotine, the main drug in tobacco, for your smoking addiction. Your brain quickly adapts to it and craves more and more to feel the way you used to feel after smoking just one cigarette. Over time, your brain learns to predict when you're going to smoke a cigarette. You feel down and tired, so you think, ""I need a cigarette,"" and the cycle starts again. But it's not just about brain chemistry. Certain situations make you want to smoke. Everyone's triggers are different. Yours might include the smell of cigarette smoke, seeing a carton of cigarettes at the store, eating certain foods, or drinking your morning coffee. Sometimes just the way you feel (sad or happy) is a trigger. One of the biggest keys to quitting smoking is spotting the triggers that make you crave smoking and trying to avoid them.

How Hard Will It Be to Quit? Everyone is different, and how tough it will be for you depends on:
• How many cigarettes you smoke daily
• If your friends and family members smoke Focus on the benefits. Within hours of quitting, your body starts to recover from the effects of nicotine and additives. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature -- all of which are higher than they should be because of the nicotine in cigarettes -- return to healthier levels. You can breathe easier. Poisonous carbon monoxide in your blood drops, so your blood can carry more oxygen. No doubt about it: Quitting helps your entire body. It can even improve your looks: You'll be less likely to get wrinkles when you're still young. And you'll save money, too. How Can I Avoid Smoking Again? Slipping is a common part of quitting. For most people trying to quit, even “just one puff” counts. And if you “have just one,” it makes it that much harder to go completely smoke free. But slipping does not mean you go back to smoking regularly. Use your slip up to focus on your triggers and learn how to better deal with cravings. And to avoid further slip ups and relapses, try the following:
• If you live with a smoker, ask them not to smoke around you.
• When you get the urge to smoke, take a deep breath. Hold it for 10 seconds and release it slowly. Repeat this several times until the urge is gone.
• Keep your hands busy. Doodle, play with a pencil or straw, or work on a computer.
• Change activities that were connected to smoking. Take a walk or read a book instead of taking a cigarette break.
• Hang out with nonsmokers or go to places that don't allow smoking, such as the movies, museums, shops, or libraries.
• Exercise. Exercising will help you relax.
• Get support for quitting, especially from family and friends.
• Work with your doctor to develop a plan using over-the-counter or prescription nicotine replacement aids.

When you quit smoking, you will have both physical and mental withdrawals. You may crave cigarettes, feel irritable and hungry, cough often, get headaches, or have difficulty concentrating. You have these symptoms of withdrawal because your body is used to nicotine. When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first 2 weeks after quitting, stay in control. Think about your reasons for quitting. Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without nicotine. The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary. They are strongest when you first quit but will go away within 10 to 14 days. Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases that smoking can cause. You may still have the desire to smoke, since there are many strong associations with smoking. The best way to overcome these associations is to enjoy them without smoking. If you relapse and smoke again, don’t lose hope. Seventy-five percent of those who quit smoke again. Most smokers quit 3 or more times before they are successful. Plan ahead and think about what you will do the next time you get the urge to smoke.",0

354,"Diets low in saturated fat don't curb heart disease risk or help you live longer, says a leading US cardiovascular research scientist and doctor of pharmacy in an editorial in the open access journal Open Heart.

And current dietary advice to replace saturated fats with carbohydrates or omega 6-rich polyunsaturated fats is based on flawed and incomplete data from the 1950s, argues Dr James DiNicolantonio.

Dietary guidelines should be urgently reviewed and the vilification of saturated fats stopped to save lives, he insists.

DiNicolantonio points out that the demonization of saturated fats dates back to 1952, when research suggested a link between high dietary saturated fat intake and deaths from heart disease.

But the study author drew his conclusions on data from six countries, choosing to ignore the data from a further 16, which didn't fit with his hypothesis, and which subsequent analysis of all 22 countries' data, disproved, says DiNicolantonio.

Nevertheless, the bad boy image stuck, particularly after US President Eisenhower had a heart attack in his 50s, points out DiNicolantonio in an accompanying podcast.

And it prompted the belief that since these fats increase total cholesterol -- a flawed theory in itself, says DiNicolantonio -- they must also increase heart disease risk. And as foodstuffs with the highest calorie density, the thinking was that reduced intake would naturally curb obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

But the evidence, which continues to mount, suggests otherwise, he says.

There is now a strong argument in favour of the consumption of refined carbohydrates as the causative dietary factor behind the surge in obesity and diabetes in the US, he says.

And while a low fat diet may lower 'bad' (LDL) cholesterol, there are two types of LDL cholesterol. And switching to carbs may increase pattern B (small dense) LDL, which is more harmful to heart health than pattern A (large buoyant) LDL, as well as creating a more unfavourable overall lipid profile, he says.

Furthermore, several other studies indicate that a low carb diet is better for weight loss and lipid profile than a low fat diet, while large observational studies have not found any conclusive proof that a low fat diet cuts cardiovascular disease risk, he says.

But in the race to cut saturated fat intake, several dietary guidelines recommend upping polyunsaturated fat intake.

However, a recent analysis of published trial data shows that replacing saturated fats and trans fatty acids with omega 6 fatty acids, without a corresponding rise in omega 3 fatty acids, seems to increase the risk of death from coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases.

""We need a public health campaign as strong as the one we had in the 70s and 80s demonising saturated fats, to say that we got it wrong,"" urges DiNicolantonio in the podcast.

The best diet to boost and maintain heart health is one low in refined carbohydrates, sugars and processed foods, he recommends.

And anyone who has had a heart attack should not be thinking of replacing saturated fats with refined carbs or omega 6 fatty acids -- particularly those found in processed vegetable oils containing large amounts of corn or safflower oil, he says.",0

360,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0
361,"ROCHESTER, Minn. – Researchers at Mayo Clinic have identified a possible cause for a rare infection in heart and lung transplant recipients: the donor.

The way in which heart and lung transplant recipients acquired a specific species of bacteria, Mycoplasma hominis, had been previously undefined, and the bacterium was difficult to test. Originally, this bacterium was considered to reside exclusively in, and be a potential pathogen of, the area of the reproductive and urinary organs – the genitourinary tract.

“This finding could affect how we approach the evaluation of organ donors,” says Mark Wylam, M.D., who led the team of Mayo Clinic researchers on this study. “If potential transmission of these harmful bacteria can be identified and addressed, the recipient will face a decreased risk of infection and its serious complications. This study shows us that surveillance of both donor and recipient are important in recognizing M. hominis and the infection it can cause.”

Heart and lung transplant recipient infection caused by M. hominis may present with pleurisy (inflammation of membrane in chest cavity and lungs), surgical site infection and mediastinitis (inflammation of tissue in mid-chest). M. hominis resists most antibiotics, and the three antibiotic treatment recommendations for these infections are neither standard for post-transplant recipient care nor are they standard in therapy regimens for surgical site infections.

The study, published recently in EBioMedicine, investigates Mayo Clinic lung and heart-lung transplants between 1998 and July 2015. Seven previously unreported cases of transplant recipients with M. hominis infection were discovered. In each case, pre-transplant sputum cultures had tested negative for M. hominis. Also, a literature review since 1950 found 15 cases of M. hominis infection in lung, heart or heart-lung transplant recipients. The way the germ spread remained uncertain. Given its normal residence in the genitourinary tract, some speculated that infection arose from urinary catheter placement during the transplant surgery.

Mayo investigators noted two particular cases of M. hominis infection that each had received a single lung transplant from the same donor, and no other patients in the hospital were infected by M. hominis. The samples of the M. hominis taken from each infected individual were genetically indistinguishable, suggesting the infections had the same source. This finding, in addition to two other observations, supported the likelihood that M. hominis could be passed from transplant donor to recipient.

Common testing methods have proven insufficient in identifying the bacteria, but the use of polymerase chain reaction detection developed by Robin Patel, M.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory and chair of the Division of Clinical Microbiology, offers a more time-sensitive and specific test for the bacteria. With this method, researchers zoom in on a certain portion of DNA and then create multiple copies to amplify the segment. Polymerase chain reaction detection reduces the time to detect M. hominis to a few hours, compared to the two to five days needed for a culture media test.

“The true rate of M. hominis infection may actually be higher than what we’ve seen reported,” says Dr. Wylam. “Better detection methods like PCR tests have given us more insight into how common this bacterium is in the airway, which is especially important in heart or lung transplant recipients. More research is needed to learn about these bacteria when it’s found far from its natural home in the genitourinary tract, and especially when it is transmitted to cardiothoracic transplant recipients.”

364,"Biliopancreatic diversion surgery for morbid obesity is known to cause multiple vitamin deficiencies that may worsen during pregnancy. In the June issue of the Journal of AAPOS, the Official Publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, a group of Australian clinicians report a child who was born blind as a result of Vitamin A deficiency caused by his mother's obesity surgery.

Clinical investigators from Australia documented the case of a woman who had undergone biliopancreatic diversion surgery for obesity 7 years before the birth of her child. At 9 weeks gestation, the mother was diagnosed with severe deficiencies of Vitamins A, D and K, as well as iron-deficiency anemia, which had been undetected prior to this point. Despite treatment, her serum vitamin A level remained critically low throughout the pregnancy. Her infant son had significant malformations of both eyes, and his vision remains poor despite treatment. For the fetus, the first 8 weeks of gestation are the most critical time for organs to develop, including the formation of the visual system,

Lead investigator Glen Gole, MD, FRANZCO, Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Children's Hospital and Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, states, ""The mother's description of night blindness, recurrent low vitamin A levels during the pregnancy, and demonstrated vitamin A deficiency in the neonate support vitamin A deficiency as the cause. This case illustrates that vitamin A is very important for normal eye development in the fetus, particularly for pregnant women who have undergone gastric bypass surgery in order to improve their fertility.""

Commenting on the article, J AAPOS Editor-in-Chief David G. Hunter, MD, PhD, stated, ""Weight-reduction surgery is becoming more common, especially with the potential for health benefits that result from reducing obesity. Unfortunately some forms of this surgery cause vitamin deficiency, and in this case the problem led to a birth defect that caused blindness in one child. We are not aware of any other cases of this particular problem, but it is important for any woman who has had this form of gastric bypass surgery to be checked for vitamin deficiency--and have it corrected -- before considering having a baby.""",0
365,"Feb.2, 2023 – Add this to the list of social media’s potential health risks: unintended pregnancy.

That’s for women who take birth control advice from influencers, particularly on YouTube, where many talk about stopping hormonal contraception and may give incomplete or inaccurate sexual health information.

In an analysis of 50 YouTube videos, University of Delaware researchers found that nearly three-quarters of influencers talked about discontinuing birth control pills or other forms hormonal birth control. And 40% were using or had used a “natural family planning” method – when women track their cycle, sometimes using an app, to identify days they might get pregnant.

“We know from previous research that these non-hormonal options, such as fertility tracking apps, are not always as accurate as hormonal birth control,” says lead study author Emily Pfender, who reported her findings in the journal Health Communication. “They rely on so many different factors, like body temperature and cervical fluid, that vary widely.”

In fact, this “natural” approach only works when women meticulously follow guidelines like measuring basal body temperature and tracking cervical fluid daily. But many influencers left that part out. Using fertility-tracking methods without the right education and tools could raise the risk of unplanned pregnancy, as failure rates using these methods vary from 2% to 23%, according to the CDC.",0
366,"July 18, 2022 – Monkeypox cases are expected to continue to climb in the coming weeks, the CDC says.

This likely spike in cases is from increased testing for monkeypox that’s due to a more streamlined monkeypox case reporting system; more infections from monkeypox exposures; and a higher number of people seeking monkeypox tests, Rochelle Walensky, MD, the director of the CDC, said during a Friday media call.

Since July 6, monkeypox tests done at state public health labs have risen 76%, she said.

But officials are confident that U.S. testing will meet increasing need. Now, the country can test 70,000 samples per week, Walensky said. So far, capacity far exceeds testing demand.

As of July 15, there were 1,814 reported cases of monkeypox in the U.S. As of July 14, of 700 cases where demographic information was available, the median age of those infected was 36, and the “vast majority” of cases have been in men who have sex with men, Walensky said.",0
367,"Variants of viruses, such as that causing COVID-19, can now be quickly studied in the laboratory, even before they emerge in nature and become a major public health challenge.

The University of Queensland, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Monash University, and Queensland Health have developed a technology to manipulate viruses synthetically allowing rapid analysis and mapping of new potential virus variants.

UQ's lead researcher Professor Alexander Khromykh said the technology was ideal for use during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.

""This technique should give us the ability to answer questions about whether potential virus variants are susceptible to a particular drug or vaccine, even before they emerge in nature,"" Professor Khromykh said.

""Up until now, we've mostly just waited and reacted to viral variants as they emerge, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2 the world has been hit by Indian, UK and South African variants, just to name a few. [WHO has now re-classified these variants as Alpha (UK), Beta (South African) and Delta (Indian).]

""Now we can mimic the massive 'experiment' going on in nature -- where these mutations pop up due to natural selection -- but we can do it safely in a strictly controlled and highly regulated biosecurity laboratory environment.""

The UQ-developed process uses copies of fragments from the viral genetic material to assemble the functional viral genome in a test tube.

This allows scientists to rapidly generate virus variants and assess their potential to evade antiviral treatments and vaccine-induced immunity.

QIMR Berghofer helped to evaluate infection and disease caused by the 'test tube'-made virus in pre-clinical models to ensure the technology was able to generate authentic viruses.

Professor Andreas Suhrbier from QIMR Berghofer said the research was essential, as viruses were changing all the time.

""We can now monitor changes in viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and can see which variants may not respond to certain vaccines and anti-viral treatments.

""We can also investigate whether potential variants are more or less virulent in mice, and find out which drugs and vaccines will be effective.

""It's great to finally have this vital tool and start tackling these challenging questions.""

The research has been published in Nature Communications.

The study featured collaborations from research groups including Professor Daniel Watterson, Dr Jody Hobson-Peters, Professor Paul Young and Professor Roy Hall from UQ; Professor Jason Mackenzie's team at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity; Associate Professor Fasseli Coulibaly's team at Monash University; Frederick Moore and the team at Forensic and Scientific Services Public Health Virology at Queensland Health.",0
368,"Major intestinal surgery, including stomach reduction for obesity, may boost the chances of subsequent vitamin A deficiency, suggests a small study published ahead of print in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

The researchers base their findings on three patients with increasingly poor eyesight or night blindness, who attended a specialist eye clinic within the space of a year. None of the patients had a family or personal history of eye problems.

All three patients, who were all over the age of 65, had had extensive intestinal surgery between 20 and 35 years earlier.

The operations included intestinal bypass, surgical removal of diseased tissue as a result of inflammatory bowel disease, and gallbladder removal.

All the patients were diagnosed with vitamin A deficiency, and this was in spite of them having taken vitamin supplements.

One of the patients refused injections of vitamin A into the muscles. But the other two went ahead with this treatment, which prompted an improvement in their vision within days.

Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of childhood blindness in developing countries, and is caused by malnutrition. It is rare in affluent, developed countries, where it is mainly caused by poor absorption or abnormal metabolism.

A fat soluble vitamin, it is absorbed through the small intestine as either retinol or carotene, and stored in the liver for up two years and transported to tissues as needed.

Vitamin A is essential for the healthy working of the photosensitive pigment and superficial tissues of the eye. Night blindness is one of the most common symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.

The authors warn that the increasing popularity of gastric banding and gastric bypass, the surgical treatments for obesity, is making vitamin A deficiency increasingly common in the developed world.",0
369,"Pregnancy, long reproductive span, and older age at menopause are associated with a lower risk of dementia in women, according to a study publishing April 5 in the open access journal PLOS Medicine. Inversely, hysterectomy, younger age of first birth, and younger or older than average age at first period were associated with greater dementia risk. The study suggests that reproductive and hormonal factors may be involved in dementia risk, but observed a similar association between the number of children and dementia risk in women and men, suggesting that the physical experience of childbearing may not account for risk variation.

Dementia rates are increasing around the world, with some studies reporting a higher incidence in women than men, yet there is a limited evidence base on reproductive factors and the risk of dementia. Jessica Gong at The George Institute for Global Health, Australia, and colleagues used data from the UK Biobank to examine the risk of all cause dementia and reproductive factors in 273,240 women as well as the number of children in those women and in 228,965 men.

After controlling for age, socioeconomic status, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other elements, certain events related to shorter cumulative exposure to internally produced estrogen -- such as older than average age at first period, younger than average age at menopause, and having a hysterectomy -- were associated with higher dementia risk. Pregnancy, even aborted pregnancy, longer reproductive span, older age at menopause, and use of contraceptive pills were associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia. For both men and women, compared with having two children, having no children or four or more were apparently associated with greater risk of dementia.

The study has limitations including the retrospective reporting on reproductive factors that can be subject to bias, and the fact that UK Biobank is a relatively healthy cohort of affluent people of white British ancestry so may not be representative of a broader population.

Gong adds, ""Reproductive events related to shorter exposure to endogenous estrogen in women were associated with higher dementia risk, and these findings highlight the vulnerability in dementia risk pertaining to women. However, the similar association between the number of children and dementia risk observed for women and men indicates that the risk variation in women may be more related to social and behavioural factors in parenthood, rather than biological factors involved in childbearing.""",0

The study suggests a new potential target for treating Alzheimer's disease and encouraging the testing of various approaches. The researchers found that NR did not act on the brain by normalizing levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). No new strain of mice was developed, and the studies did not accurately mimic Alzheimer's disease in humans. Using this animal model, the researchers tested the effects of an NR supplement and found that mice who received NR showed reduced tau in their brains but no change in amyloid-beta. The NR-treated mice had less DNA damage, higher neuroplasticity, increased production of new neurons, and lower levels of neuronal damage. The NR-treated mice also performed better on memory tests but did not show improvements in muscular and grip strength, endurance, or gait. Next steps for the research team include further studies on the underlying mechanisms and preparations towards intervention in humans.

The effective rate could be as high as 61 percent when including the estate tax and taxing unrealized capital gains at death under President Biden's tax plan. However, taxpayers who have lower levels of wealth would not be subject to one or both of the estate tax and taxing unrealized capital gains at death. Only unrealized gains over $1 million ($2 million for joint filers) would be subject to that tax, and the estate tax kicks in over $11.7 million. The 61 percent effective tax rate would not apply to taxpayers writ-large.
The tax proposals under the House Ways & Means Committee (separate from the bipartisan infrastructure bill) did not include a tax on unrealized capital gains at death, which suggests that this proposal may not make it to the final package. The Senate Finance Committee has not yet released their own tax proposals, though, so it could still be included later on. If unrealized capital gains are not taxed, then only the current law estate tax would apply and the effective tax rate would be lower than 61 percent. Currently, the estate tax applies to estates over $11.7 million per person and at a 40% tax rate.

375,"Researchers at the University of East Anglia have helped develop a new blood test to detect prostate cancer with greater accuracy than current methods.

New research shows that the Prostate Screening EpiSwitch (PSE) blood test is 94 per cent accurate -- beating the currently used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.

The research team say that the new test shows significant potential as an accurate and rapid cancer screening diagnostic.

The test was developed by Oxford Biodynamics in collaboration with UEA, Imperial College London and Imperial College NHS Trust.

Prof Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and kills one man every 45 minutes in the UK.

""There is currently no single test for prostate cancer, but PSA blood tests are among the most used, alongside physical examinations, MRI scans and biopsies.

""However, PSA blood tests are not routinely used to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.

""Only about a quarter of people who have a prostate biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer.

""There has therefore been a drive to create a new blood test with greater accuracy.""

The UEA team evaluated the new PSE test, which combines the traditional PSA test with an epigenetic EpiSwitch test, in a pilot study involving 147 patients.

They compared its results with those of the standard PSA test -- and found that PSE significantly enhances overall detection accuracy for at-risk men.

Prof Pshezhetskiy said: ""When tested in the context of screening a population at risk, the PSE test yields a rapid and minimally invasive prostate cancer diagnosis with impressive performance. This suggests a real benefit for both diagnostic and screening purposes.""

Dr Jon Burrows, Chief Executive Officer at Oxford Biodynamics said: ""There is a clear need in everyday clinical practice for a highly accurate blood test that can screen men for prostate cancer and accurately identify those at risk, while sparing those who up to now would be subject to unnecessary, expensive and invasive procedures.

""This is another example of how our product portfolio can contribute to reducing the total cost of care for global health.""

376,"Elevated nonfasting triglyceride levels, previously associated with an increased risk for heart attack, also appear to be associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke, according to a new study.

Recent studies found a strong association between elevated levels of nonfasting triglycerides, which indicate the presence of remnant (a small portion that remains) lipoproteins, and increased risk of ischemic heart disease. ""It is therefore possible that nonfasting triglyceride levels are also associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke,"" the authors write. ""Triglyceride levels are usually measured after an 8- to 12-hour fast, thus excluding most remnant lipoproteins; however, except for a few hours before breakfast, most individuals are in the nonfasting state most of the time. Therefore, by mainly studying fasting rather than nonfasting triglyceride levels, several previous studies may have missed an association between triglycerides and ischemic stroke.""

Jacob J. Freiberg, M.D., of Copenhagen University Hospitals, Denmark, and colleagues conducted a study to determine if increased levels of nonfasting triglycerides are associated with risk of ischemic stroke. The Copenhagen City Heart Study, a Danish population–based study initiated in 1976 with follow-up through July 2007, included 13,956 men and women age 20 through 93 years. Participants had their nonfasting triglyceride levels measured at the beginning of the study and at follow-up examinations.

Of the 13,956 participants in the study, 1,529 developed ischemic stroke. The researchers found that the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke increased with increasing levels of nonfasting triglycerides. Men with elevated nonfasting triglyceride levels of 89 through 176 mg/dL had a 30 percent higher risk for ischemic stroke; for levels 177 through 265 mg/dL, there was a 60 percent increased risk; for 266 through 353 mg/dL, a 50 percent higher risk; for 354 through 442 mg/dL, a 2.2 times elevated risk; and for 443 mg/dL or greater, the risk of ischemic stroke was 2.5 times greater compared to men with nonfasting levels less than 89 mg/dL.

Corresponding values for women were a 30 percent increased risk of ischemic stroke for nonfasting triglyceride levels of 89 through 176 mg/dL; twice the risk for levels 177 through 265 mg/dL; a 40 percent higher risk for levels of 266 through 353 mg/dL; 2.5 times the risk for 354 through 442 mg/dL; and 3.8 times the risk for ischemic stroke for women with nonfasting triglyceride levels of 443 mg/dL or greater compared to women with nonfasting triglyceride levels less than 89 mg/dL.

Absolute 10-year risk of ischemic stroke ranged from 2.6 percent in men younger than 55 years with nonfasting triglyceride levels of less than 89 mg/dL to 16.7 percent in men age 55 years or older with levels of 443 mg/dL or greater. These values in women were 1.9 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. Men with a previous ischemic stroke vs. controls had nonfasting triglyceride levels of 191 mg/dL vs. 148 mg/dL; for women, these values were 167 mg/dL vs. 127 mg/dL.

""By using levels of nonfasting rather than fasting triglycerides and by having more statistical power than any previous study, we detected a previously unnoticed association between linear increases in levels of nonfasting triglycerides and stepwise increases in risk of ischemic stroke …"", the authors write. ""Even the most recent European and North American guidelines on stroke prevention do not recognize elevated triglyceride levels as a risk factor for stroke.""

""Our results, together with those from 2 previous studies, suggest that elevated levels of nonfasting triglycerides and remnant lipoprotein cholesterol could be considered together with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for prediction of cardiovascular risk. However, these findings require replication in other populations.""",0

379,"How can you mend a broken heart? According to researchers from Japan, in some cases gene replacement therapy just might do the trick.

In a study published in January in Stem Cell Reports, researchers from Osaka University report that heart cells from a patient with an inherited heart disease called arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy do not contract correctly when grown in the laboratory, and that replacing the mutated gene responsible for this effect fixes this defect.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy occurs due to mutations in genes involved in desmosomes, which form 'welds' between cells that help them communicate and move in a coordinated way. One of these genes, PKP2, encodes a protein known as plakophilin-2 that is crucial to maintaining heart cell structure.

""Previous studies carried out in cardiomyocytes have shown that mutations in PKP2 play a pathological role in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy,"" says lead author of the study Hiroyuki Inoue. ""However, the cells used in those experiments were derived from healthy individuals and were not assessed for contractile function.""

To investigate how cells derived from patients behave in the laboratory, the researchers first took a blood sample from a young patient with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, induced some of the blood cells to become stem cells, and then differentiated these stem cells into heart cells. They then modified this original batch of heart cells into three different cell lines with precisely adjusted PKP2 expression based on how many mutated or intact copies of the gene were present.

""The cells with two mutated copies of PKP2 clearly exhibited reduced contractility and impaired desmosome assembly due to plakophilin-2 deficiency,"" explains Shuichiro Higo, senior author. ""These effects were also observed in cells with only one mutated copy of PKP2, although they were less severe.""

Replacing the mutated PKP2 with an intact copy of the gene repaired the defects in both cell contraction and desmosome assembly, which the researchers were able to observe using a time-lapse approach and fluorescently labeled desmosomes.

""These findings suggest that our cardiomyocyte cell lines recapitulate the pathology of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and provide a rapid and convenient platform for developing gene-based therapies for this disease,"" says Higo.

Given that PKP2 is the most common gene associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and that PKP2 mutations can lead to severe disease, new therapeutic approaches could help halt disease progression. The findings from this study suggest that gene replacement therapy could be a valuable way of treating patients with this condition and the cell lines created in this study are a viable model to test new therapies for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy on.",0

381,"The University of Surrey has not disproven the idea that the leading cyclist in a group is most exposed to harmful vehicle pollutants. They did not conduct experiments in their Environmental Flow wind tunnel to capture results from a vehicle driving in front and adjacent to the riders. When there is a vehicle in front of the group and little wind movement, exposure to pollutants decreases the further back the cyclist is. With more wind, riding towards the back of the group minimizes exposure. When the vehicle is next to the cycling group, exhaust fumes can be trapped by an aerodynamic field, making the front position the least exposed. Joy Schmeer, a postgraduate researcher at the university, stressed that exposure to pollutants when cycling should not be ignored, especially if cycling is a regular mode of transport. Group cyclists should consider their position within the group to decrease exposure. Dr. Marco Placidi, a senior lecturer in experimental fluid mechanics at the university, recommends that cyclists distance themselves from a driving vehicle's exhaust, potentially from other riders if a vehicle is adjacent to the group, while drivers should maximize their distance from riders before overtaking them. The experiments illustrate the need to consider the effects of peak urban cycle lane utilization when designing them.",1
382,"Adding evidence to the importance of early development, a new study links neutral maternal behavior toward infants with an epigenetic change in children related to stress response.

Epigenetics are molecular processes independent of DNA that influence gene behavior. In this study, researchers found that neutral or awkward behavior of mothers with their babies at 12 months correlated with an epigenetic change called methylation, or the addition of methane and carbon molecules, on a gene called NR3C1 when the children were 7 years old. This gene has been associated with regulating the body's response to stress.

""There is evidence of a relationship between the quality of maternal-infant interaction and methylation of this gene though these are small effects in response to a relatively small variation in interaction,"" said Elizabeth Holdsworth, a Washington State University biological anthropologist and lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Human Biology.

Other studies have connected extreme stress in early life, like neglect and abuse, to more dramatic methylation on this particular gene in adults. However, Holdsworth emphasized that the small difference indicated by this study may be an indication of normal human variation and it's hard to determine if there are any long-term effects.

For this study, Holdsworth and her co-authors analyzed a subsample of 114 mother-infant pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a project that tracks a cohort of children born in 1991 and 1992 in Avon, UK.

The researchers first analyzed data from an observational study of the mothers sharing a picture book with their children at 12 months, in which their interactions were coded on warmth. The study focused on mothers because they are often infants' primary caregivers. The vast majority of the women in this sample were white, college-educated and from middle-income households. The range of warmth they displayed only varied slightly with the ""coldest"" behavior classified as awkward or neutral, but this is exactly what the researchers hoped to test: that if even small differences in social interaction could be linked to an epigenetic change.

The observed behavior was then compared against data from an epigenetic analysis of the children's blood samples taken at age seven. The researchers found that the mothers showing awkward or neutral behavior toward their infant correlated with a small increase of methylation on the NR3C1 gene. This gene encodes a receptor involved in the regulation of the HPA axis -- the interaction between the body's hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands. This axis plays a role in stress response, including production of the body's primary ""stress"" hormone, cortisol.

The HPA axis can be activated by almost anything that requires a quick release of energy from reacting to a real threat to watching a scary movie to simply exercising. The NR3C1 gene is known to be involved in activating this axis, but more research is needed to understand how methylation of that gene is associated with stress response, Holdsworth said, as some studies have shown increased methylation linked to hypo-reactivity, or blunted response while others have shown hyper-reactivity.

Researchers are working to uncover how these changes happen, particularly during infancy when the body is developing rapidly -- as well as what they might mean.

""Within developmental biology, we know humans grow to fit the environment that they're in, which contributes to normal human biological variation. It's not necessarily good or bad,"" she said.

In addition to Holdsworth, co-authors on this study include Lawrence Schell and Allison Appleton from University at Albany, State University of New York.

387,"Researchers have identified a compound that blocks the spread of pancreatic and other cancers in various animal models. When cancer spreads from one part of the body to another in a process called metastasis, it can eventually grow beyond the reach of effective therapies. Now, there is a new plan of attack against this deadly process, thanks to scientists at the National Institutes of Health, Northwestern University and their collaborative research partners.

The team collaborated to identify a compound, which they named metarrestin, that stopped tumor metastasis in multiple animal models. Mice treated with metarrestin also had fewer tumors and lived longer than mice that did not receive treatment. These results were published May 16, 2018 in Science Translational Medicine.

“Many drugs are aimed at stopping cancer growth and killing cancer cells,” said co-author Juan Marugan, Ph.D., group leader of the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Chemical Genomics Center. “However, there is no single approved drug specifically aimed at treating metastasis. Our results show metarrestin is a very promising agent that we should continue to investigate against metastasis.”

In patients, metarrestin potentially could be effective as a therapy after cancer surgery. Because advanced cancers are difficult to completely remove with surgery, doctors typically give chemotherapy to try to kill undetected cancer cells left behind and prevent the cancer from coming back. Metarrestin could be added to such standard drug therapy.

Metarrestin breaks down an incompletely understood component of cancer cells called the perinucleolar compartment (PNC). PNCs are found only in cancer cells, and in a higher number of cells in advanced cancer, when it has spread to other sites in the body.

Co-author Sui Huang, M.D., Ph.D., and her colleagues at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, showed early on that the more cancer cells with PNCs in a tumor, the more likely it would spread. Her findings suggested that reducing PNCs might translate to less cancer progression and possibly better outcomes in patients.

To test these ideas, Huang approached Marugan to tap into NCATS’ expertise in screening, chemistry, compound development and testing to evaluate more than 140,000 compounds for their potential effectiveness in eliminating PNCs in cells in advanced cancer.

While nearly 100 compounds initially showed some activity, the investigators identified one compound that could effectively break down PNCs in advanced prostate cancer cells. With the help of researchers at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, they modified the compound to make it work better as a potential drug and evaluated the effects of the molecule in different assays, or tests, in the laboratory. They found that metarrestin could block the way prostate and pancreatic cancer cells spread.

In collaboration with co-author Udo Rudloff, M.D., Ph.D., from NIH’s National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research, the group evaluated the effects — including toxicity — of metarrestin in pancreatic cancer mouse models. The investigators found that it prevented the further spread of pancreatic cancer by disrupting the protein-making machinery of cancer cells, and mice treated with metarrestin lived longer than mice without treatment.

“Cancer cells are rapidly dividing and need to make more proteins than healthy cells to help carry out various activities, including the ability to spread,” Rudloff said. “Interfering with the system stalls cancer cell metastasis.”

Rudloff and his NCI group currently are working with scientists at the NCATS-led Bridging Interventional Development Gaps program to collect the pre-clinical data on metarrestin needed to further its development as a candidate drug. The scientists plan to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the fall with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA IND approval is necessary before a candidate drug can be tested in patients.

The research was funded by NCATS and NCI through their intramural programs, and in addition, the National Human Genome Research Institute grant U54HG005031, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences grants R01GM078555 and R01GM115710, NCI grant 2 P30 CA060553-19, the V Foundation, a donation from the Baskes family to the Robert H.

389,"Older adults who took a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement with zinc and high amounts of vitamin C in a 12-week study experienced sickness for shorter periods and with less severe symptoms than counterparts in a control group receiving a placebo.

The findings by Oregon State University researchers were published in the journal Nutrients.

The research by scientists at OSU's Linus Pauling Institute involved 42 healthy people ages 55 to 75 and was designed to measure the supplement's effects on certain immune system indicators. It also looked at bloodstream levels of zinc and vitamins C and D while taking the supplement, as these micronutrients are important for proper immune function.

The immune indicators, including white blood cells' ability to kill incoming pathogens, were unaltered in the group receiving the supplement.

The multivitamin group showedimproved vitamin C and zinc status in the blood. Most intriguingly, illness symptoms reported by this group were less severe and went away faster than those experienced by the placebo group.

The same percentage of participants in each group reported symptoms, but days of sickness in the supplement group averaged fewer than three compared to more than six for the placebo group.

""The observed illness differences were striking,"" said corresponding author Adrian Gombart, professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the OSU College of Science and a principal investigator at the Linus Pauling Institute. ""While the study was limited to self-reported illness data and we did not design the study to answer this question, the observed differences suggest that additional larger studies designed for these outcomes are warranted -- and, frankly, overdue.""

As people get older, the risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that contribute to age-related immune system deficiencies rises. Across the United States, Canada and Europe, research suggests more than one-third of older adults are deficient in at least one micronutrient, often more than one.

""That likely contributes to a decline in the immune system, most often characterized by increased levels of inflammation, reduced innate immune function and reduced T-cell function,"" Gombart said. ""Since multiple nutrients support immune function, older adults often benefit from multivitamin and mineral supplements. These are readily available, inexpensive and generally regarded as safe.""

The multivitamin supplement used in the study focused on vitamins and minerals typically thought to help immunity. It contained 700 micrograms of vitamin A; 400 international units of vitamin D; 45 milligrams of vitamin E; 6.6 milligrams of vitamin B6; 400 micrograms of folate; 9.6 micrograms of vitamin B12; 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C; 5 milligrams of iron; 0.9 milligrams of copper; 10 milligrams of zinc; and 110 micrograms of selenium.

""Supplementation was associated with significantly increased circulating levels of zinc and vitamin C, and with illness symptoms that were less severe and shorter lasting,"" Gombart said. ""This supports findings that stretch back decades, even to the days of Linus Pauling's work with vitamin C. Our results suggest more and better designed research studies are needed to explore the positive role multivitamin and mineral supplementation might play in bolstering the immune system of older adults.""",0

Aug. 1, 2022 – A recall of protein supplement drinks announced earlier this month was expanded on Aug. 10 to include a number of popular organic, non-dairy beverages. Lyons Magnus announced the original voluntary recall on July 28 of various protein and beverage products over worries they may be contaminated with germs like Cronobacter sakazakii. The announcement identified 53 affected products, ranging from Oatly Oat Milk to Stumptown Cold Brew Coffee. The company expanded its recall list on Aug. 10 because some products may also be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum. Although that organism has not yet been found in any products, the company and the FDA warns consumers not to drink any of the recalled products even if they do not look or smell spoiled. The complete list of products, which also includes several products from Organic Valley, a popular brand sold in national grocery chains, is available on the FDA website, along with ways to tell if yours is part of the recall.

Alarms sounded after an analysis showed the products did not meet commercial sterilization standards, according to Lyons Magnus. The company then issued a recall. No illnesses have been reported. Cronobacter sakazakii is a foodborne germ. Contamination from the organism is especially harmful to babies and people who are immunocompromised, although anyone can be at risk. Cronobacter has been found in dry foods, like powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches, according to the CDC, “Cronobacter infection can also be very serious for older people and people whose bodies have trouble fighting germs, like people with HIV, organ transplants, or cancer.” While infection related to Cronobacter sakazakii is rare, anyone exposed to it can have fevers, vomiting, and urinary tract infections, according to the FDA. Only around two to four cases are reported to CDC annually, but the CDC says most states do not require reporting, and ""rates of Cronobacter infection in the United States are not well understood."" Clostridium botulinum may cause a severe form of food poisoning, the FDA says. It can begin from 6 hours to 2 weeks after eating food that contains the toxin. Symptoms may include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and muscle weakness. Botulism poisoning can cause respiratory paralysis, and can be deadly unless mechanical ventilation is provided.",0

395,"NIAID scientists identify cause, possible treatment for life-threatening gut condition

Investigators at the National Institutes of Health and international colleagues have discovered a genetic cause and potential treatment strategy for a rare immune disorder called CHAPLE disease. Children with the condition can experience severe gastrointestinal distress and deep vein blood clots. No effective treatments are available to ameliorate or prevent these life-threatening symptoms.

In the study, researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, describe a newly understood mechanism for CHAPLE disease, or CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy. The research report was published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine. CHAPLE disease is a form of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL), or Waldmann’s disease, first described in 1961 by Thomas A. Waldmann, M.D., an NIH Distinguished Investigator at the National Cancer Institute, at NIH.

“These findings are an example of how increasingly sophisticated techniques in genetics research inform our understanding of the immune system — especially our understanding of rare, inherited immune diseases,” said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID director.

Researchers analyzed genes from 11 children with CHAPLE disease and their families. They found that each child had two copies of a defective CD55 gene that prevented them from producing a cell surface protein of the same name. The CD55 protein helps regulate the immune system by blocking the activity of complement, a group of immune system proteins that can fight infections by punching holes in the cell membranes of bacteria and other infectious agents. However, complement also can damage the body’s tissues. The study authors found that in CHAPLE disease, uninhibited complement resulting from a lack of CD55 protein damaged blood and lymph vessels along the lower digestive tract, leading to the loss of protective immune proteins and blood cells. In many patients, this process caused a range of symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, problems absorbing nutrients, slow growth, swelling in the legs, recurrent lung infections, and blood clots.

After discovering that complement hyperactivity was driving these severe symptoms, researchers tested drugs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of other diseases to see if they block this process in samples of patient immune cells.

“People with CHAPLE disease lack CD55 protein and, with it, the ability to control complement activity,” said Michael Lenardo, M.D., chief of the Molecular Development of the Immune System Section of NIAID’s Laboratory of Immunology, and a lead author on the study. “The question is whether treating people with a substitute for CD55’s activity can help slow or reverse the symptoms of this disease.”

The authors found that complement production decreased when cells were exposed to eculizumab, a therapeutic antibody approved to treat another rare condition called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The NIAID team and their collaborators plan to study eculizumab in people with CHAPLE disease with the hope that the therapeutic could become the first effective treatment for the disorder.

397,"Sunscreen can reduce the sun's adverse effects, but there are concerns that it might inhibit the body's production of vitamin D. In a new British Journal of Dermatology study, however, investigators recorded an increase of vitamin D in participants during a week of cloudless weather, with very high UV index, even when sunscreens were used properly and prevented sunburn.

Sunlight contains UVA and UVB radiation, and the latter is essential for vitamin D synthesis. Two sunscreens with the same SPF were compared. Sunscreen with a high UVA protection factor enabled significantly higher vitamin D synthesis than a low UVA protection factor sunscreen, likely because it allows more UVB transmission.

The findings indicate that the benefits of sunscreen use can be obtained without compromising vitamin D levels.

""Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D. Sunscreens can prevent sunburn and skin cancer, but there has been a lot of uncertainty about the effects of sunscreens on vitamin D,"" said lead author Prof. Antony Young, of King's College London.

401,"Simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use, defined as using both substances at the same time so their effects overlap, increased in adults from 2008 to 2019, according to new research conducted at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Shifts in cannabis legislation have raised questions about unintended effects on cannabis and alcohol use patterns, whereby policy changes might lead people to use both substances. Until now, the relationships between recreational cannabis laws (RCLs) and changes in simultaneous cannabis/alcohol use prevalence had remain untested. The results are published online in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

""Our findings are concerning considering that simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use is associated with more negative consequences (e.g., risk behaviors [driving under the influence], heavy patterns of substance use, increased risk for alcohol use disorders) to the individual and society,"" said Priscilla Goncalves, PhD, a post-doctoral research fellow in Columbia Mailman School's Department of Epidemiology, and first author. ""Until this study, little had been known about the RCL and simultaneous use in adults in the U.S., where adult cannabis use and alcohol use are increasing in a changing cannabis policy environment.""

The researchers accessed restricted data from individuals aged 12+ from the 2008-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) covering 817,359 participants. Data included respondents' 2019 state of residence for state recreational cannabis law status. The final analysis included self-reporting of simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use.

From 2008 to 2019, the overall prevalence of simultaneous cannabis/alcohol use increased in adults. Comparing the period pre-RCL to post RCL, there were small but significant increases observed among those aged 21 and older. More specifically, the prevalence of simultaneous use among respondents aged 21-30 increased from 9.2 percent to 10.4 percent. Similarly, among participants aged 31-40 years and 41-50 years, prevalence increased from 5 percent to 6 percent and from 3 percent to 4.7 percent, respectively. However, for respondents aged 12-20 years old and 51 year-old and older, there were no significant associations between RCL and changes in the prevalence of simultaneous use.

""The greater availability and opportunity to access cannabis through legal supply chains available for adults ages 21 and over such as dispensaries, present in most RCL states, may explain why we observed increases in simultaneous cannabis/alcohol use in those aged 21-50 but not 12-20 years after RCLs in this sample.,"" noted Silvia Martins, MD, PhD, professor of epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School and senior author. ""These findings build upon prior research showing that states allowing dispensaries had a greater likelihood of alcohol-related outcomes in adults aged 21+. Our work confirms these findings and extends them by reporting rising simultaneous use after RCL with cannabis supply implementation using a nationally representative sample across age groups over a long period (2008-2019).

""Finally, our study contributes to the understanding of age group changes in simultaneous cannabis/ alcohol use after the legalization of adult cannabis use in the U.S. beyond medical laws"" says Gonçalves. ""Therefore, there may be a need to develop strategies to reduce harms related to simultaneous cannabis/alcohol use in adults aged 21-50.""

It is the first proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the potential clinical utility of amniotic fluid cells RNA-sequencing in the literature. The ground-breaking findings have been published in the academic journal, npj Genomic Medicine.

Rare diseases are usually genetic in origin. Although individually rare, collectively rare diseases were found to be 1 in 67 in the Hong Kong population, based on the team's previous study.The identification of genetic cause in rare diseases can provide accurate counselling for better clinical management and future pregnancy planning, which is essential to support the patients. Current technologies for prenatal diagnosis are largely DNA-based, with a large proportion (60-70%) remains undiagnosed, leading to clinical uncertainty and parental anxiety. Recently, RNA-sequencing has been found to increase diagnostic yield by 10% to 36%, however, none of these studies focused on prenatal diagnosis. In addition, in spite of the availability of well-established large database cataloging the gene expression profile of different tissues for adult, similar publicly-available dataset for amniotic fluid cells reflecting the embryological and fetal stage is lacking. Further study and research on RNA-sequencing in prenatal setting is thus necessary.

The research team demonstrated the potential clinical utility of amniotic fluid cells RNA-sequencing. A baseline for gene expression profile of amniotic fluid cells is established by performing RNA-sequencing on over 50 amniotic fluid samples. Establishment of gene expression profile is an essential step in applying RNA-sequencing to the current selected clinical diagnosis workflow. They found that the number of well-expressed genes in amniotic fluid cells was comparable to other clinically accessible tissues commonly used for genetic diagnosis across different disease categories. The research team also compared RNA-sequencing data of four affected fetuses with structural congenital anomalies with the established baseline to detect potential outliers. In collaboration with the Technical University of Munich in Germany, a bioinformatics pipeline was adapted to enhance the detection of outliers for subsequent analysis. Further in-depth curation showed that outliers can be identified in genes associated with the corresponding structural congenital anomalies in all four affected fetuses. Identifying the outliers provide more evidence at the RNA level to help diagnosis.

The findings of this study have significant implications in solving undiagnosed rare diseases in Hong Kong. It is the first time that amniotic fluid cells RNA-sequencing is reported to provide potential clinical utility in prenatal diagnosis in literature. With the identification of the genetic cause, precision medicine such as tailored clinical management and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for families with family history is possible.

403,"Researchers say less than 1 percent of people with obesity get back to a healthy body weight. Experts say new approaches are needed to fight this common ailment. For every 100 people who have obesity, only perhaps one will reach a healthy weight again, a new study states. Since obesity is directly linked to a higher incidence of disease and a shorter lifespan, that’s a big problem. Researchers with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the United Kingdom used a decade’s worth of digital health records for 278,982 people — 129,194 men and 149,788 women — and concluded current methods of getting people to lose weight aren’t working. The study, published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health, highlights the real world outcomes for adults with obesity in developed countries. In the United States, almost 35 percent of adults and 17 percent of children — or more than 91 million people — have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Obesity is defined as when a person’s body mass index, or BMI, is greater than 30. Researchers used only data from patients with at least three BMI measurements between 2004 and 2014. They found the odds of losing weight directly correlated with how much weight a person carried. Read More: Better Late Than Never, Doctors Begin to Treat Obesity »

Researchers said the overall chances of a man with obesity obtaining a normal body weight were 1 in 210. For women, it was 1 in 124. Men with a BMI over 40 had a 1 in 1,290 chance of becoming healthy while women in that category had a 1 in 677 chance. Losing 5 percent of their weight was successful for about 10 percent of women and 1 in 12 men. “Once an adult becomes obese, it is very unlikely that they will return to a healthy body weight,” Alison Fildes, Ph.D., first author of the study from the Division of Health and Social Care Research at King’s College London, said in a press release. Keeping the weight off is an even more difficult battle. About 53 percent of patients regained lost weight within two years and 78 percent put the weight back on within five years. A third of all patients had fluctuating weight, signifying many battles were lost and won before any kind of victory could be achieved. “Losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight has been shown to have meaningful health benefits and is often recommended as a weight loss target,” said Fildes. “These findings highlight how difficult it is for people with obesity to achieve and maintain even small amounts of weight loss.” Earlier this year, researchers published arguing that when the body gets accustomed to a certain weight, exercise and calorie restrictions send it into survival mode. This biological underpinning, evolved to prevent starvation, must be overridden with other methods. Experts: Obesity Is Biologically ‘Stamped In,’ Diet and Exercise Won’t Cure It »",0

406,"More than two billion people worldwide suffer from micronutrient malnutrition due to deficiencies in minerals and vitamins. Poor people in developing countries are most affected, as their diets are typically dominated by starchy staple foods, which are inexpensive sources of calories but contain low amounts of micronutrients. In a new Perspective article, an international team of scientists, involving the University of Göttingen, explains how plant genetic engineering can help to sustainably address micronutrient malnutrition. The article was published in Nature Communications.

Micronutrient malnutrition leads to severe health problems. For instance, vitamin A and zinc deficiency are leading risk factors for child mortality. Iron and folate deficiency contribute to anemia and physical and cognitive development problems. Often, the people affected are not aware of their nutritional deficiencies, which is why the term 'hidden hunger' is also used. The long-term goal is that all people are aware of healthy nutrition and have sufficient income to afford a balanced diet all year round. However, more targeted interventions are required in the short and medium term.

One intervention is to breed staple food crops for higher micronutrient contents, also known as 'biofortification'. Over the last 20 years, international agricultural research centres have developed biofortified crops using conventional breeding methods, including sweet potato and maize with vitamin A, as well as wheat and rice with higher zinc content. These crops were successfully released in various developing countries with proven nutrition and health benefits. However, conventional breeding approaches have certain limitations.

In the Perspective article, the scientists report how genetic engineering can help to further enhance the benefits of biofortified crops. ""Transgenic approaches allow us to achieve much higher micronutrient levels in crops than conventional methods alone, thus increasing the nutritional efficacy. We demonstrated this for folates in rice and potatoes,"" says Professor Dominique Van Der Straeten from Ghent University, the article's lead author. ""We also managed to reduce post-harvest vitamin losses significantly,"" she adds.

Another advantage of genetic engineering is that high amounts of several micronutrients can be combined in the same crop. ""This is very important, as poor people often suffer from multiple micronutrient deficiencies,"" says co-lead author and 2016 World Food Prize Laureate Dr Howarth Bouis from the International Food Policy Research Institute.

Genetic engineering can also help to combine micronutrient traits with productivity-enhancing agronomic traits, such as drought tolerance and pest resistance, which are becoming ever more relevant with climate change. ""Farmers should not have to make difficult choices between crops that either improve nutrition or allow productive and stable harvests. They need both aspects combined, which will also support widespread adoption,"" says co-author Professor Matin Qaim from the University of Göttingen.

The authors acknowledge that genetic engineering is viewed skeptically by many, despite the fact that the resulting crops have been shown to be safe for human consumption and the environment. One of the reasons for the public's reservations is that genetic engineering is often associated with large multinational companies. ""Biofortified crops may possibly reduce some of the concerns, as these crops are developed for humanitarian purposes,"" state the authors. ""Public funding is key to broader acceptance.""",0
407,"NIH names Rick Woychik director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences

Woychik will lead NIH’s research efforts on environmental influences on human health and also serve as director of the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., has appointed Richard (Rick) P. Woychik, Ph.D., as director of NIH’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Dr. Woychik served as acting director of the NIEHS since October 2019 and officially began his new role as the NIEHS director on June 7, 2020. NIEHS conducts and supports environmental health sciences in alignment with real-world public health needs and translates scientific findings into knowledge that can inform real-life individual and public health outcomes.

“Innovation has been a hallmark of Rick’s scientific career and it’s at the center of his vision for leading NIEHS,” said Dr. Collins. “He will be working to support new technologies and scientific approaches throughout the field of environmental health sciences – applying his proven skills in scientific excellence, creativity, and rigor to improving public health.”

Woychik is highly respected for a long list of accomplishments in mammalian genetics and environmental epigenetics. His laboratory was the first to identify a gene associated with polycystic kidney disease, the first to connect a protocadherin gene ultimately linked to hearing loss in Cushing’s disease patients, and the first to clone an obesity-related gene called agouti. Dr. Woychik says his passion for epigenetics and environmental health sciences started when his research group discovered that the obesity trait associated with one of the agouti mutant mouse lines was influenced by the epigenome during embryonic development.

“Individuals, with their unique biological make-up, respond to the environment in different ways. Our current research strategies mostly employ a ‘one size fits all’ approach that does not factor in this critically important variable,” Dr. Woychik explained. “My vision is to deal with the individual genetic, epigenetic and biological variability in the establishment of research strategies for studying public health and environmental toxicology.”

Addressing environmental and genetic factors that contribute to health of the individual is generally referred to as precision medicine. This is a major focus at NIH, especially through the All of Us Research Program. Dr. Woychik will work closely with the All of Us leadership to contribute NIEHS research on environmental exposures toward this landmark program.

Dr. Woychik earned his Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1984 from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He moved into the field of molecular genetics during his postdoctoral training in Philip Leder’s laboratory in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, Boston.

Woychik initially joined NIEHS in 2010 as deputy director. He successfully led the institute’s strategic planning exercises and guided implementation of the plans across a broad range of scientific disciplines. While his own expertise is as a basic scientist conducting genetic and epigenetic experiments to study the influence of the environment, as deputy director and acting director of the institute he interacted with investigators conducting a broad range of environmental health science research. With this experience, he brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge relating to the many disciplines of science that are necessary to lead environmental health science research. Prior to NIEHS, Woychik served nearly 10 years as the President and CEO of The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, where he oversaw seven major building projects in Maine and California, enhanced the organization’s focus on basic mechanistic research in model organisms with a focus on translation to human health and disease, established the Genetics Resource Science division, and oversaw a major realignment of the nonprofit business unit to substantially improve efficiency and outreach to the global biomedical community.

“I’ve always conducted my research in a highly collaborative manner, and I’ve reached out to investigators with expertise different and complementary to my own,” Dr. Woychik said. “This is a paradigm that I have also embraced as a science administrator and I plan to do the same as director of NIEHS.”

As NIEHS director, Woychik also inherits the additional responsibility as director of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The NTP is a federal, inter-agency program that reports directly into the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Three federal agencies comprise NTP including NIEHS, the National Center for Toxicological Research, part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

408,"Sept. 23, 2022 -- Vaccine boosters, as well as breakthrough infections after vaccination, provide substantial immunity against COVID-19, according to a new study published in the journal Med. In particular, the immune response increased significantly against severe disease, even in ages 65 and older, which could signal a shift in the pandemic, the authors wrote. “Early in the pandemic, we had very high mortality in certain vulnerable groups, such as older adults in nursing homes, but that reality is slowly changing,” Marcel Curlin, MD, a co-senior author and associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said in a statement. “Our study bolsters the idea that vaccination is a pathway to a milder illness,” he said. “Even if you’re older, your chances of having a severe illness if you’re re-infected down the line appears to be much lower than it was at the start of the pandemic.” The research team analyzed blood samples from 99 OHSU employees after vaccination, including some breakthrough cases. They looked at different aspects of the immune response, such as neutralizing antibodies and those that target the spike protein on the coronavirus.

Overall, the researchers found a similar increase in magnitude, potency, and breadth of the immune response among those whose blood was drawn three months after a third booster dose and those whose blood was drawn a month after a breakthrough infection. The immune response was also strong against the BA.2 Omicron variant, which was circulating at the time of the study. Researchers said they expect an even more robust immune response among people who receive the new bivalent COVID-19 vaccine this fall that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. “We anticipate that updated vaccine strategies with variant-specific regimens will significantly improve the breadth of the immune response and provide better protections against the SARS-CoV-2 variants,” Fikadu Tafesse, a co-senior author and associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at OHSU, said in the statement. In contrast to the beginning of the pandemic, the coronavirus is no longer “novel” to the human immune system, study authors said. Most people in the world have now been vaccinated, infected, or both, which means people have a more effective immune response than before.

Results from this study likely reflect the idea that the virus is evolving to become more transmissible but may be less harmful, Curlin said. “Boosters and natural infection substantially boost immune responses,” study authors concluded. “As the number of Omicron subvariant cases rise and as global vaccination and booster campaigns continue, an increasing proportion of the world’s population will acquire potent immune responses that may be protective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.”",0
409,"June 30, 2022 – As if cats weren’t already mysterious enough, questions have now resurfaced about animal-to-human transmission of the coronavirus after a report that a veterinary surgeon in Thailand likely got COVID-19 from a cat she was swabbing. Nature reports the case is the first evidence of cat-to-human COVID-19 transmission, though early in the pandemic cats were found to give COVID to other cats, and there have been various reports of the virus passing between animals and humans, not the least among them the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 jumped from bats to humans. According to a CDC report in Emerging Infectious Diseases, published online earlier this month, “a veterinarian in Thailand was diagnosed with COVID-19 after being sneezed on by an infected cat owned by an infected patient. Genetic study supported the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the owner to the cat, and then from the cat to the veterinarian.” So should people worry they could get COVID from their cat or other pets? The odds are very low, Jane Sykes, PhD, professor of small animal internal medicine at University of California Davis says.. It’s much more likely a human will give a pet COVID-19 than vice versa, she says. Additionally, cats shed viable virus for only a short time (about 5 days), according to the CDC. “Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is rare. This is what happened with SARS-CoV-2, which likely originated in bats,” the CDC says. Sykes says it’s very difficult to prove whether a cat has infected a human because of the common time lag of people knowing they have COVID-19 and the difficulty in separating the interactions of people inside and outside a household with interactions of household members and the family pet. Cat-to-human transmission may have happened before, she says, but it just hasn’t been proven as such. In any case, she says, “Companion animals are not important drivers of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.” In the Thailand case, the discovery of cat-to-human transmission came about by accident, according to the Nature the article.

Last August, a father and son who had tested positive for coronavirus were moved to an isolation ward in a hospital in southern Thailand. Their cat was also swabbed and tested positive. According to the report, “While being swabbed, the cat sneezed in the face of a veterinary surgeon, who was wearing a mask and gloves but no eye protection. Three days later, the vet developed a fever, sniffles and a cough, and later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but none of her close contacts developed COVID-19, suggesting that she had been infected by the cat. Genetic analysis also confirmed that the vet was infected with the same variant as the cat and its owners, and the viral genomic sequences were identical. Even though transmission is rare, precautions are wise, the CDC says, advising, “People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals.” If a pet infection is suspected, “Eye protection as part of the standard personal protection is advisable for caregivers during close interactions,” the CDC says. Earlier this year, WebMD reported that scientists have found the coronavirus in 29 kinds of animals, including household pets, livestock, and wildlife. One research team in 2020 found a possible case of cat to human transmission, but it was difficult to confirm. In most cases, humans infect animals, and animals don’t infect humans. But scientists have been concerned about recent research that shows some animals other than household companions -- such as mink and deer -- appear to be able to spread the virus to humans. According to a study published on the preprint server bioRxiv, researchers have found the “first evidence of a highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer and of deer-to-human transmission.” Experts last fall felt the concern was high enough to warrant a warning to deer hunters to wear mask and gloves when handling the animals. Nature also reported in February of this year that hamsters “probably carried the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 into Hong Kong and sparked a human COVID-19 outbreak,” according to a genomic analysis of samples from the hamsters.",0

412,"Benefits of fetal surgery to repair spina bifida persist through school age

Children as young as 6 years old who underwent fetal surgery to repair a common birth defect of the spine are more likely to walk independently and have fewer follow-up surgeries, compared to those who had traditional corrective surgery after birth, according to researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study appears in Pediatrics.

The procedure corrects myelomeningocele, the most serious form of spina bifida, a condition in which the spinal column fails to close around the spinal cord. With myelomeningocele, the spinal cord protrudes through an opening in the spine and may block the flow of spinal fluid and pull the brain into the base of the skull, a condition known as hindbrain herniation. In 2011, the Management of Myelomeningocele study, funded by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), found that by 12 months of age, children who had fetal surgery required fewer surgical procedures to divert, or shunt, fluid away from the brain. By 30 months, the fetal surgery group was more likely to walk without crutches or other devices.

For the current study, NICHD-funded researchers re-evaluated children from the original trial when they were 6 to 10 years old. Of the 161 children who took part in the follow-up study, 79 had been assigned to prenatal surgery and 82 had been assigned to traditional surgery. Children in the prenatal surgery group walked independently more often than those in the traditional surgery group (93% vs. 80%). Those in the prenatal surgery group also had fewer shunt placements for hydrocephalus, or fluid buildup in the brain (49% vs. 85%), and fewer shunt replacements (47% vs. 70%). The group also scored higher on a measure of motor skills.

The two groups did not differ significantly in a test measuring communication ability, daily living skills, and social interaction skills.

“Prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele carries benefits and risks, compared to traditional postnatal surgery,” said Menachem Miodovnik, M.D., of the NICHD Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch. “This study provides important information for physicians with patients who are considering prenatal surgery.”

The study was conducted by Amy Houtrow, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues.

418,"Cambridge scientists have shown that it is possible to spot signs of brain impairment in patients as early as nine years before they receive a diagnosis for one of a number of dementia-related diseases.

In research published today in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, the team analysed data from the UK Biobank and found impairment in several areas, such as problem solving and number recall, across a range of conditions.

The findings raise the possibility that in the future, at-risk patients could be screened to help select those who would benefit from interventions to reduce their risk of developing one of the conditions, or to help identify patients suitable for recruitment to clinical trials for new treatments.

There are currently very few effective treatments for dementia or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In part, this is because these conditions are often only diagnosed once symptoms appear, whereas the underlying neurodegeneration may have begun years -- even decades -- earlier. This means that by the time patients take part in clinical trials, it may already be too late in the disease process to alter its course.

Until now, it has been unclear whether it might be possible to detect changes in brain function before the onset of symptoms. To help answer this question, researchers at the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust turned to UK Biobank, a biomedical database and research resource containing anonymised genetic, lifestyle and health information from half a million UK participants aged 40-69.

As well as collecting information on participants' health and disease diagnoses, UK Biobank collected data from a battery of tests including problem solving, memory, reaction times and grip strength, as well as data on weight loss and gain and on the number of falls. This allowed them to look back to see whether any signs were present at baseline -- that is, when measurements were first collected from participants (between five and nine years prior to diagnosis).

People who went on to develop Alzheimer's disease scored more poorly compared to healthy individuals when it came to problem solving tasks, reaction times, remembering lists of numbers, prospective memory (our ability to remember to do something later on) and pair matching. This was also the case for people who developed a rarer form of dementia known as frontotemporal dementia.

People who went on to develop Alzheimer's were more likely than healthy adults to have had a fall in the previous 12 months. Those patients who went on to develop a rare neurological condition known as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which affects balance, were more than twice as likely as healthy individuals to have had a fall.

For every condition studied -- including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies -- patients reported poorer overall health at baseline.

First author Nol Swaddiwudhipong, a junior doctor at the University of Cambridge, said: ""When we looked back at patients' histories, it became clear that they were showing some cognitive impairment several years before their symptoms became obvious enough to prompt a diagnosis. The impairments were often subtle, but across a number of aspects of cognition.

""This is a step towards us being able to screen people who are at greatest risk -- for example, people over 50 or those who have high blood pressure or do not do enough exercise -- and intervene at an earlier stage to help them reduce their risk.""

Senior author Dr Tim Rittman from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge added: ""People should not be unduly worried if, for example, they are not good at recalling numbers. Even some healthy individuals will naturally score better or worse than their peers. But we would encourage anyone who has any concerns or notices that their memory or recall is getting worse to speak to their GP.""

Dr Rittman said the findings could also help identify people who can participate in clinical trials for potential new treatments. ""The problem with clinical trials is that by necessity they often recruit patients with a diagnosis, but we know that by this point they are already some way down the road and their condition cannot be stopped. If we can find these individuals early enough, we'll have a better chance of seeing if the drugs are effective.""

In December, the CDC warned that cases of invasive Strep A were on the rise. The World Health Organization reported a surge of infections in several cases. United Kingdom officials reported almost three times as many infections in late 2022 than over the previous five years.

Early on in the pandemic health officials began to encourage people to take vitamin D, as it plays a role in promoting immune response and could protect against COVID-19.

In a study published in the journal PLOS ONE researchers from the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University in Safed, Israel and the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, Israel show a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity and mortality.

The study is among the first to analyze vitamin D levels prior to infection, which facilitates a more accurate assessment than during hospitalization, when levels may be lower secondary to the viral illness.

The records of 1,176 patients admitted between April 2020 and February 2021 to the Galilee Medical Center (GMC) with positive PCR tests were searched for vitamin D levels measured two weeks to two years prior to infection.

Patients with vitamin D deficiency (less than 20 ng/mL) were 14 times more likely to have severe or critical case of COVID than those with more than 40 ng/mL.

Strikingly, mortality among patients with sufficient vitamin D levels was 2.3%, in contrast to 25.6% in the vitamin D deficient group.

The study adjusted for age, gender, season (summer/winter), chronic diseases, and found similar results across the board highlighting that low vitamin D level contributes significantly to disease severity and mortality.

""Our results suggest that it is advisable to maintain normal levels of vitamin D. This will be beneficial to those who contract the virus,"" says Dr. Amiel Dror, of the Galilee Medical Center and Azrieli Faculty of Medicine of Bar-Ilan University, who led the study.

429,"Researchers at the University of East Anglia have made an important discovery about how prostate cancer may start to develop.

A new study published today reveals that the prostate as a whole, including cells that appear normal, is different in men with prostate cancer.

It suggests that tissue cells throughout the whole prostate are primed and ready to develop prostate cancer.

This means that it may be better to treat the whole prostate rather than only the areas in the prostate that have cancer.

The team hope their work could help scientists better understand the causes of prostate cancer, and even prevent it altogether.

Lead researcher Prof Daniel Brewer, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and kills one man every 45 minutes in the UK.

""Often, when men are diagnosed with prostate cancer, groups of cancer cells can be found in more than one location within the prostate.

""We wanted to know if this is because of changes in 'normal' prostate cells throughout the prostate.""

Cancer is driven by changes in DNA, the genetic code of life, that appear in every cell. The team studied the DNA code in 121 tissue samples from 37 men with and without prostate cancer.

Prof Brewer said: ""The samples we studied included tissue that comes from the cancer and tissue from elsewhere in the prostate, which looks normal down the microscope.

""This produces a massive amount of data and by applying a large amount of computer power we can determine the differences that have occurred in the DNA, giving us insight into how the cancer grows.

""We found that 'normal' prostate cells in men who had prostate cancer had more mutations (changes in the DNA) than 'normal' prostate cells from men without prostate cancer.

""Based on the genetics of the samples analysed, we created maps to understand where the different mutations occurred. And we showed that in most men, the mutations in normal cells are different to mutations in cancer cells.

""The 'normal' prostate cells in men who have prostate cancer appear to provide a beneficial environment for prostate cancer cells to develop and grow.

""In other words, the whole prostate is primed and ready to develop prostate cancer driven by an, as yet unknown, biological process.

""This work has improved our knowledge of how prostate cancer first starts to develop and might one day give us clues as to how to prevent or treat it.

""And it shows that it may be better to treat the whole prostate rather than only the areas in the prostate that have cancer,"" he added.

Dr Hayley Luxton, Senior Research Impact Manager at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""This exciting new research shows for the first time how normal cells in the prostate can facilitate the growth and spread of prostate cancer.

""The researchers found that normal prostate cells in men with prostate cancer have specific genetic changes that make them act like a rich compost, providing the perfect environment for prostate cancer cells to grow and develop. These findings give us important new insights into the early development of prostate cancer, which might one day give us clues as to how to prevent it.""

430,"Emerging parasitic disease mimics the symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis in people

A new study published this week online in Emerging Infectious Diseases suggests that transmission of a protozoan parasite from insects may also cause leishmaniasis-like symptoms in people. The parasite, however, does not respond to treatment with standard leishmaniasis drugs. The research was conducted by scientists at the Federal Universities of Sergipe and São Carlos, the University of São Paulo, and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, all in Brazil, along with investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease and is often transmitted by the bite of some sand flies. The most common forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous, which causes skin sores, and visceral, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow). According to the World Health Organization, each year between 50,000 and 90,000 people become sick with visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a form of the disease that attacks the internal organs and is fatal in more than 95 percent of cases left untreated. During the last several decades, researchers have described rare cases of patients co-infected with both Leishmania and other groups of protozoan parasites that usually infect insects, including Crithidia. The current study of parasites isolated from a Brazilian patient confirms that Crithidia parasites also can infect people.

The 63-year-old patient initially sought treatment for the symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis, including weight loss, fever, anemia, and an enlarged liver and spleen. However, after eight months of standard leishmaniasis treatment, the patient’s symptoms had not improved. The patient developed widespread skin lesions with poorly defined edges (unlike the small lesions with well-defined edges that sometimes appear after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis) and ultimately died.

To determine the cause of disease, researchers cultured parasites taken from the patient’s bone marrow and skin lesions, sequenced their genomes, and discovered that the parasites were not closely related to known disease-causing Leishmania parasites. Instead, they were more closely related to Crithidia fasciculata, a parasite that usually colonizes mosquitoes. To confirm that these Crithidia parasites could infect mammals, the researchers exposed mice to the parasites isolated from the patient, both intravenously and by injection into the skin, and found that both types of parasite infected the liver. The parasites collected from the patient’s skin also caused skin lesions in the mice.

The study raises concerns that the Brazilian patient might not be an isolated case. If Crithidia infections represent an emerging infectious disease in people, there will be an urgent need to develop novel effective treatments, the researchers write. They expressed concern that the disease may be mosquito-borne because Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes can host the Crithidia parasite. More research will be needed to find other human cases, confirm the parasite’s range and host species, and discover potential treatments, the authors note.

432,"Vitamin D deficiency from birth to early childhood was associated with an increased risk of elevated blood pressure in later childhood and adolescence, according to new research in the American Heart Association journal Hypertension.

Researchers followed 775 children from birth to age 18 at the Boston Medical Center. Most lived in a low-income, urban area and 68% of the children were African American. Low vitamin D levels were defined as less than 11 ng/ml (nanograms per millimeter) in cord blood at birth and less than 25 ng/ml in a child's blood during early childhood.

Compared to children who were born with adequate vitamin D levels:
• Children born with low levels of vitamin D had an approximately 60% higher risk of elevated systolic blood pressure between ages 6 and 18;
• Children who had persistently low levels of vitamin D through early childhood had double the risk of elevated systolic blood pressure between ages 3 and 18.
• Systolic refers to the first or top number in a blood pressure reading. It indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when your heart beats. High systolic blood pressure readings increase the risk of cardiovascular disease even when diastolic blood pressure, the second number in a blood pressure reading, is controlled.

""Currently, there are no recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics to screen all pregnant women and young children for vitamin D levels. Our findings raise the possibility that screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency with supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood might be an effective approach to reduce high blood pressure later in life,"" said Guoying Wang, M.D., Ph.D., the study's lead author and an assistant scientist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.

Wang added that what constitutes optimal circulating vitamin D levels during pregnancy and early childhood remains an active research question, and that their study results need to be replicated in other large populations.

Vitamin D is needed for the body to absorb calcium for strong bones. It is made by our bodies when we are exposed to sunlight and found in a few foods, such as eggs, salmon and fortified milk products. It is also available as a vitamin supplement.

High blood pressure is a leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. Along with an increase in obesity among children, the prevalence of high blood pressure in children has been on the rise in recent years, especially among African American children. High blood pressure in childhood is an important risk factor for having high blood pressure and developing cardiovascular disease in adulthood.",0
433,"A study led by a UCL researcher suggests that using results from two blood markers, PSA and hK2, can improve the accuracy of screening for prostate cancer. The current best first-line test for prostate cancer is reliable and accurate but has a higher risk of false positives. By setting a risk threshold, the approach could reduce the number of false positives by three quarters while catching the same proportion of cancers. The approach is not innovative for cancer and should not be used to screen people based on their overall risk. The addition of the hK2 marker in prostate cancer screening yields a more accurate test when combined with PSA. All men who were estimated to have a 1 in 20 or greater risk of developing prostate cancer in the next five years were counted as ""screen positive."" Screening men aged 55 and over at least five yearly using this risk cut-off would not be effective in detecting 90% of cancer cases and would result in more than 1.2% of cases being false positives. In comparison, if a PSA test had been used alone, an 86% detection rate would have been accompanied by a false positive rate of 2%, while the risk-based approach had a false positive rate of 0.5%.

435,"Artificial pancreas effectively controls type 1 diabetes in children age 6 and up

A clinical trial at four pediatric diabetes centers in the United States has found that a new artificial pancreas system — which automatically monitors and regulates blood glucose levels — is safe and effective at managing blood glucose levels in children as young as age six with type 1 diabetes. The trial was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health. Results from the trial were published August 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“Fewer than 1 in 5 children with type 1 diabetes are able to successfully keep their blood glucose in a healthy range with current treatment, which may have serious consequences on their long-term health and quality of life,” said Guillermo Arreaza-Rubín, M.D., director of NIDDK’s Diabetes Technology Program and project scientist for the study. “Earlier research showed that the system tested in this study was safe and effective for people ages 14 and older. This trial now shows us this system works in a real-world setting with younger children.”

The artificial pancreas, also known as closed-loop control, is an “all-in-one” diabetes management system that tracks blood glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and automatically delivers the insulin when needed using an insulin pump. The system replaces reliance on testing by fingerstick or CGM with delivery of insulin by multiple daily injections or a pump controlled by the patient or caregiver.

The study enrolled 101 children between ages 6 and 13 and assigned them to either the experimental group, which used the new artificial pancreas system or to the control group which used a standard CGM and separate insulin pump. Check-ins and data collection were conducted every other week for four months.

Study participants were instructed to continue about their daily lives so that the researchers could best understand how the system works in the typical routines of the children.

The study found that youth using the artificial pancreas system had 7% improvement in keeping blood glucose in range during the daytime, and a 26% improvement in nighttime control compared to the control group. Nighttime control is of particular importance for people with type 1 diabetes, as severe, unchecked hypoglycemia can lead to seizure, coma or even death. The overall time-in-range goal for the artificial pancreas reflected a nearly 11% improvement, which translated to 2.6 more hours per day in range.

“The improvement in blood glucose control in this study was impressive, especially during the overnight hours, letting parents and caregivers sleep better at night knowing their kids are safer,” said protocol chair R. Paul Wadwa, M.D., professor of pediatrics at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes at the University of Colorado, Aurora (CU). “Artificial pancreas technology can mean fewer times children and their families have to stop everything to take care of their diabetes. Instead, kids can focus on being kids.”

Sixteen adverse events, all classified as minor, occurred in the artificial pancreas group during the study, with most due to problems with the insulin pump equipment. Three events occurred in the control group. No cases of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis occurred during the study.

“For decades, NIDDK has funded research and technology development to create a user-friendly automated device that could ease the constant burden of type 1 diabetes, from the finger sticks and insulin injections, to the insulin dose calculations and constant monitoring while improving diabetes control outcomes and preventing both short- and long-term complications of the disease,” said Arreaza-Rubín. “The artificial pancreas is a culmination of these years of effort, and it’s exciting to see how this technology may benefit children with type 1 diabetes and their families, and hopefully benefit everyone with diabetes in the future.”

The artificial pancreas technology used in this study, the Control-IQ system, has an insulin pump that is programmed with advanced control algorithms based on a mathematical model using the person’s glucose monitoring information to automatically adjust the insulin dose. This technology was derived from a system originally developed at the University of Virginia (UVA), Charlottesville, with funding support from NIDDK.

This four-month study was part of a series of trials conducted in the International Diabetes Closed-Loop (iDCL) Study. In addition to CU and UVA, study sites included Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. Jaeb Center for Health Research served as the data coordinating center.

Based on data from the iDCL trials, Tandem Diabetes Care has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use of the Control-IQ system in children as young as age 6 years.

“As we continue to search for a cure for type 1 diabetes, making artificial pancreas technology that is safe and effective, such as the technology used in this study, available to children with type 1 diabetes is a major step in improving the quality of life and disease management in these youth,” said NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers.

The iDCL Study is one of four major research efforts funded by NIDDK through the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes to test and refine advanced artificial pancreas systems. The studies, with additional results forthcoming, are looking at factors including safety, efficacy, user-friendliness, physical and emotional health of participants, and cost.

This study was funded by NIDDK through grant UC4DK108483 and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. Tandem also provided the experimental closed-loop systems used in the trial, system-related supplies including the Dexcom CGM and Roche glucometer, and technical expertise.

The NIDDK, part of the NIH, conducts and supports basic and clinical research and research training on some of the most common, severe, and disabling conditions affecting Americans.

437,"New technique makes heart valve replacement safer for some high-risk patients

Scientists have developed a novel technique that prevents coronary artery obstruction during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), a rare but often fatal complication. The method, called Bioprosthetic Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), will increase treatment options for high-risk patients who need heart valve procedures. The findings by researchers at the National Institutes of Health will publish in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions on April 2.

TAVR, a procedure used to treat aortic valve stenosis, involves threading a long, thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, through the femoral artery in the leg to the heart. Aortic valve stenosis is a fatal narrowing of the valve controlling blood leaving the heart to the rest of the body. This narrowing reduces blood flow to vital organs, resulting in shortness of breath, chest pain, blackouts, and heart failure.

For elderly or frail patients, TAVR offers an effective and less invasive alternative to open heart surgery. However, a small subset of these patients may develop coronary artery obstruction during the TAVR procedure. For more than half the patients who experience coronary artery obstruction during the TAVR, this complication has been fatal.

BASILICA was developed by Jaffar M. Khan, M.D., at the National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of NIH, to increase the safety of TAVR for this subset of patients.

“These patients are either not eligible for conventional TAVR, or they are at high risk for it,” said Robert J. Lederman, M.D., the senior investigator in NHLBI’s Division of Intramural Research who led the study with Khan.

Lederman explained that during TAVR, the surgeon places a catheter inside the heart and uses a balloon to open a new valve inside the aortic valve. However, in some patients whose hearts have uncommon structures, such as unusually large valve leaflets or small aortic roots, the large leaflets block the flow of blood to the coronary arteries as the new valve’s scaffolding opens.

“There is no good treatment or prevention strategy for TAVR-induced coronary obstruction,” said Lederman. “The previous technique of using a stent to open the coronary artery appears to have poor long-term outcomes.”

BASILICA offers a solution to the problem of coronary obstruction during TAVR. The interventional cardiologist weaves an electrified wire the size of a sewing thread through a catheter and uses it to split the original leaflet in two so that it cannot block the coronary artery once it has been pushed aside by the transcatheter heart valve.

In the current study, the researchers report the success of the BASILICA procedure in seven gravely ill patients who qualified for compassionate use of the technique — then untested in humans — because no other care options were available.

“All patients had a successful TAVR with no coronary obstruction, stroke or any major complication,” said Lederman. “They were doing well as they reached the 30-day-mark after the procedure.”

The BASILICA technique will be evaluated in a multicenter early feasibility study, sponsored by NHLBI, which began enrolling patients in January.

The researchers hope the technique will eventually help reduce the number of deaths from heart valve disease. Every year, approximately 5 million people in the United States are diagnosed with heart valve disease, and more than 20,000 die, according to the American Heart Association.

Part of the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders. The Institute also administers national health education campaigns on women and heart disease, healthy weight for children, and other topics.

441,"An unusual type of antibody that even at miniscule levels neutralizes the Zika virus and renders the virus infection undetectable in preclinical models has been identified by a team led by Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian and National Institutes of Health (NIH) investigators.

Because Zika can cause birth defects when passed from a pregnant person to their fetus, this discovery could lead to the development of therapies to protect babies from the potentially devastating effects of this disease.

In research published Nov. 18 in Cell, the investigators isolated an ultrapotent immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody -- a five-armed immune protein that latches onto the virus -- using blood cells taken from pregnant people infected with Zika. In experiments with mice, they determined that the antibody not only protected the animals from otherwise lethal infections, but also suppressed the virus to the point that it could not be detected in their blood.

Zika is currently circulating at low levels in many tropical countries, but that will inevitably change, according to co-senior author Dr. Sallie Permar, the Nancy C. Paduano Professor in Pediatrics and chair of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine and pediatrician-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Komansky Children's Hospital. Dr. Mattia Bonsignori, chief of the Translational Immunobiology Unit of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, is a co-senior author.

""The important thing is that we've got to be ready for another outbreak of Zika,"" Dr. Permar said.

At this point, doctors have no approved vaccines or treatments to offer patients. With further research, this antibody has the potential to help fill that gap, according to Dr. Permar. ""There are two potential ways it could be used: To quickly reduce levels of Zika in the blood of pregnant people who have become infected, or as a preventative measure given to those at risk of contracting the virus during an outbreak.""

Transmitted by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the Zika virus usually causes a mild illness in adults. However, Zika virus infection in pregnant people can cause severe birth defects, including abnormally small heads and brain damage in their babies.

During a Zika outbreak that began in 2015, researchers in Brazil, led by co-authors Dr. Reynaldo Dietze, of Global Health and Tropical Medicine and the Federal University of Espίrito Santo, and Dr. Camila Giuberti, also of the Federal University of Espίrito Santo, collected blood samples from pregnant people who had infections. The team decided to focus on those who were infected with Zika, but had given birth to babies that appeared healthy, because they suspected these patients might harbor antibodies capable of preventing the congenital infection.

One of these patients gave birth to an apparently healthy baby even after having Zika detectable in their blood for nearly two months, an unusually long period. The laboratory teams, led by first author Dr. Tulika Singh, a former graduate student at Duke University Medical Center where Dr. Permar's lab was located during part of this study and now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, found that their B cells produced an IgM antibody with a potent ability to prevent viral particles from invading cells.

The identity of this antibody, called DH1017.IgM, surprised the investigators because it belongs to a typically weaker, less mature type of antibody that is produced early in an infection. However, in this case, the potent function of this antibody depended on it being an IgM antibody. When the collaborators examined its molecular structure when binding to the virus, they found that multiple arms could latch onto a viral particle simultaneously. The findings suggest that IgM antibodies might be especially effective to protect against Zika virus and possibly other viruses, the authors suggest.

To develop the antibody into a therapy, the researchers plan to begin testing its safety and how effectively it can prevent transmission to a fetus in additional preclinical models. Recalling how pregnant people were left out of COVID-19 vaccine trials, Dr. Permar emphasized that when human studies for new preventive or therapeutic treatments are done for Zika, they must be included. ""Pregnant people are the exact population that needs vaccines or immunotherapies for Zika,"" she said. ""It's crucial to get anti-Zika vaccines and therapies that are safe in pregnancy rolled out as soon as there is evidence of an outbreak.""

By 2035, about 51% of the world’s population, or 4 billion people, could be overweight or have obesity, the World Obesity Atlas 2023 says. That would be a sharp rise from 2020, when about 38% of the world’s population, or 2.6 billion people, was classified as overweight or having obesity. The percentage of the world population classified as having obesity could rise from 14% in 2020 to 24% in 2035, the report says. Obesity rates among children and adolescents could double in the next 12 years. The percentage of young males with obesity could rise from 10% in 2020 to 20% in 2035, and the percentage of young females with obesity could rise from 8% to 18%.

The global economic impact of people being overweight or having obesity could reach $4.32 trillion annually by 2035 if preventive steps aren’t taken, according to the report. “At nearly 3% of global GDP (gross domestic product), this is on a par with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,” the report says. The federation based their projections on the World Health Organization’s definitions of obesity as body mass index, or BMI, over 30 and overweight as a BMI over 25. BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. The federation called for governments to make systemic changes to reverse the trend and did not blame individuals for obesity, which it calls “a chronic, relapsing disease.” “Let's be clear: the economic impact of obesity is not the fault of individuals living with the disease,” says Johanna Ralston, CEO of the Federation. “It is a result of high-level failures to provide the environmental, healthcare, food, and support systems that we all need to live happy, healthy lives.” While obesity is often considered a problem in high-income nations, 9 of the 10 countries with the greatest projected increases in obesity are low or lower-middle income countries in Asia and Africa, the report says.",0

VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report.


VAERS reports are submitted by anyone and sometimes lack details or contain errors.


VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event.


This specific limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. In the past there have been instances where people misinterpreted reports of death following vaccination as death caused by the vaccines; that is a mistake.
VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse health event. Some reports to VAERS might represent true vaccine reactions, and others might be coincidental adverse health events not related to vaccination at all.
Generally, a causal relationship cannot be established using information from VAERS reports alone.


The number of reports submitted to VAERS may increase in response to media attention and increased public awareness.

The study is published online in Global Advances in Integrative Medicine and Health.

Cereset ResearchTM with Standard Operating Procedures (CR-SOP) is the evolution of HIRREM®, or high-resolution, relational, resonance-based electroencephalic mirroring, a noninvasive, closed-loop technology that uses scalp sensors to monitor brainwaves and software algorithms to translate specific frequencies into audible tones of varying pitch.

These tones linked to brainwaves are echoed back in real time via earbuds. This allows the brain a chance to listen to itself, to look at itself in an acoustic mirror.

""CR-SOP allows the brain to reset from stress patterns that contribute to insomnia,"" said Charles H. Tegeler, M.D., chair of neurology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. ""During the intervention, the brain continuously updates with respect to its own activity patterns, resulting in auto-calibration or self-optimization.""

While still echoing brainwaves, as with legacy HIRREM, CR-SOP uses an updated platform with faster computers, new sensors and hardware, and computer management during the protocols. This results in faster echoing of brainwaves, shorter sessions and reduced dependence on technologist expertise.

In this randomized and controlled study of 22 adults, researchers compared changes on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a self-report instrument to assess insomnia symptoms. About half of the participants received 10 sessions of CR-SOP linked to brainwaves while the control group received 10 sessions of randomly generated auditory tones. Sessions were received over a mean of 15.3 days. Researchers also recorded heart rate and blood pressure to assess autonomic cardiovascular regulation.

After completion of the sessions and at follow-up visits up to six weeks later, subjects in the CR-SOP group reported reduced insomnia symptoms. They also showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in autonomic function across multiple measures such as heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) compared to those who received random tones. HRV is a powerful biometric that reflects the health of the autonomic nervous system, and BRS measures blood pressure regulation. HRV is correlated with a host of important health and well-being outcomes.

These findings are in line with previous HIRREM research that showed a reduction in insomnia symptoms.

According to Tegeler, the study also used standard operating procedures so that all subjects received the same sequence of protocols. Taken together, this greatly increases the scalability of this approach so that more people might have access, more quickly, he said.

""Closed-loop acoustic stimulation can improve sleep as well as autonomic function in those who suffer from insomnia,"" Tegeler said. ""This pilot study demonstrates these benefits with CR-SOP from sessions received over a short period. This is also an important step in showing the intervention's potential scalability for treating more people.""

Ongoing clinical trials are focused on stress and anxiety in health care workers as well as caregivers.

However, there is some concern from non-doctors that the therapy does not address the root cause of the disease. Aducanumab targets amyloid plaques in the brain, which are thought to be a key component of Alzheimer's. Biogen, the drug manufacturer, initially stopped clinical trials when one was positive and one was negative. After reevaluating its data, Biogen sought FDA approval, despite an FDA advisory committee voting against it in November 2020. The FDA ultimately approved it, but questions remain about whether the benefits for patients are significant enough compared to potential side effects.

In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritised in individuals who are more susceptible or more at risk of severe disease. Individuals in risk groups may also be more at risk of hospitalisation or death due to non-COVID-19 causes, and thus may be hospitalised or die with COVID-19 rather than because of COVID-19.

The California Poison Control System does not recommend ingesting eucalyptus oil. Amounts as little as 1ml have caused toxic symptoms in children, and as little as 15ml in adults have led to significant toxicity and hospitalization.
 The toxic dose range for eucalyptus oil is all over the map. The important point to convey is that toxicities (and fatalities) have been reported with ingestions, and it is not a one size fits all scenario/it depends on the situation. So, it is best to call the poison center (1-800-222-1222) if there is an exposure. Common effects include nausea and vomiting that can lead to aspiration of the oil into the lungs and cause pneumonia. Eucalyptol, the monoterpenoid found in eucalyptus oil can also affect the autonomic nervous system resulting in seizures and coma.

457,"Nov. 30, 2022 -- Widely anticipated data from a phase 3 trial of a new Alzheimer’s disease treatment suggests the drug ""modestly"" relieved cognitive problems in patients early into the disease — but at a cost. In the trial, adverse events among patients taking the drug, lecanemab, were common compared with placebo, including leaking blood vessels ; and a news report this week linked a second death to the drug. Moving forward, ""longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease,"" Christopher H. van Dyck, MD, of the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, CT, and colleagues write. The full trial findings were presented at the 15th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference, and were also published Nov. 29 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The phase 3 trial of lecanemab has been closely watched in Alzheimer’s circles, especially considering positive early data released in September, reported by Medscape Medical News at that time. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve the drug in January. The agency has approved only one other similar treatment, the highly controversial and expensive aducanumab (Aduhelm). For the new 18-month, randomized, double-blind trial, researchers enrolled 1,795 patients ages 50 to 90 with early Alzheimer’s.. All were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or intravenous lecanemab. The study ran from 2019 to 2021. The participants (52% women, 20% non-White) were recruited in North America, Europe, and Asia. Those on the experimental drug scored 27% better on a Alzheimer’s rating scale compared to those on the placebo. The study authors did not speculate about how this difference would affect the day-to-day life of patients who took the drug, although it does refer to ""modestly less decline"" of cognition/function in the lecanemab group. With respect to adverse events, deaths occurred in both groups (0.7% in those who took lecanemab and 0.8% in those who took the placebo). The researchers did not attribute any deaths to the drug. However, the journal Science reported Nov. 27 that a 65-year-old woman who was taking the drug as part of a clinical trial ""recently died from a massive brain hemorrhage that some researchers link to the drug.""

The woman, the second person ""whose death was linked to lecanemab,"" died after suffering a stroke. Science summarized a case report as saying that the drug ""contributed to her brain hemorrhage after biweekly infusions of lecanemab inflamed and weakened the blood vessels."" Eisai, which sponsored the new trial, told Science that ""all the available safety information indicates that lecanemab therapy is not associated with an increased risk of death overall or from any specific cause."" In separate interviews with Medscape Medical News, two Alzheimer’s specialists who weren’t involved in the study praised the trial and described the findings as “exciting.” But they also highlighted its limitations. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, MD, PhD, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School

and chief medical officer of Linus Health, said the study represents impressive progress after 60-plus trials examining what are known as anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies. “This is the first trial that shows a clinical benefit that can be measured,” he said. However, it’s unclear whether the changes “are really going to make a difference in people’s lives,” he said. The drug is likely to be expensive due to the large investment needed for research, he added, and patients will have to undergo costly testing such as PET scans and spinal taps. Howard Fillit, MD, co-founder and chief science officer at the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, noted that the trial reached its primary and secondary endpoints and had what he called a “modest” effect on cognition. However, the drugmaker will need to explore the adverse effects, he said, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation who take anticoagulants. And, he said, medicine is still far from the ultimate goal -- fully reversing cognitive decline. In a statement, the Alzheimer’s Association raved about lecanemab and declared the FDA should approve lecanemab on an accelerated basis. The study “confirms this treatment can meaningfully change the course of the disease for people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease…,” the association said, adding that “it could mean many months more of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren.” The association, which is also a staunch supporter of aducanumab, called on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cover the drug if the FDA approves it. The association’s statement did not address the drug’s potential high cost, the adverse effects, or the 2 reported deaths.",0

460,"NIH-funded researchers see extended health span and lifespan in treated mice.

Injecting senescent cells into young mice results in a loss of health and function but treating the mice with a combination of two existing drugs cleared the senescent cells from tissues and restored physical function. The drugs also extended both life span and health span in naturally aging mice, according to a new study in Nature Medicine, published online on July 9, 2018. The research was supported primarily by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health.

A research team led by James L. Kirkland, M.D., Ph.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota found that injecting even a small number of senescent cells into young, healthy mice causes damage that can result in physical dysfunction. The researchers also found that treatment with a combination of dasatinib and quercetin could prevent cell damage, delay physical dysfunction, and, when used in naturally aging mice, extend their lifespan.

“This study provides compelling evidence that targeting a fundamental aging process — in this case, cell senescence in mice — can delay age-related conditions, resulting in better health and longer life,” said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D. “This study also shows the value of investigating biological mechanisms which may lead to better understanding of the aging process.”

Many normal cells continuously grow, die, and replicate. Cell senescence is a process in which cells lose function, including the ability to divide and replicate, but are resistant to cell death. Such cells have been shown to affect neighboring ones because they secrete several pro-inflammatory and tissue remodeling molecules. Senescent cells increase in many tissues with aging; they also occur in organs associated with many chronic diseases and after radiation or chemotherapy.

Senolytics are a class of drugs which selectively eliminate senescent cells. In this study, Kirkland’s team used a combination of dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) to test whether this senolytic combination could slow physical dysfunction caused by senescent cells. Dasatinib is used to treat some forms of leukemia; quercetin is a plant flavanol found in some fruits and vegetables.

To determine whether senescent cells caused physical dysfunction, the researchers first injected young (four-month-old) mice with either senescent (SEN) cells or non-senescent control (CON) cells. As early as two weeks after transplantation, the SEN mice showed impaired physical function as determined by maximum walking speed, muscle strength, physical endurance, daily activity, food intake, and body weight. In addition, the researchers saw increased numbers of senescent cells, beyond what was injected, suggesting a propagation of the senescence effect into neighboring cells.

To then analyze whether a senolytic compound could stop or delay physical dysfunction, researchers treated both SEN and CON mice for three days with the D+Q compound mix. They found that D+Q selectively killed senescent cells and slowed the deterioration in walking speed, endurance, and grip strength in the SEN mice.

In addition to young mice injected with senescent cells, the researchers also tested older (20-month-old), non-transplanted mice with D+Q intermittently for 4 months. D+Q alleviated normal age-related physical dysfunction, resulting in higher walking speed, treadmill endurance, grip strength, and daily activity.

Finally, the researchers found that treating very old (24- to 27-month-old) mice with D+Q biweekly led to a 36 percent higher average post-treatment life span and lower mortality hazard than control mice. This indicates that senolytics can reduce risk of death in old mice.

“This is exciting research,” said Felipe Sierra, Ph.D., director of NIA’s Division of Aging Biology. “This study clearly demonstrates that senolytics can relieve physical dysfunction in mice. Additional research will be necessary to determine if compounds, like the one used in this study, are safe and effective in clinical trials with people.”

The researchers noted that current and future pre-clinical studies may show that senolytics could be used to enhance life span not only in older people, but also in cancer survivors treated with senescence-inducing radiation or chemotherapy and people with a range of senescence-associated chronic diseases.

462,"Subgroups of tuberculosis (TB)-causing bacteria can persist even when antibiotics wipe out most of the overall population. The need to eliminate these persistent subpopulations is one reason why TB treatment regimens are so lengthy. Now, researchers have shown that a single protein allows mycobacteria to generate diverse populations that can avoid TB drugs. The protein may be a target for intervention; blocking it might result in less mycobacterial diversity and shorten TB treatment courses. The research was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Eric J. Rubin, M.D., Ph.D., of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and E. Hesper Rego, Ph.D., of Yale University School of Medicine, and their coworkers first studied Mycobacterium smegmatis, a close relative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the microbe that causes TB. Using fluorescent reporter molecules and time-lapse microscopy, they examined individual cells as they grew and divided. Mycobacteria can generate daughter cells through asymmetric growth, resulting in genetically identical, but physiologically diverse, populations. The mechanisms underlying this ability and the extent to which the cells’ size, growth rate and other physiological properties relate to survival in mycobacterial populations were not well understood.

Dr. Rubin and colleagues determined that the protein product of a single gene, lamA, is a member of the protein machinery that is active when mycobacteria divide. The protein — which is not known to exist in other rod-shaped bacteria or other organisms — seems to allow for asymmetrical growth in new mycobacterial cells made during cell division. The asymmetrical growth leads to bacteria with wide variations in physiological properties and susceptibility to antibiotics.

In experiments using Mtb, the scientists found that mycobacteria without lamA formed far less diverse bacteria with more uniform susceptibility to antibiotics. When exposed to the front-line TB drug rifampicin, for example, Mtb cells lacking lamA were less able to survive than wildtype bacteria. In the future, it may be possible to devise ways to inhibit lamA or its protein. This could lead to reduced variation in Mtb populations and, potentially, to more uniform vulnerability to drugs, according to the scientists.

467,"Oct. 14, 2022 – Adults with persistent cases of long COVID lost some of their ability to exercise 3 months after getting COVID, according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open. Researchers from the University of California San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital identified 38 previous studies that used cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to measure how well people with long COVID could exercise after recovering from COVID. CPET measured how much oxygen they used as they exercised on either a stationary bike or a treadmill to find out how well their heart and lungs were working. Someone who used to play doubles tennis, for example, may find that they need to transition to a lower-impact sport like golf if they have long COVID symptoms, lead author and UCSF cardiologist Matthew Durstenfeld, MD, said in a news release. “But it’s important to note that this is an average,” he said. “Some individuals experience a profound decrease in energy capacity and many others experience no decrease.”

The team narrowed down their sample from 38 studies to 9, comparing exercise testing results from 359 people who recovered from COVID to that of 464 people who had symptoms consistent with long COVID. The age range of the people studied was 39 to 56 years old. While the authors say they have some reservations about the results from their meta-analysis – mainly due to the studies’ small sample sizes, oversampling of COVID patients who were hospitalized, and varying definitions of long COVID – their findings still ""provided evidence of a clinically significant, mild to moderate decrease in exercise capacity among individuals with [long COVID] compared with infected individuals without symptoms despite different definitions of [long COVID],” they wrote. Losing some ability to exercise because of long COVID symptoms isn’t new information, but understanding the role of CPET results in long COVID patients may be a powerful measuring tool. Among the study’s limits, the researchers noted, was that their search plan was not peer-reviewed and the studies included in the analysis were not limited solely to peer-reviewed papers. Selection bias – that so many people in the study had been evaluated after recovering from severe COVID infections – also made it difficult to get a clear picture of how common reduced exercise capacity is. “Further research should include long-term observational assessments to understand the trajectory of exercise capacity,” says author Priscilla Hsue, MD. “Trials of potential therapies are urgently needed, including studies of rehabilitation to address deconditioning, as well as further investigation into dysfunctional breathing, damage to the nerves that control automatic body functions and the inability to increase the heart rate adequately during exercise.”",0

473,"It was once thought that Ebola and related filoviruses were more or less contained to Central Africa. After a West African outbreak and the discovery of Reston ebolavirus in the Philippines, cuevavirus in Spain and various bat filoviruses in China, researchers now understand that this viral family -- causing hemorrhagic fevers with up to 90% case fatality rates -- has been widespread around the world for millions of years.

Our defenses against it are more embryonic, and though we have a vaccine against one species of Ebola and some therapeutic antibodies on the horizon, both have production or distribution issues. What doctors have been hoping for is a regular drug that can treat Ebola as soon as it rears its terrifying head. A study published today in the journal PLOS Pathogens, identifies a pathway that all filoviruses use to gain entry into our cells -- and shows how they can be stopped in their tracks by at least one FDA-approved drug.

Ebola is so pernicious because it pulls a fast one on the body, disguising itself as a dying cell.

""It's cloaking itself in a lipid that is normally not exposed at the surface of a cell. It's only exposed when the cell is undergoing apoptosis,"" says Dr. Marceline Côté, an associate professor in the department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Antiviral Therapeutics and the primary investigator on this study. Dr. Côté is a leading global expert on how viruses get into us, an understanding that is key to any effort to keep them out.

The malingering virus is then taken up by immune system cells that unwittingly carry the virus to other parts of the body, disseminating the infection. Virtually all organs become active sites of replication, and the result is a vicious, multi-system disease. Once it tricks its way into the cell, the virus needs to find a specific receptor that serves as the lock for its glycoprotein key, kicking off the process that will allow it to multiply. A drug that prevents it from any one step in turning that key could defeat the disease.

Dr. Côté's team, in particular PhD student Corina Stewart, tested a library of drugs against a virus in cell cultures. It's not safe to work with a replicating Ebola virus in a regular lab, so the uOttawa team used a surrogate system.

""We use a safe virus disguised as an Ebola virus. They will enter just the same way as an Ebola virus, but actually the inside core when they uncoat is all safe stuff,"" says Dr. Coté. ""It's murine leukemia virus or engineered retroviruses, so nothing to worry about.""

Once they found a collection of drugs that seemed to work, they passed the data to collaborator Dr. Darwyn Kobasa at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, where a biosafety level 4 rating allows researchers to handle the bona fide virus. Dr. Kobasa confirmed that a small number of cancer chemotherapy drugs were effective in preventing Ebola from gaining a foothold in the cells.

Though these types of drugs can be tough on the body, an Ebola infection carries a high risk of death. What's more, the infection doesn't last long, so any unpleasant treatment can be similarly brief.

Knowing which drugs worked against Ebola also tells the team more about how the virus gets in. In particular, this study shows that Ebola virus has evolved ways to be active in its invasion of a cell. Previously, it was thought that viral entry was left mostly up to chance, with many particles being left behind while a random few were taken up into the cell. Dr. Côté's study shows the virus has evolved to get in very efficiently, rather than just going along for the ride.

""They are not passive passengers,"" says Dr. Côté. ""They have their hands on the steering wheel.""",0

Furthermore, inappropriate interactions may lead to the silencing of other immune responses.

Although immune checkpoint-based immunotherapy has been shown to have great potential, only a small proportion of patients fully respond to this therapy, and the relevant molecular mechanisms need to be further explored. This delivery method is however complex and inefficient.

In a breakthrough development, a team of scientists led by Narat Muzayyin Chair Professor Chen Xiaoyuan from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Professor Liu Gang from Xiamen University has formulated a novel vaccine which showed high efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors, achieving complete clearance of solid tumors and inducing long-lasting immune memory. This prevents the relapse of tumour growth that the patient originally presented with and provides immunity against similar tumour types. This was shown through the application of this vaccine on melanoma tumour models.

The team was able to engineer a dendritic cell (a type of APC) membrane that was used to naturally stimulate the immune system and activate multi-dimensional anti-tumor immunity. This was done through an antigen self-presentation and immunosuppression reversal nanovesicle vaccine platform, which prompted the team to coin its moniker, ASPIRE.

The ASPIRE vaccine system can quickly elicit appropriate, antigen-specific immune responses in a way that traditional vaccine methods could not. This mode of antigen presentation greatly improves the efficiency of immune activation, which facilitates this novel vaccine's high efficacy relative to other vaccines currently available. In addition, the vaccine can also activate both previously unexposed T cells and exhausted T cells which facilitates ASPIRE's superior anti-tumour immune capabilities.

""We are excited at this platform technology's potential for further application in other diseases as well, such as chronic viral infection, in which T-cell exhaustion often occurs during infection and prevents the optimal viral control,"" said Prof Chen. ""Next, the team hopes to establish a standard operating procedure for scaled synthesis of the vaccine, with proper quality control of the membrane vesicles, for clinical translation, he added.

Speaking independently on the study, Professor Chng Wee Joo, Senior Consultant of the Division of Haematology at the Department of Haematology-Oncology in the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore and myeloma specialist said: ""The field of cancer immunotherapy is offering tremendous hope to cancer patients. However, there are some shortcomings with the current technologies. The present innovation from Prof Chen and his colleagues overcome some of these deficiencies and improved the effectiveness and sustainability of the immune response to these treatments. This will provide a significant advance that will have important impact on patients.""",0
476,"NIH-funded study suggests targeting cell may help prevent anaphylaxis in humans.

Allergies can be life-threatening when they cause anaphylaxis, an extreme reaction with constriction of the airways and a sudden drop in blood pressure. Scientists have identified a subtype of immune cell that drives the production of antibodies associated with anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions. The research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and reveals a potential target for new therapies to prevent severe allergic reactions. The findings are published online today in the journal Science.

Investigators at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut, and their collaborators discovered a subtype of T cells—called T follicular helper cell 13, or Tfh13 cells — in laboratory mice bred to have a rare genetic immune disease called DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome. In humans, DOCK8 deficiency leads to recurrent viral infections of the skin and respiratory system and to severe allergies and asthma.

Allergies and anaphylaxis are linked to the production of high levels of high-affinity IgE antibodies, which bind strongly to allergens to spur allergic reactions. The investigators noted that mice with a DOCK8 deficiency had novel T follicular helper cells, not found in normal mice, that produced a unique combination of chemical messengers called cytokines.

They then took mice with normal immune systems and sensitized them with respiratory and food allergens to induce severe allergic reactions leading to anaphylaxis. While non-allergic mice lacked Tfh13 cells, allergic mice had both Tfh13 cells and high-affinity IgE. With genetic manipulation, the scientists prevented Tfh13 cell development in mice and found that the animals did not make anaphylactic IgE to allergens. To transfer this insight to humans, they then compared blood samples from people with peanut or respiratory allergies to those of non-allergic volunteers and found that individuals with allergies and the associated IgE had elevated levels of Tfh13 cells.

The study authors conclude that Tfh13 cells are responsible for directing antibody-producing B cells to create high-affinity IgE and that Tfh13 cells may be required for allergic disease, including anaphylaxis. They say targeting Tfh13 cells may represent a new strategy to prevent or treat allergic diseases. While such a strategy would likely not replace life-saving, emergency epinephrine when anaphylaxis occurs, therapies targeting Tfh13 cells might prevent the onset of anaphylaxis when an allergic person is exposed to an allergen.

Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology, which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Science is an unpredictable and incremental process — each research advance builds on past discoveries, often in unexpected ways. Most clinical advances would not be possible without the knowledge of fundamental basic research.

NIAID conducts and supports research — at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide — to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

477,"A recent study found that a Medicaid program in Colorado helps address the shortage of home healthcare workers for children with complex medical needs by offering family members certified nursing assistant (CNA) training and paying them for at-home medical care for their child. However, children who received family-CNA care were more likely to be hospitalized than those cared for by non-family CNAs. Nonetheless, children with family-CNA caregivers experienced greater care continuity since turnover was not an issue, as it tends to be with traditional home healthcare workers. The study's findings suggest that states should consider policies that allow parents to be paid caregivers for their child with relevant credentials, while also reducing family financial strain. This program may not fit all situations, but it represents a meaningful option for many children lacking sufficient services. The Manne Research Institute is not focused on improving child health, transforming pediatric medicine, or ensuring healthier futures through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, unlike Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, which is ranked as one of the nation's top children's hospitals by U.S. News & World Report and is the pediatric training ground for Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.",1

484,"The medicinal secrets of the Chilean soapbark tree have been laid bare, unlocking a future of more potent, affordable, and sustainably sought vaccines.

The evergreen species, Quillaja saponaria has, for decades, been highly prized for producing molecules called QS saponins, which are used in the food and drinks industry as foaming agents.

More recently an important new function has emerged with saponins obtained from the tree's bark used as potent adjuvants in the production of vaccines. Adjuvants play a critical role in some vaccines, working to boost the potency of a vaccine by enhancing the host immune response.

Molecules extracted from soapbark tree are used as adjuvants in vaccines protecting people against COVID-19, shingles, and malaria.

QS saponins are sourced directly from the tree and although this is at a much smaller scale than the food and drink industry, vaccine manufacturers are actively working to reduce the environmental impact and improve sustainability of sourcing these important resources.

Researchers at the John Innes Centre have taken a major step forward in addressing this problem, by using a combination of genome mining and bioengineering techniques to produce saponin-based vaccine adjuvants in the laboratory without harvesting material directly from trees.

Dr James Reed, first author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at the John Innes Centre says: ""These are complex molecules that have thwarted attempts to synthesize them at scale using chemistry in the lab. After many twists and turns, we have now discovered the core set of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of QS saponins.""

In research which appears in Science, the Osbourn group at the John Innes Centre first sequenced the genome of Quillaja saponaria. Then they used powerful computational gene-mining tools to predict which among the ~30,000 genes that make up its genome were responsible for saponin biosynthesis.

This led to the identification of a biosynthetic pathway of 16 genes which together produce the enzymes which are nature's building blocks for saponin production. Together these newly discovered genes and enzymes act as an instruction manual for future adjuvant bioengineering, say the team.

Identification of a further three enzymes resulted in a complete biosynthetic pathway to the saponin QS-7, a saponin that is included in a vaccine adjuvant with proven clinical efficacy, but that is notoriously difficult to purify from soapbark tree.

The pathway to these molecules was reconstructed in a plant called Nicotiana benthamiana, using a rapid and powerful technique called transient combinatorial expression.

This dwarf wild relative of tobacco is well known as an amenable host for the bioproduction of therapeutic proteins and pharmaceuticals.

The team is already using this instruction manual to attempt to produce other valuable saponins including QS-21, a potent adjuvant and key component in human vaccines.

The levels of saponins produced in this study equate to amounts normally obtained from the leaves of the soapbark tree rather than its bark.

The team have partnered with Plant Bioscience Limited (PBL, Norwich UK), who are leading on the commercialisation of the research and are now looking to work with commercial and academic partners to scale up these quantities further.

Professor Anne Osbourn, the lead of the study, and a group leader at the John Innes Centre said: ""The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the huge demand for lifesaving vaccines. By assembling the genome sequence of Quillaja saponaria we now have the instruction manual which has enabled us to decode how the tree makes these potent medicinal molecules. This opens the possibility of producing known and new-to-nature saponin-based vaccine adjuvants optimized for immunostimulant activity and suitable for human applications in our rapid transient plant expression system.""

Elucidation of the pathway for biosynthesis of saponin adjuvants from the soapbark tree appears in Science.

Described as hidden helpers, vaccine adjuvants are immunostimulatory substances that are added to some vaccines to boost the immune response, doing so by inducing strong antibody and T-cell responses.

Until recently the only adjuvants in clinical use were insoluble aluminium salts or oil in water emulsions containing squalene, an organic compound obtained from shark liver.

As natural surfactants, saponins have been used in veterinary medicine for a century. But these adjuvants have been unsuitable for human use due to poor tolerability. A vaccine containing a saponin-based adjuvant has been approved for use in humans.

QS-7 and QS-21 are included in a complex mix of saponins formulated as Matrix-M adjuvant in the Novavax COVID 19 vaccine. Approval of this vaccine in countries worldwide is increasing the interest for saponin-based adjuvants and alternative methods of production.

Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway will enable researchers to develop bespoke saponin-based adjuvants with a diverse spectrum of immune-stimulating properties.",0
485,"Vitamins C and E and beta carotene, either individually or in combination, do not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events or death among women at high risk for heart disease, according to a report in the August 13/27 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine.

Oxidative damage--harm to cells caused by exposure to oxygen--may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, according to background information in the article. In addition, compounds known as free radicals may damage artery linings, encourage blood clots and alter the function of blood vessels.

""Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and limit the damage they can cause,"" the authors write. ""Diets high in fruit and vegetable intake, and thus rich in such antioxidants, have been associated with reduced rates of coronary heart disease and stroke. Vitamins C and E and beta carotene are potential mediators of the apparent protective effect of a plant-based diet on cardiovascular disease.""

Nancy R. Cook, Sc.D., of Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and colleagues tested the effects of these compounds in the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, which followed 8,171 women 40 years or older (average age 60.6) beginning in 1995 to 1996. The women, who either had a history of cardiovascular disease or three or more risk factors, were randomly assigned to take 500 milligrams of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or placebo every day; 600 international units of vitamin E or placebo every other day; and 50 milligrams of beta carotene or placebo every other day. Participants were followed up for the occurrence of heart events (including stroke, heart attack and bypass surgery) or death through 2005.

During the average study period of 9.4 years, 1,450 women had one or more cardiovascular events, including 274 heart attacks, 298 strokes, 889 coronary revascularization procedures (bypass surgery or angioplasty) and 395 cardiovascular deaths (out of a total 995 deaths). ""There was no overall effect of ascorbic acid, vitamin E or beta carotene on the primary combined end point or on the individual secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization or cardiovascular disease death,"" the authors write. ""There were no significant interactions between agents for the primary end point, but those randomized to both active ascorbic acid and vitamin E experienced fewer strokes.""

No additional adverse effects were observed for those taking active pills vs. placebo, with the exception of a small increase in reports of upset stomach among those taking active beta carotene.

""Overall, we found no benefit on the primary combined end point for any of the antioxidant agents tested, alone or in combination,"" the authors conclude. ""We also found no evidence for harm. While additional research into combinations of agents, particularly for stroke, may be of interest, widespread use of these individual agents for cardiovascular protection does not appear warranted.""

This study was supported by an investigator-initiated grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Vitamin E and its placebo were supplied by Cognis Corporation (LaGrange, Ill.). All other agents and their placebos were supplied by BASF Corporation (Mount Olive, N.J.). Pill packaging was provided by Cognis and BASF.",0

490,"Prominent claims from observational studies of the cardiovascular benefits of vitamin E often continue to be supported in medical literature despite strong contradictory evidence from randomized trials, according to a new study. Similar findings were found for claims regarding the protective effects of beta-carotene on cancer and estrogen on Alzheimer disease.

""Some research findings that have received wide attention in the scientific community, as proven by the high citation counts of the respective articles, are eventually contradicted by subsequent evidence. A number of such high-profile contradictions pertain to differences between nonrandomized and randomized studies,"" the authors write. Despite these contradictions, findings from observational trials may still be supported in some scientific circles.

Athina Tatsioni, M.D., of the University of Ioannina School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece, and colleagues evaluated the change in favorable vs. unfavorable citations for two highly cited epidemiological studies that proposed major cardiovascular benefits associated with vitamin E in 1993, which were strongly contradicted by evidence from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). To assess the generalizability of these findings, the researchers also examined the extent to which two other major contradicted claims, the effectiveness of beta-carotene for preventing cancer and of estrogens for preventing Alzheimer dementia, continue to be supported in the current medical literature.

For the vitamin E claims, the researchers sampled articles published in 1997, 2001, and 2005 (before, early, and late after publication of refuting evidence) that referenced the highly cited epidemiological studies and separately sampled articles published in 2005 and referencing the major contradicting RCT (HOPE trial). They also sampled articles published in 2006 that referenced highly cited articles proposing benefits associated with beta-carotene for cancer (published in 1981 and contradicted by RCTs in 1994-1996) and estrogen for Alzheimer disease (published in 1996 and contradicted by RCTs in 2004).

The researchers found that for the two vitamin E epidemiological studies, even in 2005, 50 percent of citing articles remained favorable. A favorable stance was independently less likely in more recent articles, specifically in articles that also cited the HOPE trial and in general/internal medicine vs. specialty journals. In a sample of 29 articles published in 2005 that had cited the HOPE study, six (20.7 percent) were still favorable to vitamin E, 11 (37.9 percent) were equivocal (uncertain), and 12 (41.4 percent) were unfavorable. ""Even among articles that cited the contradicting HOPE trial rather than the positive epidemiological studies, the majority in 2005 still could not conclude that vitamin E was ineffective,"" the authors write.

Regarding the claims for beta-carotene, 10 citing articles (62.5 percent) were favorable, three (18.8 percent) equivocal, and three (18.8 percent) unfavorable. For estrogen, 29 citing articles (61.7 percent) were favorable, 14 (29.8 percent) equivocal, and 4 (8.5 percent) unfavorable. All beta-carotene citations and all but two estrogen citations appeared in specialty journals.

""Counterarguments defending vitamin E or estrogen included diverse selection and information biases and genuine differences across studies in participants, interventions, co-interventions, and outcomes. Favorable citations to beta-carotene, long after evidence contradicted its effectiveness, did not consider the contradicting evidence.""

""... it can be difficult to discern whether perpetuated beliefs are based on careful consideration of all evidence and differential interpretation, inappropriate entrenchment of old information, lack of dissemination of newer data, or purposeful silencing of their existence. Regardless of the reasons, better communication between research specialists and evidence-based clinical science may improve this situation and may lead to more rational and concerted translational efforts in basic, pre-clinical, and clinical research,"" the researchers conclude.",0
491,"Almost 200 species of bacteria colonize microfibers in the Mediterranean Sea, including one that causes food poisoning in humans, according to a new study led by Maria Luiza Pedrotti of Sorbonne Université, published November 30 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.

Synthetic and natural microfibers from plastic pollution, the textile industry and fishing activities have increased dramatically in the environment, becoming the most common type of particles in the ocean. These microfibers likely pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health, because once they become colonized by microorganisms, they smell like food and are consumed by marine organisms. Due to their persistence, the microfibers likely build up in marine organisms as they move through the food chain.

To find out what types of bacteria live on floating microfibers, researchers used advanced microscopy techniques and DNA sequencing to identify microorganisms living on microfibers collected from the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. They discovered that more than 2,600 cells on average live on each microfiber. These cells belong to 195 bacterial species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a potentially dangerous bacterium that causes food poisoning from seafood.

This new study is the first to report the presence of pathogenic Vibrio species on microfibers in the Mediterranean Sea. The discovery is important for assessing health risks, because the bacterium's presence can be a threat to bathing and seafood consumption.

The study also raises the question of the environmental risk of microfibers. The increasing amount of persistent plastic waste in the environment may be transporting dangerous bacteria and other pollutants throughout the ocean, thus increasing the risk of contamination compared to short-lived natural particles, such as wood or sediments.

Maria Luiza Pedrotti adds: ""The role of climate change also has an influence on the spread of this potentially pathogenic bacteria. Studies have shown that temperature has a significant correlation with the increase of Vibrio spp and the emergence of infections. At the time we found this vibrio, coastal summer temperatures ranged from 25.2-26.5°C, while this year, at the same location, they reached 29°C.""",0

495,"T and B lymphocytes, which are part of a group of immune cells commonly called white blood cells, work together to eliminate foreign invaders in the body such as viruses. However, certain diseases can arise when T and B cells are activated at inappropriate times, including autoimmune disorders and various cancers. In a recent article published in Nature Communications, a team led by researchers at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) describe a technology called a heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) that they developed to deliver to lymphocytes and regulate their functions.

Gene expression is at the root of controlling cellular activity. Disease can result when certain genes are either improperly turned off or are uncontrollably expressed. Therefore, scientists have aimed to develop therapeutic methods to restore gene expression levels to their healthy state, ideally only in the abnormal cells. One such modality is delivering specifically engineered DNA or RNA molecules that can locate the misexpressed gene messages and direct the cell to lower them back to normal levels. However, the most difficult part of this is ensuring the therapeutic molecules can efficiently reach their proper destination without being degraded by the cell.

""Our team designed a DNA/RNA hybrid molecule called an HDO,"" says lead author of the study Masaki Ohyagi. ""The specific sequence of the HDO can be altered to target a particular gene of interest, while its backbone makes it stable within cells.""

A key part of the team's HDO design is the addition of a molecule called α-tocopherol, which is crucial to its proper delivery. Because α-tocopherol is essential for proper lymphocytic immune responses, adding this allows the HDO to be delivered within peripheral blood and directed to lymphocytes. The team designed HDOs for several mouse genes and then intravenously injected them into lab mice.

""We found that our HDO technology was able to specifically silence these genes in mouse lymphocytes more robustly and stably, and also with less toxicity, than other previous versions of this method,"" states Takanori Yokota, senior author of the article. ""Our studies also showed that the HDOs enter these cells through a process called endocytosis.""

After finding that their technology was effective at gene silencing, the TMDU team investigated if it could be useful as a disease treatment. They designed an HDO targeting a gene called Itga4, which is central to the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS).

""Intravenously injecting these mice with an Itga4-targeting HDO delayed the onset and improved EAE symptoms and reduced both inflammatory cell infiltration and spinal cord demyelination,"" explains Ohyagi.

This work demonstrates the powerful gene silencing effects of the HDO technology, as well as its superior delivery capabilities relative to other similar methods. Most significantly, the Itga4-specific HDO was able to improve outcomes in an MS mouse model, suggesting it may be useful as a novel therapeutic that could be developed for human immune-mediated diseases.",0
496,"June 3, 2022 – It’s long been known that tall people have an increased risk for several diseases, including irregular heartbeat and varicose veins. But a study adds new conditions to that list: nerve damage in the arms and legs, as well as skin and bone infections. That said, being tall does have health advantages, such as a lowered risk for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, according to the study published in PLOS Genetics. The researchers used data from the VA Million Veteran Program to look at genetic and health information for more than 200,000 white adults and more than 50,000 Black adults. The researchers looked at more than 1,000 medical conditions and traits overall. “Using genetic methods applied to the VA Million Veteran Program, we found evidence that adult height may impact over 100 clinical traits, including several conditions associated with poor outcomes and quality of life – peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity ulcers, and chronic venous insufficiency,” Sridharan Raghavan, MD, of the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, who led the research, said in a news release.

“We conclude that height may be an unrecognized non-modifiable risk factor for several common conditions in adults.” While the link between height and common health conditions has been known for a long time, it’s not been clear if being tall or short puts people at risk or whether other things, such as nutrition and social and economic status, are to blame. The study tried to remove those other factors by looking “at connections between various diseases and a person's actual height, and connections to their predicted height based on their genetics,” the release said. People in the study had a mean height of 176 centimeters, or 5 feet 9 inches, and were 91.6% male. The study confirmed previous studies that found people with above-average height have a higher risk for atrial fibrillation and varicose veins, and a lower risk for cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, elevated lipid levels, and coronary heart disease. One of the new findings was a connection between height and peripheral neuropathy, or nerve damage to the extremities, and bone and skin infections, such as leg ulcers. The researchers said more studies are needed to clarify some of these findings, preferably with a larger, more diverse, and more international study group.",0

498,"New research led by the University of Kent's School of Psychology has found that some brain activity methods used to detect incriminating memories do not work accurately in older adults.

Findings show that concealed information tests relying on electrical activity of the brain (electroencephalography [EEG]) are ineffective in older adults because of changes to recognition-related brain activity that occurs with aging.

EEG-based forensic memory detection is based on the logic that guilty suspects will hold incriminating knowledge about crimes they have committed, and therefore their brains will elicit a recognition response in the EEG when confronted with reminders of their crimes.

The team of researchers at Kent led by Dr Robin Hellerstedt and Dr Zara Bergström conducted the study with 30 participants under the age of 30 and 30 participants over the age of 65. All participants undertook a concealed information test to detect if they recognised details from a mock crime they had just committed, which would indicate criminal guilt. However, only young adults showed a strong EEG recognition response to reminders of the crime, with such responses being absent in the older group. This failure to detect memories with EEG brain activity occurred even though the older group had the same knowledge about the crime as the younger group, and had just as good general recognition memory ability.

The research published by Cortex therefore suggests that EEG-based forensic memory detection tests have limited practical applications with less validity in older adults than younger populations.

Dr Bergström said: 'Our research demonstrates that EEG-based forensic memory detection in older age is impaired, even with methods that compensate for potential age differences in frequency, timing and location of brain responses.

'Further investigation is needed to examine the ability of these tests to detect concealed memories of real crimes, and whether memory detection in older age is a reflection of permanent changes in brain functioning or is influenced by motivational processes that can vary across situations. Findings could have implications for processes within the criminal justice system, such as the use of polygraph techniques, which may be vulnerable to similar limitations.'",0

500,"Researchers have shown that key chemicals that carry cholesterol and fats in the blood accumulate in people with type 2 diabetes, which may help improve treatment of this disease.

Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than it should be and too much insulin is produced to counter this blood sugar increase. Patients with this disease have increased levels of triglycerides -- the most important type of fat -- in their blood and high levels of a chemical called triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) that carries cholesterol and fats in the blood and is produced in the intestines. But how TRL accumulates in the blood is not well understood.

Patrick Couture and colleagues discovered that overaccumulation of TRL is due to an increased production of lipoproteins that contain proteins called apolipoprotein B-48 and apolipoprotein B-100, which are known to cause heart disease. The scientists also showed that the breakdown of these proteins was reduced, further contributing to their build-up. These results may help devise treatments that reduce the production of apolipoprotein B-48 and apolipoprotein B-100 in type 2 diabetes patients, thus reducing their risks of developing heart disease.

501,"Labour and natural childbirth causes stress on a mother's body but an emergency Caesarean is associated with even more inflammatory gene expression in the placenta, new South Australian research shows.

The study, led by Flinders University's Pregnancy Health and Beyond (PHaB) Lab and other researchers, investigated differences in placenta inflammation markers after delivery of both male and female babies involved in 20 emergency Caesarean procedures -- compared with 40 placentas from vaginal (or 'natural') deliveries and 10 placentas from an elective C-section at an Adelaide public maternity hospital between 2006 and 2018.

""Labour is an inherently inflammatory process, so if you have a planned or pre-labour Caesarean section there will be less inflammasome activation than seen in an emergency C-section in a woman already in labour or in an unassisted vaginal birth,"" says Dr Anya Arthurs, the lead author of a new article in Frontiers of Immunology.

""In births where labour is involved, there is more inflammatory gene expression in the placenta if you had an emergency Caesarean section compared to a vaginal birth.

""This study also indicates that babies, in particular females, could be more compromised in their development and long-term health and wellbeing after an emergency C-section.""

""Interestingly, while placentas tested from baby boys have more inflammatory gene expression from a vaginal or 'natural' birth, baby girls born in emergency Caesarean section deliveries have more inflammatory markers,"" says senior author Matthew Flinders Professor Claire Roberts, from the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute.

""One explanation for this could be our finding that placentas from baby boys tend to put out 'alarm signals' (known as 'interleukin-33') in times of fetal distress, which we didn't see in the placentas from baby girls. This could help to mitigate the amount of inflammation.""

Overall, assessment of inflammatory gene expression in the placenta could be used to identify babies who have been exposed to higher-than-normal levels of inflammation at birth, and so create incentives to monitor their development and long-term health and wellbeing more closely, the researchers conclude.

RNA sequencing data used in this study was funded by NIH NICHD R01 HD089685-01 'Maternal molecular profiles reflect placental function and development across gestation' PI Prof CT Roberts ('CTR'), a National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant (GNT1174971) to CTR and a Matthew Flinders Professorial Fellowship awarded to CTR and funded by Flinders University.

The changing attitudes bring the U.S. in line with vaccine acceptance in other major countries. For both vaccines and boosters, acceptance was defined in the survey as receiving at least one dose or willingness to take one when available.

France, India, and Nigeria also showed dramatic increases in vaccine acceptance. India, China, and Singapore reported the highest rates of vaccine acceptance, with 98.3% of Indians saying they were vaccinated or willing to do so.

Despite improvement in acceptance rates, the authors expressed concern about global perspectives on boosters, misinformation fueling vaccine hesitancy, and the high rate that people reported using ivermectin, which is commonly used to treat parasites in animals and not approved to treat COVID.

“The most promising finding of the 2022 global survey is that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has continued to rise in most countries studied, reaching 79.1% overall,” the authors wrote. “However, the wide variability of acceptance rates that we report could jeopardize efforts to control the pandemic.”",0

506,"July 25, 2022 – Cannabidiol (CBD) products made from hemp have gotten more popular in recent years. But how much can you trust what the label says, compared to what really is in CBD patches, creams, and lotions? A team of investigators decided to find out. They bought 105 hemp-derived CBD topicals – products designed to be applied to the skin – from physical stores and online sites. Of the 89 labels that list the amount of CBD, for example, 24% matched what was inside; 58% of the products had more CBD; and the remaining 18% contained less. Also, more than a third – 35% – of the topicals tested contained delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), including some that claimed to be THC-free. THC is the compound in marijuana associated with ""getting high."" But hemp products are allowed to contain 0.3% or less THC, and all the products in this study met the regulation. People should ""be wary of cannabinoid products available in retail stores. The products may not contain the amounts of CBD or THC that are advertised,"" says lead study author Tory R. Spindle, PhD. The study was published in JAMA Network Open on July 20. CBD topicals are over-the-counter (OTC) products, so the FDA does not regulate them the same way as prescription medications. But at the same time, the agency does not allow OTC products to make claims about health benefits. ""The health claims made on the products, which are often very pricey, may not be supported by clinical research,"" says Spindle, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Cannabis Science Laboratory in Baltimore. He and colleagues found 28% of the 105 products made a therapeutic claim, mostly about helping ease pain and inflammation. And 14% claimed to help improve skin quality or appearance. ""This study really highlights that current regulatory oversight of cannabinoid products is not sufficient,"" says Spindle, who is also an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. More hemp-derived CBD products are showing up on store shelves and online because of the 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act. This act, more commonly known as the Farm Bill, removed hemp and hemp products from the U.S. controlled substances list.

Despite concerns uncovered in the study, the topical CBD industry appears to be improving, says Adam Friedman, MD. ""The good news is that in the last couple years, in the face of this incredible explosion of CBD-heavy or CBD-only products that have hit the market thanks to the Farm Bill, there does seem to be better quality assurance,"" says Friedman, a professor and chair of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, DC. ""The labeling is improving, but there is still a lot of work to be done given that there is still under- and over-labeling,"" he says. The study authors mention concerns about ingredients in these products absorbing through the skin, entering the body, and causing other effects, such as liver toxicity. But Friedman says it's unlikely most of these CBD topicals would go deeper than the skin's upper layers. ""These are reputable investigators that have published widely in this space, including on this subject. This is a reputable journal. The design is sound, and the limitations are few,” says Jamie Corroon, ND. He found it interesting that products were mislabeled regardless of whether they were sold in brick-and-mortar stores or online. Also, regarding the finding that the products containing THC were all within the 0.3% legal maximum, “this is surprising – and shows good manufacturing practices,” he says. Given these CBD products with THC are applied to the skin, the risk of impairment ""is exceptionally low,"" says Corroon, a licensed naturopathic doctor and founder and medical director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Education in Del Mar, CA. ""The case for topical hemp-derived CBD products is that they are generally safe, accessible, relatively affordable, and lots of people are reporting positive experiences using them,"" he says. Friedman agreed with Spindle and colleagues that incorrect labeling and claims about health benefits on some CBD products are concerning. ""Companies that mislabel and make inappropriate claims … hurt the entire field."" ""There is tremendous potential for this area, especially in dermatology, where we're looking at specific topical agents for utilizing CBD,"" Friedman says. When manufacturers mislead about CBD products, it ""undermines the credibility of this field.""",0

Antigens are molecules that are not part of your body that cause your immune system to react, producing antibodies to fight the invader. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, carries antigens.

Higher antigen levels could mean the virus is reproducing and the disease is more severe, the study authors said. As a result, antigen levels could potentially be used to predict which patients may have a higher risk of more severe COVID-19, as well as who could benefit from certain treatments.

514,"Researchers from Drexel University have uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism in the brain that is essential for making the right kinds of proteins that promote healthy brain function, and its malfunctioning may be an early contributor of the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Brain cells are continuously undergoing changes in response to environmental stimuli and to record new memories. Such complex brain capability relies on the ability of brain cells to generate different functional variants of the same protein using a process known as alternative RNA splicing.

Recent studies have reported defects in RNA splicing of genes in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which has led to the conclusion that splicing disruptions are considered an indicator of Alzheimer's disease. Causes for these splicing disruptions in the brain are still unknown, which has hindered the development of treatments focused on this defect.

The team led by Akanksha Bhatnagar, a PhD student, and Felice Elefant, PhD,a professor, who are biology researchers in Drexel's College of Arts and Sciences, is the first to uncover the role of the Tip60 enzyme in binding to certain RNA in the brain to control how they are spliced.

This function is particularly important, the researchers suggest, because such RNA splicing ultimately generates the protein diversity required for learning and memory and the majority of RNA that Tip60 binds to are encoded by genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease progression.

A 2018 Drexel study by Elefant's lab showed that restoration of the enzyme Tip60 created a balancing of the enzymes in the brain and reversed symptoms in an Alzheimer's model system. Building on that study, Elefant, Bhatnagar, and their team -- whose findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience -- discovered that Tip60 doesn't just regulate gene activation to make RNA, it also regulates the way RNA is spliced to generate diverse protein variants, which has been shown to contribute to the reversal of Alzheimer's symptoms.

""We have previously shown that Tip60 enzyme levels are depleted in Alzheimer's disease brains and this depletion results in some genes getting inactivated. However, with this new RNA splicing function, we now show Tip60 is also not present to bind to the RNA to allow for appropriate splicing in the brain and may be causing some of the splicing defects observed in Alzheimer's disease,"" said Elefant.

The researchers found that restoring depleted amounts of Tip60 in Alzheimer's models, not only rescues gene activation, but also partially protects against splicing disruptions -- demonstrating that the Tip60 enzyme can be a drug target to protect against two different processes that go awry in Alzheimer's.

""RNA is essential in coding, decoding, regulation and the expression of genes,"" said Akanksha Bhatnagar. ""In the Alzheimer's brain, not only is production of RNA being turned off, but also the way the RNA is being assembled to generate proteins is not correct. This is a critical piece in the Alzheimer's disease puzzle that has opened new doors for understanding disease causes.""

The Elefant Lab at Drexel also explores how environmental changes can impact Alzheimer's disease.

""More than 95% of Alzheimer's cases do not have a clear genetic link with parents, they are arising sporadically due to external factors, or epigenetics,"" said Bhatnagar. ""We want to know how and why environmental changes can impact Alzheimer's and one of the ways this can happen is through the enzyme we study, Tip60.""

These findings could lead to important developments for drug design and the treatment of Alzheimer's, according to the team.

""If we can figure out what genes are being altered before deficits occur, there is a possibility that these RNA variations could serve as biomarkers to identify Alzheimer's disease early on,"" said Bhatnagar.

In addition to Bhatnagar and Elefant, Keegan Krick, Bhanu Chandra Karisetty, Ellen Armour and Elizabeth Heller contributed to this research. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the NIH.",0

The study, which was backed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), defined COVID-19-associated deaths broadly to include both direct and indirect pandemic-related causes. Traumatic experiences like the loss of caregivers are associated with increased risks of substance use and mental and chronic health issues. The study estimates that, of the 1.5 million children affected, over 1 million lost a parent or custodial grandparent, with the highest numbers reported from South Africa, Peru, USA, India, Brazil, and Mexico.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reassess the decision in 90 days in case the rule needs to be reinstated because of a new variant, CNN said.

""Currently, fish oil supplements are indicated for patients with elevated plasma triglycerides to reduce cardiovascular risk,"" said study author Dr. Salvatore Carbone of Virginia Commonwealth University, US. ""Due to the high prevalence of elevated triglycerides in the population, they can be commonly prescribed. Of note, low dose omega-3 fatty acids are available over the counter, without the need for a prescription.""

Some clinical trials have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation, the most common heart rhythm disorder. People with the disorder have a five times greater likelihood of having a stroke.

These studies tested different formulations of omega-3 fatty acids at different doses. The authors therefore performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to answer the question of whether fish oils were consistently related to a raised risk for atrial fibrillation.

The analysis included five randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Participants had elevated triglycerides and were either at high risk for cardiovascular disease or had established cardiovascular disease. A total of 50,277 patients received fish oils or placebo and were followed up for between 2 and 7.4 years. The dose of fish oils varied from 0.84 g to 4 g per day.

The researchers found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk for atrial fibrillation compared to placebo with an incidence rate ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.54; p<0.001).

Dr. Carbone said: ""Our study suggests that fish oil supplements are associated with a significantly greater risk of atrial fibrillation in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk. Although one clinical trial indicated beneficial cardiovascular effects of supplementation, the risk for atrial fibrillation should be considered when such agents are prescribed or purchased over the counter, especially in individuals susceptible to developing the heart rhythm disorder.""",0

525,"Consuming carbohydrates with high glycemic index -- an indicator of how quickly a food affects blood glucose levels -- appears to be associated with the risk of coronary heart disease in women but not men, according to a report in the April 12 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.

High-carbohydrate diets increase the levels of blood glucose and of harmful blood fats known as triglycerides while reducing levels of protective HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, thereby increasing heart disease risk, according to background information in the article. However, not all carbohydrates have the same effect on blood glucose levels. The glycemic index is a measure of how much a food raises blood glucose levels compared with the same amount of glucose or white bread. A related measure, the glycemic load, is calculated based on the glycemic index of a given food and also on the total amount of carbohydrates it contains.

Sabina Sieri, Ph.D., of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy, and colleagues studied 47,749 Italian adults -- 15,171 men and 32,578 women -- who completed dietary questionnaires. Based on their responses, the researchers calculated their overall carbohydrate intakes as well as the average glycemic index of the foods they consumed and the glycemic loads of their diets. During a median (midpoint) of 7.9 years of follow-up, 463 participants (158 women and 305 men) developed coronary heart disease.

The one-fourth of women who consumed the most carbohydrates overall had approximately twice the risk of heart disease as the one-fourth who consumed the least. When these carbohydrates were separated into high- and low-glycemic index categories, increased intake from high-glycemic index foods was significantly associated with greater risk of coronary heart disease, whereas low-glycemic index carbohydrates were not. ""Thus, a high consumption of carbohydrates from high-glycemic index foods, rather than the overall quantity of carbohydrates consumed, appears to influence the risk of developing coronary heart disease,"" the authors write.

The one-fourth of women whose diet had the highest glycemic load had 2.24 times the risk of heart disease compared with the one-fourth of women with the lowest glycemic load.

Overall carbohydrate intake, glycemic index and glycemic load were not associated with heart disease risk in men. This could be because the adverse changes associated with carbohydrate intake, including triglyceride levels, are stronger risk factors for heart disease in women than in men, the authors note.

""We tentatively suggest that the adverse effects of a high glycemic diet in women are mediated by sex-related differences in lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, but further prospective studies are required to verify a lack of association of a high dietary glycemic load with cardiovascular disease in men,"" they conclude.",0

527,"One powerful way cancer cells defend against tumor-killing immune cells is to load up their cell surface with a protein known as PD-L1. Now a team of UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers led by Roger S. Lo, MD, PhD, has identified a method to degrade tumor cell-surface PD-L1, thereby making tumors susceptible to immune attack. This approach, in combination with existing therapies, could improve treatment responses of metastatic melanoma and other cancers by suppressing resistance to current therapies.

Lo and his co-authors published their findings Tuesday in the journal Cancer Discovery.

Lo, a professor of medicine (dermatology) and molecular and medical pharmacology at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, and the team at his lab first found that tumor cell-surface PD-L1 is destabilized or degraded by a protein named ITCH. By searching a trove of small molecules at a National Institutes of Health library, they found and deployed a small molecule, which they characterized to be an ITCH activator. By activating ITCH, the small molecule degrades tumor cell-surface PD-L1. This small molecule, when used together with an existing therapy, suppresses relapses of melanoma in animal models.

Reducing the accumulation of PD-L1 clears the path for tumor-killing T-cells to do their work. ""Once ITCH is activated, it's now able to degrade or destabilize tumor surface PD-L1,"" Lo said. ""And once PD-L1 is degraded, then there are more T cells active to help therapies work better.""

Lo and his lab have been focusing on developing mutation-targeted therapy, as common cancer mutations drive disease progression by hyper-activating the so-called MAPK pathway. Therapy targeting the MAPK pathway for patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma is associated with a high rate of response. However, the disease often comes back in a process called acquired resistance, causing clinical relapses.

According to Zhentao Yang, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in Lo's lab, ""In prior work from our group, we found that melanoma cells treated with MAPK-targeted therapy accumulate PD-L1 on their cell surface. So we hypothesized that, if we find the protein whose normal job is to degrade cell-surface PD-L1, then we have the first clue as to how to reduce PD-L1 protein levels in cancers treated with MAPK-targeted therapy.""

In collaboration with another UCLA team led by James Wohlschlegel, PhD, professor of biological chemistry at the David Geffen School of Medicine, Yang identified ITCH as the protein that binds to surface PD-L1 and tags it biochemically for degradation by the tumor cell. In follow-up work, ""We were excited to go further to find a potential path for this knowledge to help patients with cancers. Identification of a small molecule that can activate ITCH became a priority,"" said Yan Wang, a first-year PhD student who joined the Lo Lab from the department of molecular and medical pharmacology.

529,"July 7, 2022 – At first glance, Kyra's Instagram profile looks a lot like that of any other influencer. According to her bio, she's a dream chaser and model. The 22-year-old from Mumbai, India, is thin, light-skinned, and conventionally attractive. She takes bathroom selfies and complains about the hassles of modern airline travel. But there's a catch: She's not real. Kyra is only the latest in a growing number of Instagram influencers generated by artificial intelligence. With only 23 posts, Kyra has already amassed 113,000 followers, a number dwarfed by the online presence of other AI influencers, including Miquela (with 3 million followers), Shudu, Blawko, and Imma. Despite their origins in the imaginations of marketers and programmers, all of the meta–influencers clothe themselves in a thin veneer of authenticity. In a May post on LinkedIn, Kyra's creator, Himanshu Goel, business head at TopSocial India, wrote, ""Since her first post, she has traveled to the mountains, beaches and the forts of Jaipur. She has done a fashion shoot, Valentine's Day interaction with fans and even Yoga! Kyra's journey has just begun and there are many more adventures and secrets to be revealed."" Kyra is a fictional character, made by computer-generated images, who will have a storyline written for her. But to some psychologists, the arrival of AI influencers is the latest in a worrying trend in which social media platforms manipulate the well-being and body image of young people around the world. ""This will create a whole new set of beauty ideals that seem realistic,"" says Sophia Choukas-Bradley, PhD, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. ""And because they are AI-generated, they can be manipulated to be very realistic but showing impossible body standards."" Humans are always comparing themselves to the people around them, says Jasmine Fardouly, PhD, a social psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. And these comparisons are automatic and widespread. ""From a young age, we've internalized this idea that it's really important to be physically attractive because then you'll be successful and happy, and everything wonderful will happen. But these beauty ideals are so specific that very few people can actually attain them,"" she says.

Humans are social, so this makes sense, Fardouly says. The social bonds that have enabled us to thrive as a species also mean that we are constantly comparing ourselves to the people around us to see how we measure up. Just seeing a photo of another person – even a complete stranger – invites comparisons, she says. Advertisers have long used this part of human nature, explains Choukas-Bradley. If we see a photo or video of a person we admire or want to imitate, it's a simple and powerful way to encourage people to buy what that person is selling. In the 1900s, advertisers used celebrities to both create beauty ideals and to sell the products needed to live up to those standards. For most of us, Choukas-Bradley says, these celebrities were removed from our everyday lives. We didn't run into them at the grocery store or see them in grubby sweats without makeup. Still, psychologists have found that the perfect-looking images we saw in the pages of glossy magazines, on TV, and on billboards had a dramatic effect on how people thought about their own bodies. A 1999 survey of 548 tween and teen girls in the journal Pediatrics showed that reading fashion magazines influenced perceptions of the “ideal” body in two-thirds of respondents and made 47% want to lose weight. Another study in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2003 found that girls who frequently read fashion magazines were seven times more likely to diet for weight loss and six times more likely to use extreme, unhealthy weight loss behaviors such as taking diet pills or laxatives. In total, a 2010 review article by body image researcher Michael Levine, PhD, and colleagues showed a consistent, strong relationship between exposure to mass media and negative body image and disordered eating. ""We've come about as close as we can to proving a cause-and-effect relationship between looking at thin, idealized images, and young women in particular feeling worse about their bodies,"" says Jennifer Mills, PhD, a clinical psychologist at York University in Ontario, Canada.

Growing awareness of the harm of mass media images came along with the rise of digital editing programs like Photoshop and with the advent of social media. On one level, says Jennifer Harriger, PhD, a psychologist at Pepperdine University in California, the images seen on social media are an extension of those seen in advertisements. They promote the same beauty ideals and often sell the same products. And although many on social media like to pretend that their photos are spur-of-the-moment snaps, the reality is that most influencers heavily edit their images using Photoshop, digital filters, and more. Not surprisingly, more research is revealing that social media has the same strong links between negative body image and eating disorder behaviors as traditional mass media. What makes social media potentially more tricky, Mills explains, is that the images shown aren't just celebrities, they're also classmates and co-workers. Adding fuel to the fire is that the images are constantly changing and are tailored to each person's interests. ""You could pick up an issue of Cosmo back in the day and another one wouldn't come out for another month, so there was a finite amount of content that you could see. There's an infinite amount on social media,"" she says. This creates what researchers like Choukas-Bradley call a ""perfect storm,"" where images of idealized bodies join with adolescent female culture to emphasize the importance of a body type that is impossible to obtain. ""To me, it's an illustration of the way in which a body has become a source of potential capital and social mobility in our societies,"" says Rachel Rodgers, PhD, a psychologist at Northeastern University in Boston. ""They're not just promoting the idea that you should look like this, but that you could look like that if you only spent the time, money, and energy on the right products and services. That there's a powerful sort of moral obligation to look that way."" Social media whistleblowers such as Frances Haugen – who testified before Congress about how social media sites harm children – have revealed that companies like Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok are well aware of the impact their platforms have on the health and well-being of their youngest users, Harriger explains.

Some countries have tried to address this problem through legislation. In June 2021, Norway's legislature overwhelmingly passed a law requiring influencers and advertisers to post a disclaimer showing when a photo has been digitally altered. Though these disclaimers are well-intentioned, studies have shown they have no effect on our perceptions of the bodies in the photos and on our desires to look like them. The reason is that our brains first process these images via an automatic and emotional pathway. We might not even be aware that we're making these comparisons because they happen so quickly, and without conscious thought, Fardouly explains. We can only process disclaimers later, via a second neural pathway that's slower, taking seconds rather than milliseconds. But by then, the image has already hit home. There is on research on AI influencers, according to Fardouly and Choukas-Bradley. But all the experts who spoke with WebMD said their years of work suggests that the fact that these influencers are computer-generated will have little impact on how we perceive their bodies. ""People will still want to look that way. They will still make comparisons to those images, and this will make them feel bad about themselves,"" Fardouly says. To date, AI influencers like Kyra and Miquela have echoed existing beauty ideals rather than challenging the boundaries of what society calls beautiful. As a result, they further reinforce a narrow range of body shapes and sizes. The fact that they aren't real doesn't make much of a difference. Mills hopes that AI influencers could offer a reprieve for real-life influencers who build their lives around the whims of algorithms and advertisers. ""Being an influencer is really hard. You always have to be doing interesting things and look beautiful. It's the perfect job for an artificially created being because it's not the life of a normal teen,"" Mills says. Digital influencers are also, of course, unpaid, never age the way real-life characters do, and will be free of the kinds of scandals other celebrities can sometimes get mixed up in.",0

532,"June 17, 2022 -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke against COVID-19 vaccines for young children on Thursday, saying that Florida won’t provide state programs to administer vaccines for toddlers or infants.

DeSantis said coronavirus vaccines haven’t gone through enough testing to determine whether they are effective, adding that kids are the least likely to experience serious health consequences from COVID-19, according to Politico.

“I would say we are affirmatively against the COVID vaccine for young kids,” he said during a press conference. “These are the people who have zero risk of getting anything.”

Florida is the only state in the nation that didn’t order new doses of vaccines for children before the FDA decision on Wednesday to approve the Pfizer and Moderna shots for kids under age 5. This week’s approval opened fast-track distribution, and kids could begin receiving shots as soon as Tuesday, Politico reported.

The FDA, CDC, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and the Mayo Clinic have stressed that the vaccines are safe and have urged people to get vaccinated to protect against the virus.

535,"Aug. 16, 2022 -- A growing bandwagon of TikTok influencers has been using and promoting calamine lotion as a makeup primer under foundation. While this may work as a base layer for some people, dermatologists have concerns about this trend, particularly the risk of dryness. As of Aug. 12, the # calamine lotion tag had more than 20.8 million views on TikTok, with hundreds of videos hailing the cream for its opaque pink tint and matte effect when used under foundation. Calamine lotion has been used to treat itchy rashes, insect bites, and pain from chickenpox and poison ivy for years. It’s sold over the counter and is a common treatment for skin discomfort, says Doris Day, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. It is also on the World Health Organization’s list of essential drugs, she says. “This is something that has been around for a long time. It’s recognized as a drug that has importance. So every now and then I guess somebody comes across it and says it’s a ‘new panacea’ for something, but it’s really not. It’s just an old-time simple product.” Calamine lotion is made of ferric oxide and zinc oxide, which gives it its antiseptic and anti-itch properties, in addition to its characteristic pink color. Zinc oxide is also commonly used in mineral sunscreens, Day says. Though these ingredients are safe with temporary, localized use, high concentrations and chronic use of calamine lotion can be irritating to the skin, says Pooja Sodha, MD, director of the Center for Laser and Cosmetic Dermatology at George Washington University in Washington, DC. At these high concentrations, calamine lotion can be drying, which may cause skin clumping and can be abrasive, says Sodha. She also cautions that the astringent properties of the zinc and the high pH may disrupt proteins on the skin, which breaks down the skin's natural defenses. Using calamine lotion all over the face daily can “potentially damage your skin barrier to a point where you're going to have to do a lot of extra work ... to bring it back.""

Day also worries about this trend resulting in dry skin. Even in situations where using calamine lotion is appropriate, like treating poison ivy, its drying effects can sometimes irritate the skin. And dry skin can be more than an aesthetic issue: It can lead to breaks in the skin, which can result in infections and scarring, she says. While this may not occur in someone with extremely oily skin, most people don’t have extremely oily skin, says Day, so this will be ineffective at best and damaging at worst. If someone is looking for a good makeup base layer, Sodha recommends something that's non-comedogenic and non-sensitizing, like silicon-based primers. “The great thing about these products is that they are non-comedogenic, so they won't clog your pores. They're synthetic, so they're not going to cause some sort of allergy,” she says. In general, both dermatologists warn their patients to be wary of the TikTok trends they see online and caution about possible effects with long-term use of calamine lotion on the face, even if it appears to work with one use. “Consumers have to think about this like they do with any sort of product that they come across, just thinking about the long-term effects of something like this and how it works for their own skin,” says Sodha.",0
536,"Forensic science includes the analysis of blood backspatter involved in gunshot wounds, but scientific questions about the detailed role of fluids in these situations remained unresolved.

To search for answers about how blood droplets from a gunshot wound can reverse direction while in flight, University of Illinois at Chicago and Iowa State University researchers explored the influence of propellant gases on blood backspatter.

In Physics of Fluids, from AIP Publishing, the researchers report using numeric modeling to capture the behavior of gun muzzle gases and predict the reversal of blood droplet flight, which was captured experimentally. Their experiments also show the breakup of blood droplets, a future extension of their modeling efforts.

Propellant gases from gunpowder issue from the gun barrel at high speed and form turbulent vortex rings, which can be visualized by high-speed shadowgraph images, like those used to capture flow structures of supersonic aircraft or spacecraft.

A penetrating bullet tends to spatter blood droplets from the victim backward, toward the shooter, but a turbulent vortex ring of muzzle gases moving from the shooter toward the victim can reverse the flight of the droplets.

The researchers' prior work focused on modeling the trajectories of blood droplets that lead to bloodstains that end up being analyzed by forensics experts.

""We used proper fluid dynamics models for the aerodynamic drag, which led to significant improvements, but concluded muzzle gases should also be included and can dramatically alter the formation and size of blood droplets,"" said Alexander Yarin, a distinguished professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

In their most recent work, the researchers identified an additional feature at play beyond deflection and reversal of blood spatter back toward the victim: the secondary breakup of formed droplets in flight, identified by James Michael's group at Iowa State University.

""We concluded that forensic analysis of formed bloodstains should account for additional uncertainty in the trajectories of droplets, if muzzle gas interactions are present for short-range shooting,"" said Yarin. ""And while determination of the origin of droplets is often a desirable outcome of forensic analysis, muzzle gas interactions can confound interpretation.""

The researchers' imaging results made it clear ""the size of droplets can be dramatically impacted through the secondary breakup induced by the muzzle gas wind,"" said Yarin. ""We're working to analyze this behavior using bloodstain patterns with Drs. James Michael and Daniel Attinger and their team at Iowa State University.""",0

538,"Conditions such as loud noise and few trees in neighborhoods seem to affect how much sleep adolescents get, according to a study in the journal Sleep. In a second study, researchers measured young people’s brainwaves to observe the troublesome effects of sleep loss on memory and cognitive function.

The findings were reported by two scientific teams funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about six out of 10 (57.8%) middle school students and seven out of 10 (72.7%) high school students in the United States do not get the recommended amount of sleep on school nights, increasing their risk for future chronic disease development. Studies have shown a link between insufficient sleep and a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, and increased risk-taking behaviors in adolescents.

In the new residential environment study, which involved 110 adolescents, the researchers found that just small increases in neighborhood noise had a negative effect on sleep. In scientific terms, each standard deviation above average noise levels was linked to a 16-minute delay in falling sleep and 25% lower odds of sleeping at least eight hours per night. When the researchers looked at the effects of green space, however, they found that the teens who lived in neighborhoods with just one standard deviation above the average number of trees fell asleep 18 minutes earlier and experienced more favorable sleep times overall.

“For adolescents, the harms of insufficient sleep are wide-ranging and include impaired cognition and engagement in antisocial behavior,” said study author Stephanie L. Mayne, Ph.D., assistant professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania. “This makes identifying strategies to prevent and treat the problem critical. Our findings suggest that neighborhood noise and green space may be important targets for interventions.”

To record their sleep times and duration, the students in Mayne’s study wore wrist actigraphy watches for 14 days in both eighth and ninth grades. Their home addresses were mapped to show sound levels, tree canopy cover, and housing and population density. The researchers then considered sex, race, parental education, household income and size, and neighborhood poverty to reach their conclusions.

In the second study, a team of researchers at the University of California (UC) Sleep Lab in Davis showed how sleep loss associated with reduced time in bed affected the brain waves of 77 adolescents aged 10 to 16. This study was part of the lab’s longitudinal investigation of brain changes in adolescence, as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG).

The researchers predefined three different sleep schedules – four consecutive nights of seven, 8.5 or 10 hours of time in bed – and participants adhered to one of them each year. They slept with electrodes attached to their scalps to capture brain activity.

“Modest sleep restriction produced strong changes in the brain waves, which may explain how sleep loss impairs adolescents’ cognitive function,” said study author Ian G. Campbell, Ph.D., a professor in UC Davis’s psychiatry and behavioral sciences department. “We were surprised by the magnitude of the effect.”

Reducing time in bed from 10 to seven hours for four consecutive nights decreased sleep duration on the fourth night by 23%, but all-night sigma activity, which is important in memory consolidation and cognitive performance, went down by 40%.

During sleep, the brain replays, analyzes information, learns, and restores itself, all processes that sustain physical and mental health and overall performance. According to the researchers, the EEG changes in response to even modest reductions of the adolescents’ time in bed indicate insufficient sleep recovery.

“These two studies provide a snapshot of the research we fund to understand the harms of sleep deficiency and its causes,” said Marishka Brown, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research, NHLBI. “They contribute objectively measured evidence of how modifiable environmental factors, such as housing and neighborhood conditions, impair sleep in adolescents and how that lack of sleep can literally be seen on the brain.”

539,"Two studies have revealed that certain disorders of the CAPRIN1 gene have significant consequences for people. First, the research team showed that insufficient production of the protein CAPRIN1 in the brain can lead to developmental differences, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and language disorders. Furthermore, the scientists identified a specific mutation in the CAPRIN1 gene (CAPRIN1P512L) that leads to an abnormal accumulation of proteins, causing unsteady gait and muscle weakness (myasthenia). The two studies have been published in the journals Brain and Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences.

These new insights were made possible by exome analyses, in which scientists observe which genes are altered in a cell. The team also used the GeneMatcher database -- a platform on which researchers and physicians exchange information about mutations in genes and diseases associated with them.

The research team identified twelve patients who had mutations in the CAPRIN1 gene. In them, only half of the amount of protein was produced. Lisa Pavinato, a doctoral researcher in the team of Professor Dr Alfredo Brusco at the University of Turin and DAAD-scholarship holder with Professor Dr Brunhilde Wirth at the University of Cologne, discovered a connection between the deficient production of the protein and certain neurological impairments. The affected persons all had speech disorders, 82 per cent had ADHD, and 67 per cent were affected by autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The function of CAPRIN1 was confirmed in laboratory experiments with human induced pluripotent stem cells in which the CAPRIN1 gene was switched off using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, creating the conditions from which the affected individuals suffered. Cells with a CAPRIN1 mutation develop shortened processes and faulty circuits that show reduced electrical activity compared to the healthy neurons without the mutation. In contrast, control neurons without the CAPRIN1 mutation form long processes, developing into complex networks. Furthermore, the team also discovered changes in translation, one of the most important cellular processes for error-free cell formation and function. In fact, due to the faulty translation, the mutant neurons began to degenerate and form clumps after a few days. The results of this research have been published in the article 'CAPRIN1 haploinsufficiency causes a neurodevelopmental disorder with language impairment, ADHD and ASD' in Brain.

In the second study, GeneMatcher was used to identify three children from different families with a newly developed point mutation at a specific position of the CAPRIN1 gene: an amino acid exchange from proline to leucine at position 512. All three children show the same symptoms of early-onset movement disorders (ataxia), impaired speech motor skills (dysarthria), memory disorders, and myasthenia. Andrea delle Vedove, a doctoral researcher in the team of Professor Wirth, showed that this specific mutation leads to many protein clumps in neuronal cells similar to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's or ataxia. In addition, the activity of the nerve cells was reduced. The study 'CAPRIN1P512L causes aberrant protein aggregation and associates with early-onset ataxia' has appeared in Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences.

'The new research results are important not only for the affected patients and their families, who often spend years searching for answers to understand the cause of their disease, but also for physicians, who can now make faster and more accurate diagnoses,' said Professor Dr Brunhilde Wirth, Director of the Institute of Human Genetics at University Hospital Cologne, who led the studies together with national and international teams.",0
540,"A new analysis, funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has found that personalized kidney disease screening for those with type 1 diabetes (T1D) could reduce the time that chronic kidney disease (CKD) goes undetected and lower costs. Currently, CKD screening recommendations call for annual urinary albumin excretion rate testing for those who have had T1D for more than five years. However, the new findings suggest that testing frequency could be personalised to reduce burden and cost, with those at high risk for CKD being tested more frequently to detect the disease earlier. The study analysed over 30 years of data from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study group and identified three levels of CKD risk to be associated with later CKD diagnosis. Those who are at high risk for developing CKD with a HbA1c of at least 9% and AER of 21-30 mg/24 hours could be screened every six months, and those at lower risk could be screened every two years. The findings support a trend towards personalized medicine.

542,"As the current COVID-19 crisis has shown, the disruptions that occur when transportation cannot proceed as usual are system-wide, affecting individual lives, companies, and the global economy. Now imagine a similar problem inside your brain and spinal cord. A new study led by researchers from Osaka University and National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry reports that two common neurodegenerative diseases -- ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD -- result from reduced transportation of RNA by the protein TDP-43, which ultimately disrupts neuron function.

Because one of the biggest physiological changes in both ALS and FTLD is the disappearance of TDP-43 from the nucleoli of neurons, the team focused their research on finding out what TDP-43 normally does. TDP-43 is known to bind to RNA, and the team's first experiment showed that in neurons, TDP-43 attaches to RNA that codes for pieces of ribosomes, which are necessary for making proteins from RNA code.

At its core, transportation gets things where they need to be at the proper time, whether they're people, goods, or molecules. In the body, items being sent from one place to another are often a response to what's happening to you. For instance, in response to dehydration, your brain sends a hormone through your blood to the kidneys where it forces water to be reabsorbed. In cells like neurons, the situation is similar, but there are no roads or arteries. Instead, many molecules get to their destination by being carried by other molecules.

""We discovered TDP-43 in axons and that it binds to ribosomal protein messenger RNA,"" says first author Seiichi Nagano. ""That was strong support for the idea that TDP-43 carries the RNA to the axon where it can be used to make ribosomal proteins. This would allow local synthesis of proteins at ribosomes built in axons."" Indeed, further experiments confirmed that hypothesis and showed that when TDP-43 was missing, the RNA in question could not be transported to the axon.

But what happens if the RNA cannot be transported? The researchers examined axon growth in culture as well as in mouse embryos. They found that in both cases, axon extension and outgrowth were stunted when TDP-43 was missing. However, outgrowth could be restored by forcing the neurons to overproduce ribosomal proteins.

""Now that we understand TDP-43's role in transporting the ribosomal protein messenger RNA, it should help us develop new strategies and new targets for ALS and FTLD treatments,"" says co-author of the study Hideki Mochizuki. ""Our results in reversing stunted axon extension in mouse embryos is promising, but is just a first step.""",0

544,"Oct. 27, 2022 – For the first time, the World Health Organization has published a list of 19 fungi it says pose a great threat to public health. The authors of the report said a primary goal of the list's creation is to draw attention to the need for more worldwide coordinated work in overcoming increasing treatment resistance. “Fungal pathogens are a major threat to public health as they are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment with only four classes of antifungal medicines currently available, and few candidates in the clinical pipeline,” the WHO explained in its release of the newly named “fungal priority pathogens list.” Of the 19 fungi on the list, four were ranked at the top as “critical”:
• None can infect people who breathe it in and is most common in people with weakened immune systems.
• None , which flourished in ICUs and lurked in breathing tubes during the pandemic,
• None is a common mold that most people breathe every day without getting sick, but it can be dangerous for people with lung diseases or weakened immune systems,
• None is a yeast that commonly causes thrush and vaginal yeast infections, according to the

Researchers explained that the rankings were determined, in order of importance, by public health impact, treatment resistance, and gaps in knowledge about a pathogen. Those most at risk of being impacted by fungi on the list are those with cancer, HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, chronic respiratory disease, or post-primary tuberculosis infection, the WHO said. Global warming, as well as increasing levels of travel and trade, are largely behind the growing ""incidence and geographic range of fungal diseases,"" the WHO said. But ""despite the growing concern, fungal infections receive very little attention and resources, leading to a scarcity of quality data on fungal disease distribution and antifungal resistance patterns. As a result, the exact burden of fungal diseases and antifungal resistance, are unknown, and the response is therefore undermined."" The organization urged ""coordinated action"" between countries across the world to increase surveillance and response to these fungi. ""We need more data and evidence on fungal infections and antifungal resistance to inform and improve response to these priority fungal pathogens,"" said Haileyesus Getahun, MD, director of AMR global coordination at the WHO, in a statement.“Countries are encouraged to follow a stepwise approach, starting with strengthening their fungal disease laboratory and surveillance capacities, and ensuring equitable access to existing quality therapeutics and diagnostics, globally.""",0
545,"The types of food eaten in an effort to cut down on saturated fat may make a difference in reducing heart disease risk, according to a study of people with either high blood pressure or prehypertension. The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a part of the National Institutes of Health.

Investigators evaluated three diets that follow the principles of NHLBI’s DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan with some modifications. One diet emphasized carbohydrates, another diet emphasized protein, and the third emphasized monounsaturated fat. They reported that while all three diets lowered blood pressure, improved cholesterol levels, and reduced ten-year risk of heart disease by as much as 16 to 21 percent, two of these modified diets were even more effective in reducing some risk factors and estimated risk for heart disease than the diet richer in carbohydrates.

The Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease (OmniHeart) study will be presented today in Dallas at the American Heart Association annual conference, and also published in the November 15 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

These new OmniHeart study results do not represent new guidelines for healthy eating and the proportions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all three diets are all within the ranges recommended by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other national public health organizations. Earlier in 2005, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services incorporated NHLBI’s DASH eating plan as one option within the U.S. Dietary Guidelines.

All of the studied diets are a vast improvement over the typical American diet which can be high in saturated fat and low in essential nutrients, according to NHLBI Director Elizabeth G. Nabel, M.D.

“This study builds on an established body of evidence that shows following a dietary pattern lower in saturated fat, such as the DASH eating plan, can go a long way toward improving overall heart health. With these new data, we have been able to incorporate even more flexibility into the DASH eating plan by providing additional options for people seeking to improve their heart health through healthier eating,” said Nabel.

The study results reinforce the health benefits of following a DASH-type eating plan and suggests that tweaking certain components within that plan — protein and unsaturated fat — may yield benefits for specific risk factors. Compared with the study diet containing more carbohydrates, the diet with greater protein:

The diet with more unsaturated fat, primarily monounsaturated fat:

* lowered blood pressure and triglycerides,

* raised HDL, and

* did not lower LDL.

By providing all daily meals to 164 men and women for 41 days for each diet, researchers evaluated the three diets to determine whether replacing calories from saturated fat with calories from protein or unsaturated fat was better than replacing those calories with carbohydrate. Saturated fat is known to raise blood cholesterol, and public health officials recommend that it make up less than 10 percent of daily calories for healthy individuals and less than 7 percent of daily calories for individuals with heart disease risk factors.

Participants were age 30 or older and had either high blood pressure or prehypertension at the time of enrollment.

“These new findings open the door to further research on the diets’ long-term effects and the ability of people to follow these diets,” said Eva Obarzanek, Ph.D., NHLBI research nutritionist and study co-author.

The OmniHeart study diets differed from each other in several ways:

* The diet emphasizing carbohydrates contained 58 percent of calories from carbohydrates and 15 percent of calories from protein. In addition, it contained 21 percent of calories from unsaturated fat. The other two diets reduced carbohydrate to 48 percent of calories.

* The diet emphasizing protein increased the protein to 25 percent of calories. To increase protein, mostly plant sources, such as beans and nuts, were used, although poultry, egg substitutes, and fat-free or low-fat milk products were also used. Like the carbohydrate diet, it contained 21 percent of calories from unsaturated fat.

* The diet emphasizing unsaturated fat used primarily fats and oils rich in monounsaturated fat, like olive oil, to increase unsaturated fat to 31 percent of calories. Like the carbohydrate diet, it contained 15 percent of calories from protein.

“Our results emphasize the impact that diet can have on blood pressure and cholesterol levels, two of the major heart disease risk factors,” said Lawrence Appel, M.D., M.P.H., of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and lead investigator of the OmniHeart study.

The OmniHeart study did not address other types of diets such as the Atkins or Mediterranean diet.

The OmniHeart study was conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The first participants started the protocol in 2003, and the last participants ended the study in June 2005.

NHLBI has long recommended changes in lifestyle, including following a heart healthy eating plan to reduce risk factors for heart disease. The DASH eating plan was developed through a series of clinical studies that showed that a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and whole grains substantially reduced blood pressure and had other beneficial effects. The eating plan also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts and is low in saturated fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sweets and added sugars.

The new DASH Eating Plan menus are included in the book A Healthier You published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This newly released book is based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.",0
546,"NIH-funded study in mice merits further investigation as a potential treatment.

A specific strain of a common bacteria found in most people with alcoholic hepatitis correlates with greater liver disease severity and mortality, according to a new study published in Nature. Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious form of alcohol-associated liver disease, and people with it have high levels of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) in their gut. The study also found that a novel therapeutic approach that specifically targets the E. faecalis strain lessened alcohol-associated liver disease in mice. The research team was funded in part by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), of the National Institutes of Health.

“This is a hopeful advance against a potentially life-threatening disease for which few effective treatments are available,” said NIAAA Director Dr. George F. Koob. “Alcoholic hepatitis has a mortality rate of more than 50% within the first 60 days of diagnosis in severe cases and is a particularly important area of focus for NIAAA. The current findings warrant further investigation as a potential novel treatment for people with alcoholic hepatitis.”

A multitude of bacteria populate the human digestive tract, and this gut microbiota plays important roles in maintaining health. With chronic alcohol misuse, the levels and types of bacteria in the gut microbiota change which contributes along with other factors to alcohol-associated liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis.

In analyses of gut microbes from alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with alcoholic hepatitis, a team of scientists led by Bernd Schnabl, M.D., of the University of California, San Diego, found that fecal samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis had about 2,700-fold more E. faecalis than samples from non-AUD controls. Further studies of E. faecalis, showed that cytolysin, a toxin secreted by specific E. faecalis strains, killed liver cells and caused liver damage in a mouse model of alcohol-associated liver disease.

“We detected cytolysin-positive E. faecalis (cytolytic E. faecalis) in fecal samples from 30% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and in none of the fecal samples from non-AUD controls,” said Dr. Schnabl. “Importantly, 89% of cytolysin-positive patients with alcoholic hepatitis died within 180 days after admission compared to only about 4% of cytolysin-negative patients.”

In another series of experiments, the researchers studied mice that had been transplanted with feces from the intestines of people with alcoholic hepatitis and that contained cytolytic E. faecalis. They confirmed that transplantation of the bacteria caused severe liver disease in mice. Dr. Schnabl and his colleagues then investigated the therapeutic potential of bacteria-killing viruses known as bacteriophages that specifically target cytolytic E. faecalis.

Using a mouse model of alcohol-associated liver disease, mice were transplanted with stool from cytolysin-positive alcoholic hepatitis patients and treated with a cocktail of bacteriophages targeting the cytolytic E. faecalis strains. The researchers found that mice treated with bacteriophages that target cytolytic E. faecalis had less liver injury and inflammation compared to controls. Administration of E. faecalis-targeting bacteriophage also significantly reduced levels of cytolysin in the liver.

“Taken together, our findings link cytolytic E. faecalis with worse clinical outcomes and mortality in humans with alcoholic hepatitis, and that bacteriophages can specifically target cytolytic E. faecalis in a mouse model of alcohol-induced liver disease,” said Dr. Schnabl. “A prospective clinical trial is required to validate the human relevance of our findings and to test whether this new therapeutic approach is effective for patients with alcoholic hepatitis.”

Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. More than 408 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through October 18, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 8,878 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it's unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event--blood clots with low platelets--which has caused deaths

550,"Front-line physicians who cared for COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in New York City and New Orleans reported multiple factors that contributed to their occupational stress during this extraordinarily trying time in their careers.

These included individual-level factors such as age, work experience and life stage; institutional-level factors such as resource disparities, institutional type and size, and policies; professional-level factors such as informal rationing and medical uncertainty; and societal-level factors such as the federal response, COVID politics, and social inequalities.

At this point in the pandemic, it's well recognized that burnout is pervasive in medicine,"" said Mara Buchbinder, PhD, professor and vice chair in the UNC Department of Social Medicine and lead author of the new study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

""What is less well understood is how deeply entrenched it is in health systems stress. Physicians are sick of being told to heal themselves through yoga and mindfulness when the underlying systems are broken.""

Study authors conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 40 physicians from 14 hospitals in New York City and 39 physicians from 9 hospitals in New Orleans. All had spent at least 4 weeks providing inpatient COVID-19 care beginning in March 2020, when both cities were experiencing the first surge of the pandemic in the United States.

The stressors most frequently cited by the physicians during their interviews included:
• Concerns about being exposed to COVID-19 and/or transmitting it to their family
• The volume and burden of patient deaths
• Medical uncertainty over how to care for COVID-19 patients

""The experience of responding to a public health emergency on this massive scale also created opportunities for innovative approaches to problem-solving by physicians and teams, and prompted hospital management to relieve the frontline of administrative burdens,"" said Nancy Berlinger, PhD, a research scholar at The Hastings Center and a co-author of this study.

""Going forward, hospitals should continue to listen to the frontline for insights about work environments that support clinician integrity and wellbeing and promote better outcomes for patients.""

The study concludes that interventions to reduce physician stress and burnout may be more effective if they target systems factors and stressors, including organizational culture and team dynamics.

553,"The Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center recently opened a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored, phase II clinical study for certain sub-types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The study is based on research from VCU Massey Cancer Center as well as other centers suggesting that combining two novel, recently approved drugs that have shown effectiveness in certain blood cancers may be active in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma. The study is intended for patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with other regimens.

Other NCI centers participating in this novel lymphoma study through the NCI’s Southeast Phase II Consortium include H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (Tampa, Fla.), which is the coordinating center; the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (Chapel Hill, N.C.); and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (Nashville, Tenn.). Also planning to participate are Montefiore-Einstein Cancer Center (New York); and New York Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical College, both of which are in the NCI-sponsored New York Phase II Consortium.

The investigators hope to learn whether these types of lymphoma respond to treatment with the combination of bortezomib, marketed as Velcade, and vorinostat, marketed as Zolinza. They also intend to learn about the side effects of this drug regimen and whether certain features of these lymphomas might predict for response to this regimen.

Steven Grant, M.D., principal investigator of the study and associate director for translational research at VCU Massey Cancer Center, is among a number of researchers worldwide who have reported synergistic interactions between proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat in leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. Other cancer centers are currently exploring this drug combination in patients with refractory multiple myeloma.

“Phase I data from studies in patients with multiple myeloma have given us a good idea of safe and appropriate doses of these two agents when they are administered in combination. Such information has allowed us to open this as a Phase II study in patients with lymphoma to determine how effective this novel drug combination is in this setting,” said Grant. “The hematologic cancer research community has considerable interest in combination regimens incorporating these two important classes of new agents.”

Within the mantle cell lymphoma patient group, the study will assess whether patients who have previously received bortezomib respond differently from those who have never been treated with bortezomib. Bortezomib administered alone has recently been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, and previously was approved for patients with progressive multiple myeloma. Vorinostat has been approved for use in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — cancer of the immune system — that is usually fast-growing. It is the most common type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and is characterized by rapidly growing tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow or other organs. Other symptoms include fever, night sweats and weight loss. There are several subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a fast-growing type of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It is marked by small- to medium-size cancer cells that may be in the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, and gastrointestinal system.",0
554,"Scientists have taken a significant step forward in the search to find effective new drug candidates for the treatment of motor neuron disease.

Researchers from the Universities of Liverpool (UK) and Nagoya (Japan) have shown that a Selenium-based drug-molecule called ebselen and a number of other novel compounds developed at Liverpool can change many of the toxic characteristics of a protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which causes some cases of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease.

The study is published in the journal EBioMedicine.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease which affects motor neurons and the neuronal links between our brain and our muscles. Over the course of the disease these nerve links die, and the patient becomes paralysed, with the majority dying within 2 to 5 years of diagnosis. Around 20% of the familial ALS cases arise from dominant mutations in the sod1 gene. Aggregation of mutant SOD1 protein in familial cases and of wild-type SOD1 in at least some sporadic ALS cases is one of the known causes of the disease. Riluzole, approved in 1995 and edaravone in 2017 remain the only drugs with limited therapeutic benefits.

Stabilisation of the original SOD structure is seen as a key strategy to avoid aggregation. The team have developed a number of ebselen-based compounds with improvements in SOD1 stabilisation and in vitro therapeutic effects with significantly better potency than edaravone. Structure-activity relationship of hits has been guided by high resolution structures of ligand-bound A4V SOD1, a mutant which causes the most severe disease. They were also able to show clear disease onset delay of ebselen in a transgenic ALS model mouse, holding encouraging promise for potential therapeutic compounds.

Professor Samar Hasnain, who led the international team of interdisciplinary experts said: ""The fact that this new generation of organo-selenium compounds have better in vitro neuroprotective activity than edaravone holds a significance promise for the potential of this class of compounds as an alternative therapeutic agent for ALS treatment.

""The ability of these compounds to target cysteine 111 in SOD may have wider therapeutic applications targeting cysteines of enzymes involved in pathogenic and viral diseases including the main protease of SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19).""

Professor Paul O'Neill, who lead the medicinal chemistry programme said: ""Our medicinal chemistry approach, guided by protein-ligand crystallography studies, focused on the design of ebselen based analogues that have improved in vitro potency coupled with excellent predicted CNS exposure and improved solubility and metabolic stability characteristics. By employing this multi-parameter optimisation approach to drug design, the next key stage will be to screen our next generation compounds in appropriate disease models.""

Professor Koji Yamanaka, a physician-neuroscientist at Nagoya University, said: ""It is very encouraging that a number of these novel Selenium compounds exhibited better in vitro neuroprotection in mouse neuronal cells than edaravone. In vivo disease onset delay by ebselen has been demonstrated for the first time in ALS mouse model and further improvement can be expected from the new novel compounds in view of their improved in vitro protection. Choices are very limited for a current ALS therapy, therefore, we are excited to take a significant step forward for developing a new class of drug candidate for ALS.""",0

It's important to remember that VAERS collects reports of things that happen after vaccination, but not necessarily because of vaccination. That means the number of reports will be affected by the number of people being vaccinated. In 2021 approximately 180,000 people in the USA received a COVID vaccine in pregnancy, compared to almost none in 2020. Patients and doctors also tend to report more events to VAERS when a vaccine is new, which means that more adverse events will be captured for COVID vaccines than for older vaccines. For example, in the first two years that the HPV vaccine was available, there were 269 post-vaccine pregnancy losses reported to VAERS, compared to 29 in the most recent two years. Note that the numbers are much lower for HPV vaccine since this is largely given to teenagers, in contrast to the COVID vaccine, which was given to all adults, including those who are already pregnant.

562,"Substance abuse among U.S. adolescents is diminishing, except for an uptake in cannabis and vaping use, according to a new study at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. The findings show that low social engagement and participation in structured activities seemed to be the overall best predictors of substance abuse avoidance. The results are published online in the journal Substance Use and Misuse.

Examining data from 536,291 adolescents between 1991-2019, a team of researchers suggest that while the reasons for this phenomenon are not entirely clear they appear to correlate to a number of other social factors. These include increased parental monitoring and decreased partying and dating notable among them.

According to lead author, Noah Kreski, MPH, in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School, a number of demographic factors seem to correlate to increased substance abuse even today.

""Substance use prevalence decreases across decades were largest for the groups defined by significant paid employment or high levels of social time, either with low engagement in other activities or lower levels of supervision, though these groups had the highest initial prevalence of each variety of substance use,"" says Kreski.

Using data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)'s Monitoring the Future survey the researchers tracked trends in use of cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis, vaping of both nicotine and cannabis, and other substances for school-age student in grades 8 (13-14 years-old), 10 (15-16 years-old) and 12 (17-18 years old), and cross-referenced these habits against demographic factors such as level of social engagement, participation in structured activities, level of adult supervision, and employment. They further analyzed these patterns across race, sex, parental education along with other demographics.

Conversely, substance abuse was higher overall in the highly social and highly engaged groups with less supervision. Time at a paid job was also a significant factor in increasing the chances of trying illicit substances.

Cannabis use increased among all groups, but especially among adolescent workers. Nicotine vaping increased the most among the highly social and engaged group that was less supervised, and cannabis vaping increased most among social but disengaged teens.

""Social settings where adolescents interact with peers, at parties, for example, provide opportunities for substance use, especially in the absence of adult supervision,"" Kreski says. ""These social settings may produce peer pressure for adolescents to engage in substance use in order to fit in.""

This may be particularly true of employed adolescents, who regularly interact with older teens and adults. Employed adolescents often come from lower income brackets and are thus propelled into an early ""pseudoadulthood,"" leading them to adopt the habits more typical of people older than they are. Further, cannabis users in particular appear to seek out other cannabis users, leading to social circles in which the drug plays a significant role. Vaping was similarly correlated to social influence.
• 15 percent of adolescents smoked cigarettes in the past month
• 9 percent reported past-month use of other substances

In summary, Kreski noted: ""Uncovering these links between complex patterns of time use and substance use outcomes could reveal new opportunities for intervention and education of adolescents surrounding substances, helping to promote declines in use.

""Taken together, while the prevalence of substance use varied drastically between the groups, the trends in substance use tended to be relatively consistent across groups. Further research is now needed to investigate the factors driving these universal trends in adolescent substance use.""

The authors suggest that a variety of peer-led and community-based programs may be effective in diminishing use across a broad spectrum of adolescent demographics. They urge further examination of mental health conditions that may lead to substance abuse.

570,"Aug. 15, 2022 – The monkeypox virus has been confirmed in a pet dog, and it most likely spread from owners who had the virus, according to a new case report in The Lancet. Before now, health experts hadn’t known whether pets can catch the virus. Although it spreads from animals to humans and has been found in wild animals, there haven’t been documented cases of human-to-animal spread in pets. As of now, the theory is that any mammal can potentially catch and spread the virus to other mammals. In June, the CDC issued recommendations for people with monkeypox to avoid contact with their pets until they recover. In this report, two men in France got monkeypox and were careful to isolate their dog from other pets and humans as soon as their symptoms started. But the dog continued to sleep in their bed. Two weeks later, the 4-year-old greyhound had the bumps typically seen with monkeypox and tested positive for the virus. DNA analysis of monkeypox samples from the dog and one of the owners showed a 100% sequence homology, which means they were almost certainly connected. Both samples contained virus from the hMPXV-1 clade, lineage B.1, which is the subtype that has been spreading across the U.S. and Europe since April. In Paris, where the owners live, the strain has infected more than 1,700 people. “To the best of our knowledge, the kinetics of symptom onset in both patients and, subsequently, in their dog suggest human-to-dog transmission of monkeypox virus,” the case report authors wrote. “Given the dog’s skin and mucosal lesions as well as the positive monkeypox virus PCR results from anal and oral swabs, we hypothesize a real canine disease, not a simple carriage of the virus by close contact with humans or airborne transmission,” they wrote. This means that monkeypox in pets should be treated as a potentially serious disease, they concluded, stressing the importance of isolating animals when a human becomes infected. “Infected people should not take care of exposed pets,” according to the CDC recommendations. “The person with monkeypox should avoid close contact with the exposed animal, and when possible, ask another household member to care for the animal until the person with monkeypox is fully recovered.”

If owners must care for their pets while isolating at home, they should wash their hands and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after caring for the pets, the CDC says. People with monkeypox should also cover their skin rashes and lesions with long sleeves, long pants, and gloves and wear a well-fitting mask while caring for their pets. But owners shouldn’t put a mask on their pets. Owners who become infected should also make sure that their pets can’t accidentally come into contact with contaminated items in the home, such as clothing, sheets, and towels that have been used by the person with monkeypox. Food, toys, and pet bedding also shouldn’t encounter an uncovered rash or skin lesions. The CDC noted that owners shouldn’t surrender, euthanize, or abandon their pets due to potential exposure. Owners also shouldn’t wipe or bathe their pets with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other surface cleaners. Although scientists don’t know all the symptoms of monkeypox infection in pets, owners should watch for potential signs of illness, including lack of energy or appetite, coughing, a runny or crusty nose, bloating, fever, bumps, and blister-like skin rashes. Owners can get their pet tested if the animal gets symptoms and has had close contact with a person who has a probable or confirmed monkeypox case. More than 31,700 monkeypox cases have been reported in 89 countries, including 31,400 cases in 82 countries that don’t typically report the virus, according to the latest CDC data. The U.S. has reported more than 11,000 cases, followed by Spain with more than 5,000 cases and Germany and the U.K. with nearly 3,000 cases each. In the U.S., New York has reported the highest number of cases, with more than 2,200, according to the latest CDC data.

574,"Scientists looking to understand the fundamental brain mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder have found that a gene mutation known to be associated with the disorder causes an overstimulation of brain cells far greater than that seen in neuronal cells without the mutation.

The Rutgers-led study, spanning seven years, employed some of the most advanced approaches available in the scientific toolbox, including growing human brain cells from stem cells and transplanting them into mouse brains.

The work illustrates the potential of a new approach to studying brain disorders, scientists said.

Describing the study in the journal, Molecular Psychiatry, researchers reported a mutation -- R451C in the gene Neurologin-3, known to cause autism in humans -- was found to provoke a higher level of communication among a network of transplanted human brain cells in mouse brains. This overexcitation, quantified in experiments by the scientists, manifests itself as a burst of electrical activity more than double the level seen in brain cells without the mutation.

""We were surprised to find an enhancement, not a deficit,"" said Zhiping Pang, an associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology in the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the senior author on the study. ""This gain-of-function in those specific cells, revealed by our study, causes an imbalance among the brain's neuronal network, disrupting the normal information flow.""

The interconnected mesh of cells that constitutes the human brain contains specialized ""excitatory"" cells that stimulate electrical activity, balanced by ""inhibitory"" brain cells that curtail electrical pulses, Pang said. The scientists found the oversized burst of electrical activity caused by the mutation threw the mouse brains out of kilter.

Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. About 1 in 44 children have been identified with the disorder, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Studies suggest autism could be a result of disruptions in normal brain growth very early in development, according to the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. These disruptions may be the result of mutations in genes that control brain development and regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, according to the NIH.

""So much of the underlying mechanisms in autism are unknown, which hinders the development of effective therapeutics,"" Pang said. ""Using human neurons generated from human stem cells as a model system, we wanted to understand how and why a specific mutation causes autism in humans.""

Researchers employed CRISPR technology to alter the human stem cells' genetic material to create a line of cells containing the mutation they wanted to study, and then derived human neuron cells carrying this mutation. CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, is a unique gene-editing technology.

In the study, the human neuron cells that were generated, half with the mutation, half without, were then implanted in the brains of mice. From there, researchers measured and compared the electrical activity of specific neurons employing electrophysiology, a branch of physiology that studies the electrical properties of biological cells. Voltage changes or electrical current can be quantified on a variety of scales, depending on the dimensions of the object of study.

""Our findings suggest that the NLGN3 R451C mutation dramatically impacts excitatory synaptic transmission in human neurons, thereby triggering changes in overall network properties that may be related to mental disorders,"" Pang said. ""We view this as very important information for the field.""

Pang said he expects many of the techniques developed to conduct this experiment to be used in future scientific investigations into the basis of other brain disorders, such as schizophrenia.

""This study highlights the potential of using human neurons as a model system to study mental disorders and develop novel therapeutics,"" he said.

Other Rutgers scientists involved in the study include Le Wang, a postdoctoral associate in Pang's lab, and Vincent Mirabella, who is earning doctoral and medical degrees as part of the MD-PhD student at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; Davide Comoletti, an assistant professor, Matteo Bernabucci, a postdoctoral fellow, Xiao Su, a doctoral student, and Ishnoor Singh, a graduate student, all of the Rutgers Child Health Institute of New Jersey; Ronald Hart, a professor, Peng Jiang and Kelvin Kwan, assistant professors, and Ranjie Xu and Azadeh Jadali, postdoctoral fellows, all of the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences.

Vitamin C as a cancer therapy has had a controversial past. What has been intriguing are small clinical trials that suggest some responses, but with no clear rationale for why cancers should respond to vitamin C or a path forward for explaining which patients are most likely to respond. Now a growing number of preclinical studies are showing how high-dose vitamin C might benefit cancer patients. ...
Since the mechanisms of action of vitamin C are becoming better defined, we can propose vitamin C combinations in a more rational, hypothesis-driven manner. In addition, given the current high financial cost of new cancer drugs, it seems rational to improve the effectiveness of current therapies by studying their clinical interactions with vitamin C. In our view, the implementation of this treatment paradigm could provide benefit to many cancer patients.

576,"NIH BRAIN Initiative tool may transform how scientists study brain structure and function

Researchers have developed a high-tech support system that can keep a large mammalian brain from rapidly decomposing in the hours after death, enabling study of certain molecular and cellular functions. With funding through the National Institutes of Health BRAIN Initiative, researchers developed a way to deliver an artificial blood supply to the isolated postmortem brain of a pig, preventing the degradation that would otherwise destroy many cellular and molecular functions and render it unsuitable for study. Importantly, although the researchers saw some preservation of flow through blood vessels and energy use, there was no higher level functional activity in the brain circuits. The scientific team, led by Nenad Sestan, M.D., Ph.D., of Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, reports on their findings in the journal Nature.

""This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the postmortem brain,"" explained Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, Ph.D., BRAIN Initiative Team Lead at the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health, which co-funded the research. ""The new technology opens up opportunities to examine complex cell and circuit connections and functions that are lost when specimens are preserved in other ways. It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow, such as during a heart attack.""

Researchers’ ability to study the functional dynamics of an intact, isolated large postmortem brain has been hampered by cell death, clotting of small blood vessels and other toxic processes that degrade the tissue following loss of blood flow and oxygen. Freezing and other preservation methods allow for only static microscopic, biochemical or structural analyses.

To overcome these limitations, Sestan and colleagues created a system called BrainEx (after ""ex vivo""), specially designed to attenuate some of the processes responsible for degradation of tissue in postmortem brains. The researchers used brains from a pork processing plant that would have otherwise been discarded. The system involves pumping a solution called BEx perfusate — a proprietary mixture of protective, stabilizing and contrast agents, that act as substitutes for blood — into the isolated brain’s main arteries at normal body temperature.

Brains processed with BEx showed reduced cell death, preserved anatomical and cell architecture, restored blood vessel structure and circulatory function, restored glial inflammatory responses, spontaneous neural activity at synapses and active cerebral metabolism, compared to brains perfused with a control solution, which rapidly decomposed. Importantly, there was no global electrical activity that would indicate higher-order functions, such as awareness or perception.

The results suggest that delivering protective agents to the brain through its dense network of blood vessels may hold potential for improving survival and reducing neurological deficits after trauma.

Among potential future applications, the researchers suggest BrainEx might be used to test how an experimental drug affects the intricate 3-D wiring of a large brain. The BEx system may also help researchers use postmortem brain specimens to study the effects of brain injury on cells and neural connections.

""BrainEx’s cell-protective formulations may someday find application in therapies for disorders such as stroke,"" said Sestan. ""The isolated large mammalian brain’s capacity for restoration of microcirculatory, molecular and cellular activity has been underappreciated.""

The BRAIN Initiative was founded on the principle that new tools and advanced technologies are needed to accelerate scientific discoveries that can lead to a better understanding of brain function and human diseases. While the researchers stress that BrainEx offers ample opportunities for scientific exploration in animal postmortem brains without restoration of brain circuit activity, they specify contingencies that would guard against crossing of ethical lines should any signs of such functions appear as the technology develops.

""As medical researchers, we have an ethical imperative to use the powerful tools developed by BRAIN Initiative researchers to help unravel the mysteries of brain injuries and diseases,"" said Christine Grady, R.N., Ph.D., chief of the Department of Bioethics at the NIH Clinical Center. ""It’s also our duty to work with researchers to thoughtfully and proactively navigate any potential ethical issues they may encounter as they open new frontiers in brain science. Since the launch of the BRAIN Initiative in 2013, NIH has been working with experts to address these questions.""

The BRAIN Initiative is funding a growing network of neuroethics researchers. NIH has also been working with experts, including the Neuroethics Working Group of the BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group, which reports to the FACA-chartered Advisory Councils of the 10 NIH institutes and centers that contribute to the NIH BRAIN Initiative. These efforts have guided the integration of neuroethics across projects as our understanding and capabilities expand. NIH recently published an overview of its multi-faceted and proactive approach to navigate potential ethical implications of new technologies funded by the BRAIN Initiative. A keystone of the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s neuroethics strategy is a set of Neuroethics Guiding Principles. Further, the NIH organizes workshops to explore emerging areas of science that raise ethical questions, including one last year that focused on research with human neural tissue.

578,"Researchers at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) have discovered that a type of immune cell known as Langerhans appears to play an important role in photosensitivity, an immune system reaction to sunlight that can trigger severe skin rashes.

The study, a collaborative effort among scientists at HSS and other institutions nationwide, appeared online in the journal, Science Translational Medicine on August 15. Photosensitivity, in which even ambient exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can result in a blistering or scaly, thickened skin rash, affects 30 to 60 percent of people with lupus. It can also occur in individuals with other autoimmune diseases or dermatologic conditions. The skin lesions can be disfiguring, contributing to feelings of low self-worth and depression. In lupus patients, photosensitivity is also associated with systemic disease flare-ups.

""Photosensitivity is poorly understood, and we launched the study to gain insight into the underlying cause,"" explained Theresa Lu, MD, PhD, lead investigator and associate scientist in the Autoimmunity and Inflammation Program at HSS. ""Current treatment consists mainly of sun avoidance and sunscreen to prevent the skin rash. A better understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in photosensitivity could lead to improved treatment.""

Dr. Lu and colleagues zeroed in on Langerhans cells (LCs), immune cells that sit in the epidermis, the top layer of the skin, hypothesizing that these cells might have a protective function. Cells in the top layer of the skin known as keratinocytes depend on epidermal growth factor family (EGF) cytokines to remain healthy. When LCs are functioning well, they express a molecule called ADAM17 that is activated when exposed to UV light. ADAM17 is responsible for activating cytokines in the EGF family.

""Our laboratory study found that Langerhans cells played an important role in protecting the skin from UV light-induced injury. In models of lupus, LCs express less of the ADAM17 molecule, so they are less effective at activating the EGF family cytokines that play a role in protecting the skin. In other words, the cellular pathway is not working as it should,"" Dr. Lu explained.

Dr. Lu notes that the study uncovered an important new function for Langerhans cells. ""We knew that they were immune cells that protect against infection, so this is a new role for them in terms of protecting the health of the skin exposed to UV light,"" she explained. ""We're excited about these findings because they provide new insight into photosensitivity, and we now have a potential pathway of molecules and cells to target for a possible treatment down the road.""

She said her laboratory will continue to conduct research to further elucidate the biological underpinnings of photosensitivity and determine why lupus patients are susceptible to the condition.",0

580,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― Heart patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or stent placement― nonsurgical procedures to improve blood flow to the heart ― are typically prescribed anti-platelet therapy to avoid blood clots that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. New research from the international TAILOR-PCI trial, the largest pharmacogenetics clinical trial in cardiology, suggests that genetic testing could potentially be a useful tool to help select antiplatelet medication. Pharmacogenetics is the use of a patient's genetic makeup in prescribing treatments that are likely to be most successful.

The trial, led by Naveen Pereira, M.D., and Michael Farkouh, M.D., is published in JAMA. Dr. Pereira is a cardiovascular disease specialist at Mayo Clinic and Dr. Farkouh is a cardiologist from the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network. The trial originated from a Mayo Clinic study catalyzed by Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine and Department of Cardiovascular Diseases in 2012.

Clopidogrel is the most commonly used antiplatelet drug, but about 30% of Americans carry variants in the CYP2C19 gene, which interfere with the metabolism of clopidogrel. These patients are in a high-risk category due to their genetic makeup, but they can be identified with a simple point-of-care genetic test. Patients who have the CYP2C19 gene variants may be good candidates for alternative anti-platelet therapy.

The trial focused on people with the loss of function CYP2C19 gene variants who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention to see if genotype-guided therapy in that group would be more beneficial than giving clopidogrel to all. Mayo Clinic was the clinical coordinating center and data coordinating center for the five-year clinical trial, which spanned 40 centers in Canada, Mexico, South Korea and the U.S. The data coordinating center was led by Kent Bailey, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic statistician, and the chair of the steering committee was Charanjit Rihal, M.D., a Mayo Clinic interventional cardiologist.

The trial enrolled 5,302 patients who had been treated for artery blockage with one or more stents, and followed them for one year. Half of the group was randomized to be tested for the CYP2C19 gene variation and the carriers (35%) were treated with the alternative anti-platelet medication, ticagrelor. The remainder of the group was given clopidogrel, as was the entire other randomized half that consisted of the control group of patients who did not receive genetic testing.

The results showed a statistically not significant 34% reduction in blood clotting events in the loss of function CYP2C19 gene carrier patients assigned to ticagrelor in the genotype-guided group. The loss of function CYP2C19 gene carrier patients that received clopidogrel showed a 5.9% event rate versus a 4.4% event rate in those who received genotype-guided ticagrelor treatment. The study narrowly missed its statistical goal, which was a 50% reduction in blood clotting events.

""Although these results fell short of the effect size that we predicted, they nevertheless provide a signal that offers support for the benefit of genetic testing, with approximately one-third fewer adverse events in the patients who received genetically guided treatment, compared with those who did not,"" says Dr. Pereira.

Dr. Pereira explains that the standard of care following coronary angioplasty and stent placement has evolved and greatly improved since the study was designed in 2012. The advent of drug-coated stents and other medical treatments improved care by reducing the expected rate of adverse events for patients in a year, but at the same time made it more difficult for the trial to reach its goal. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has funded an extended follow-up study of TAILOR-PCI to determine if genetic-guided treatment will benefit longer-term outcomes.

The trial was positioned for patient evaluation at one year and just missed statistical significance. However, data at the three-month mark hold important implications for pharmacogenetics. In the first three months after the procedure, TAILOR-PCI showed an 80% risk reduction in patients with the CYP2C19 gene variation who were given ticagrelor. Furthermore, when evaluating the total number of events experienced per patient, genetic-guided treatment showed a statistically significant 40% reduction in events, compared to those who received standard treatment.

""Clopidogrel offers many advantages, but for those who can't metabolize the drug, this trial demonstrates the potential effectiveness of a personalized medicine approach,"" says Dr. Farkouh. ""For patients who do not have a loss of function variation, it may be cost-effective to use clopidogrel, as it's widely available and has a favorable safety profile. We plan to report a cost-effective analysis in a separate manuscript.""

""TAILOR PCI represents an important public-private partnership in advancing science and therapeutics for the benefit of patients. We will continue to seek more follow-up data and ascertain clinical endpoints,"" says Dr. Rihal.

""The TAILOR-PCI trial is an example of the rigorous testing needed to explore personalized, genetic-guided treatment and whether it can improve patients’ outcomes,"" says Yves Rosenberg, M.D. ""The results suggest potential value of a personalized, pharmacogenomic approach to the management of patients with heart disease undergoing coronary stenting."" Dr. Rosenberg leads the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Atherothrombosis and Coronary Artery Disease Branch and is a co-author on the study.

The study was funded by Mayo Clinic, Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Spartan Bioscience Inc. supplied the point-of-care genetic tests used.

To get around the low number of deaths we can compare all vaccinated to unvaccinated. In which case, for 15-19 year olds, the unvaccinated crude mortality rate is 0.15 per 1000 and the vaccinated is 0.16 per 1000, so not really very different.
The difference is larger for the 10-14 year olds (0.06 per 1000 unvaccinated, 0.09 per 1000 vaccinated) as they were vaccinated later so there is still a larger difference in the proportion who are clinically vulnerable in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. We'd expect this to reduce over time as more 10-14 year olds are vaccinated and have contributed more person years to the vaccinated states.

582,"The Zika virus can remain in mouse brain for extended periods, leading to long-term neurological and behavioral consequences, according to a study published December 10 in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens by Daniela Verthelyi of the US Food and Drug Administration, and colleagues.

Infections in the perinatal period are associated with lasting cognitive impairment and increased risk for psychological disorders. The congenital brain malformations associated with Zika virus infections early in pregnancy are well documented. But the potential defects and long-term consequences associated with milder infections in late pregnancy and the perinatal period are less well understood. To address this knowledge gap, Verthelyi and colleagues exposed one-day-old mice to the Zika virus and monitored the neurological and behavioral consequences up to one year later.

The animals developed a transient neurological syndrome characterized by unsteady gait, tremors, and seizures 10 to 15 days after infection, but these symptoms subsided after one week, and most animals survived. Despite apparent recovery, Zika virus and inflammation were detected in the central nervous system of mice one year later. These older mice showed reduced volume of a brain region called the cerebellum, resulting in significant long-term deficits in motor function and coordination. In addition, the older mice showed anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsive or risky behavior. Based on these findings, the authors recommend long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring of patients exposed to the virus at an early age, as well as anti-viral treatment to clear persistent reservoirs from the brain.

The authors conclude, ""There is mounting evidence that emerging viruses like Zika and Chikungunya can establish reservoirs in immune privileged sites and play a role in development of chronic diseases.""",0

In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritised in individuals who are more susceptible or more at risk of severe disease. Individuals in risk groups may also be more at risk of hospitalisation or death due to non-COVID-19 causes, and thus may be hospitalised or die with COVID-19 rather than from COVID-19.

588,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0

591,"Women in early pregnancy who have high levels of a certain thyroid hormone may be at greater risk for gestational diabetes, compared to women who have normal levels of the hormone, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health. Their study appears in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

The researchers found that pregnant women with the highest levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), were more than four times more likely to develop gestational diabetes, compared to women with lower levels of the hormone. T3 is produced from the related hormone thyroxine (T4). The researchers also found that a high T3/T4 ratio — which indicates a high conversion rate from T4 to T3 — was strongly associated with a higher risk for gestational diabetes.

To conduct the study, researchers evaluated medical records of 107 women with gestational diabetes, comparing them to 214 pregnant women who had not developed the condition. The women had taken part in the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a diverse sample of more than 2,300 participants. The authors note that abnormal thyroid functioning has been linked to miscarriage and preterm birth. Their findings suggest that screening pregnant women for thyroid disease early in pregnancy could help identify women at high risk for gestational diabetes and other pregnancy-related complications.

593,"Nov. 14, 2022 – A new study sheds light on the escalating youth suicide crisis, revealing that emergency room visits for suicidal thoughts among kids and teens steeply increased even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency room visits for “suicidal ideation” (or suicidal thoughts) among 5- to 19-year-olds increased 59% from 2016 to 2021, and hospitalizations rose 57% from fall 2019 to the fall of 2020, according to the study published today by the American Academy of Pediatrics. “A lot of people have talked about mental health problems in youth during the pandemic, but it was happening before the pandemic,” said author Audrey Brewer, MD, MPH, in a news release from the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. “This has been an issue for so long, and it's getting worse.” Researchers looked at data for 81,105 emergency room visits across 205 Illinois hospitals from 2016 to 2021 for kids between the ages of 5 to 19.

The researchers found “there was a very sharp spike in fall 2019, followed by a similar spike during the pandemic fall of 2020, with highest number of monthly visits during October 2020,” the authors said. “Youth aged 14 to 17 years had the highest frequency of [suicidal ideation emergency room] monthly visits, with visits in this group greater than the other age groups combined.” Last year, the CDC announced that suicide is the second leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds. The new research is being called a benchmark because it evaluates emergency room data for suicidal thoughts – a critical point-of-care for serving youths' mental health needs. The data showed that providers were increasingly likely to list suicidal thoughts as the main diagnosis. “Suicidal ideation can be thought about as two types: actively thinking about suicide or having thoughts, but not having a plan,” Brewer said in the news release. “That could be the difference in why someone might get admitted to the hospital.” The researchers hypothesize that care between 2019 (when the initial spike occurred) was delayed in the early days of the pandemic, and that delay possibly contributed to the increase in providers identifying suicidal ideation as the main diagnosis.",0
594,"Oregon State University scientists have taken a key step toward better understanding neurodegenerative diseases by using a suite of biophysical techniques to learn more about a motor protein whose malfunction is associated with many disorders.

The study, published in the journal eLife, represents important progress toward improved care for the millions of people around the world affected by conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

Neurodegenerative diseases occur when nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, known as neurons, break down, function abnormally and eventually die. As neurons deteriorate, patients typically experience a range of gradually worsening neurological symptoms that can progress to debilitation and, in many cases, death.

According to the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center, 5 million people in the United States have Alzheimer's disease and 1 million have Parkinson's. There are also 400,000 MS patients and 30,000 have ALS, a disease that reached the public's consciousness when baseball star Lou Gehrig was diagnosed with it in 1939.

Neurodegenerative conditions onset primarily in mid- to late-life, meaning the incidence is expected to rise as the U.S. population ages. Demographic data suggest that without new interventions more than 12 million Americans will be affected by neurodegenerative diseases by 2050.

Elisar Barbar, head of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the OSU College of Science, and Kayla Jara, program coordinator for Oregon State's genetic code expansion center, GCE4All, led a deep dive into dynein, one of the two types of motor proteins within cells; the other type is kinesin.

Motor proteins are tiny molecular machines that animal and fungi cells use to convert chemical energy into mechanical work. They are miniature ""vehicles"" traversing a cell via a network of tracks referred to as the cytoskeleton, hauling a cellular payload and generating forces to aid in many vital processes and functions.

""Dynein is responsible for the transport of cargo that controls cell proliferation and differentiation in the nervous system in the immediate aftermath of injury and during regeneration,"" Jara said. ""Neurodegenerative diseases arise as a consequence of mutations in the genes that produce components of the dynein motor and impair transport machinery in the axon.""

Nerve cells can be very long and heavily dependent on motor proteins to ensure transport of material between the cell body and the tip of the axon, she said. A cable that extends from the main part of the cell, the axon transmits electrical impulses from one neuron to other neurons.

""Just as freeways connect towns and cities, inside our cells lie an array of roads called microtubules that the motor proteins use to shuttle their loads,"" Barbar said. ""Dynein is responsible for carrying cargo in one direction, and about 40 proteins of the kinesin type haul in the opposite direction. That suggests there are intricate methods of regulation between the many subunit proteins that together make up dynein.""

In this study, Barbar and Jara, a doctoral student during the research, collaborated with scientists from Oregon State and Lewis & Clark College for a close look at one of those subunits: the intermediate chain, or IC, which acts as a binder for other subunits as well as for two non-dynein proteins, p150Glued and NudE.

""These binding interactions all take place in the first half of IC, which has escaped study by many structural techniques because it doesn't fold into a specific structure,"" Barbar said. ""We wanted to find out how the binding of the subunits regulates IC interactions with p150Glued and NudE. This question has gone unanswered because of the difficulty in studying unstructured protein complexes of this size. But p150Glued and NudE bind to the same region of IC, and those proteins are involved in different dynein functions, so there must be a mechanism to select between the two.""

Studying proteins from a fungus, Chaetomium thermophilum, the scientists learned what that mechanism is: IC's ability to fold back on itself and affect the p150Glued/NudE binding site. Due to the challenge of conducting research into non-structured proteins, many biophysical techniques were used in combination, Jara said, which resulted in a blueprint for how to study other, similar protein complexes.

""Dynein is the molecular motor responsible for transport of misfolded proteins so they can be broken down, meaning it is crucially involved in the appearance and clearance of proteins that are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases,"" Jara added. ""In particular, dynein malfunction is an early feature in disorders such as ALS and Alzheimer's. Knowledge about the dynein structure and how it works will contribute to our understanding and treatment of these disorders.""

Other Oregon State researchers involved with the study were Patrick Reardon and Zhen Yu, as well as undergraduate students Prajna Woonnimani, Coban Brooks and Cat Vesely. Nikolaus Loening, a chemistry professor at Lewis & Clark College, also took part.

595,"Want to learn a new skill? Take some short breaks

NIH study suggests our brains may use short rest periods to strengthen memories.

In a study of healthy volunteers, National Institutes of Health researchers found that our brains may solidify the memories of new skills we just practiced a few seconds earlier by taking a short rest. The results highlight the critically important role rest may play in learning.

“Everyone thinks you need to ‘practice, practice, practice’ when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, may be just as critical to learning as practice,” said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a senior author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology. “Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to ‘relearn’ lost skills.”

The study was led by Marlene Bönstrup, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen’s lab. Like many scientists, she held the general belief that our brains needed long periods of rest, such as a good night’s sleep, to strengthen the memories formed while practicing a newly learned skill. But after looking at brain waves recorded from healthy volunteers in learning and memory experiments at the NIH Clinical Center, she started to question the idea.

The waves were recorded from right-handed volunteers with a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography. The subjects sat in a chair facing a computer screen and under a long cone-shaped brain scanning cap. The experiment began when they were shown a series of numbers on a screen and asked to type the numbers as many times as possible with their left hands for 10 seconds; take a 10 second break; and then repeat this trial cycle of alternating practice and rest 35 more times. This strategy is typically used to reduce any complications that could arise from fatigue or other factors.

As expected, the volunteers’ speed at which they correctly typed the numbers improved dramatically during the first few trials and then leveled off around the 11th cycle. When Dr. Bönstrup looked at the volunteers’ brain waves she observed something interesting.

“I noticed that participants’ brain waves seemed to change much more during the rest periods than during the typing sessions,” said Dr. Bönstrup. “This gave me the idea to look much more closely for when learning was actually happening. Was it during practice or rest?”

By reanalyzing the data, she and her colleagues made two key findings. First, they found that the volunteers’ performance improved primarily during the short rests, and not during typing. The improvements made during the rest periods added up to the overall gains the volunteers made that day. Moreover, these gains were much greater than the ones seen after the volunteers returned the next day to try again, suggesting that the early breaks played as critical a role in learning as the practicing itself.

Second, by looking at the brain waves, Dr. Bönstrup found activity patterns that suggested the volunteers’ brains were consolidating, or solidifying, memories during the rest periods. Specifically, they found that the changes in the size of brain waves, called beta rhythms, correlated with the improvements the volunteers made during the rests.

Further analysis suggested that the changes in beta oscillations primarily happened in the right hemispheres of the volunteers’ brains and along neural networks connecting the frontal and parietal lobes that are known to help control the planning of movements. These changes only happened during the breaks and were the only brain wave patterns that correlated with performance.

“Our results suggest that it may be important to optimize the timing and configuration of rest intervals when implementing rehabilitative treatments in stroke patients or when learning to play the piano in normal volunteers,” said Dr. Cohen. “Whether these results apply to other forms of learning and memory formation remains an open question.”

Dr. Cohen’s team plans to explore, in greater detail, the role of these early resting periods in learning and memory.

598,"June 9, 2022 -- The World Health Organization has warned of a strong likelihood that cases of monkeypox could escalate in Europe over the summer months, with transmission of the virus boosted by people gathering at festivals and other large-scale events. ""The potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere over the summer is high. Monkeypox has already spread against the backdrop of several mass gatherings in the region,” Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said last week. ""Over the coming months, many of the dozens of festivals and large parties planned provide further contexts where amplification may occur."" The U.K. has experienced the brunt in the current outbreak of monkeypox, with a total of 321 cases confirmed by the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) as of June 7, the largest number of confirmed cases among 29 nations which have reported at least one case. On Wednesday, the Agency announced that it was making monkeypox a notifiable disease in England. Globally, there have been more than 1,000 cases of the virus reported to the WHO in the current outbreak, not including cases in African countries where the virus is endemic. ""The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic countries is real,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, warned during a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday. That said, Kluge in his May 31 statement said that based on the situation so far, ""this outbreak is currently being transmitted through social networks connected largely through sexual activity, primarily involving men who have sex with men.” Many of the infections appeared to involve ""fleeting and/or multiple sexual partners, sometimes associated with large events or parties,” he said, though stressed that the monkeypox virus can affect anyone. But the gay and bisexual communities should be applauded for their high awareness of health and willingness to contact healthcare services if they were symptomatic, Kluge noted. And despite the WHO clearly identifying festival season as a significant monkeypox infection risk, he said it should also be seen as an opportunity ""to engage with young, sexually active, and globally mobile persons, to raise awareness.""

That is a stance that the UKHSA says it is taking to help contain the infection spreading here as the summer season begins. The Agency told Medscape UK that it was working closely with a wide range of organizations, nationally and regionally, to boost awareness. At first, its campaign began in London on May 28. There was firm evidence to do so, as epidemiological data up to May 30 showed that 86% of all monkeypox cases in England were in the capital. By that date, most cases had occurred in people aged 20 to 49 years old, and 111 cases out of the 183 identified in England to that date identified themselves as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. To target those most at risk, the UKHSA partnered with organizations including the LGBT+ website Stonewall, and sexual health provider, the Terence Higgins Trust, to target audiences with public health messaging about the disease. That was followed by a national rollout, scheduled to last 4 weeks, that has seen in-app advertising posted on the gay and bisexual dating platform, Grindr, alerting its users to the risk of contracting the monkeypox virus and directing them to reliable health information resources. ""LGBT+ organisations and sexual health charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust, Stonewall, and Grindr, have been superb at raising awareness of the symptoms and guiding people about what to do if they see a new rash or are concerned, and we'd like to thank them for all their efforts so far,” Andrew Lee, the UKHSA's national incident director for monkeypox, said. Other campaigns have included working with Do It London to organize a 3-week radio ad on Gaydio, and an offer of support to Pride in the capital for sharing public health messaging. The Agency says it is working with health protection bodies to coordinate activity with London's sexual health stakeholders, including developing a toolkit for event venues containing advice on cleaning protocols and vaccination for close contacts of monkeypox cases.",0

603,"The brain performs various cognitive and behavioral functions in everyday life, flexibly transitioning to various states to carry out these functions. Scientists view the brain as a system that performs these numerous functions by controlling its states. To better understand the properties of this control in the brain, scientists look for ways to estimate the difficulty of control, or control cost, when the brain transitions from one state to another. So a team of researchers undertook a study to quantify such control costs in the brain, and was successful in building a framework that evaluates these costs.

Controlling transitions to some states incurs greater ""costs"" than controlling transitions to others. With the development of a framework for quantifying transition costs, scientists will have a way to evaluate the difficulty of the shifts between various brain states. Possibly, they might also have a quantifiable measure for explaining cognitive loads, sleep-wake differences, habituation of cognitive tasks and psychiatric disorders.

The work is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

The team worked to build a novel framework to quantify control cost that takes account of stochasticity, or the randomness, of neural activity. This stochasticity has been ignored in previous studies. The current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework that is unable to consider stochasticity. But it is well known that the neural dynamics are stochastic and the noise is ubiquitous throughout the whole brain. ""In this work, we addressed the issue of stochasticity and first proposed a novel theoretical framework that quantifies the control cost taking account of the stochastic fluctuations of the neural dynamics,"" said Shunsuke Kamiya, a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo.

In their study, the researchers established the analytical expression of the stochastic control cost, which enabled them to compute the cost in high-dimensional neural data. By the analytical expression, they discovered that the optimal control cost can be decomposed into the costs to control the mean and covariance. ""This decomposition enables us to investigate how various brain areas differently contribute to controlling the transitions from one brain state to another,"" said Kamiya.

The researchers also identified the significant brain regions for the optimal control in cognitive tasks in human whole-brain imaging data. They examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states, using human whole-brain imaging data of 352 healthy adults. They found that, with these different transitions, the lower visual areas commonly played a significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex commonly played a significant role in controlling the covariances. The posterior cingulate cortex is the upper part of the limbic lobe, that region of the brain that plays an important role in memory and emotional behaviors.

In this study, the team only considered the optimal control cost where brain state transitions are controlled in an optimal manner, with minimization of stochastic control cost. However, in real neural systems, it is not likely that state transitions are controlled in an optimal manner. ""An intriguing future direction will be to compare the optimally controlled dynamics and the actual dynamics using neural data during tasks,"" said Masafumi Oizumi, associate professor in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo.

Looking ahead to future research, Oizumi explains that the ultimate goal of his lab is to understand the connection between brain dynamics and human behaviors, cognitions and consciousness. ""For example, we suspect that the decrease of controllability in the brain dynamics may be related to mental fatigue or the loss of consciousness. We expect that control theoretical perspective will provide a new insight to this goal,"" said Oizumi.",0

The effectiveness of inhibiting BRD4 in regulating prostate cancer cell migration and invasion is inconsistent, and inhibition of BRD2 or BRD3 may be more effective. CRPC is a highly aggressive form of prostate cancer that leads to lethal metastases, and current therapeutic options for CRPC are limited. According to Jordan Shafran, a PhD candidate in the department of molecular and translational medicine at BUSM, identifying ""druggable"" targets that regulate prostate cancer cell migration and invasion is crucial, given the complex and heterogeneous nature of CRPC and the varying AR states and expression patterns of individual tumor cells as the disease progresses.",1

608,"A type of white blood cell previously known only as a helper in the immune system appears also to be the instigator of the body's defenses against cancerous tumors. The discovery could lead to more effective cancer immunotherapy, a promising treatment which uses the body's own immune system, rather than radiation, to attack cancer cells.

In an animal study, Washington State University researchers found that a population of T cells called CD4-positive helper T cells helped start a chain of antitumor immunity defenses that allow killer cells to better infiltrate melanoma and breast cancer tumors. T cells belong to a class of white blood cells known as lymphocytes which move throughout the body's lymphatic system.

Many previous studies, and current immunotherapies, have focused primarily on the role of one-type of killer cells, called CD8-positive T cells. Yet, less than 20% of patients respond to those therapies and the initiating role of the CD4-positive helper cells could make those therapies better, said Hui Zhang, lead author on the study published in the Journal of Immunology.

""One of the most challenging parts of current cancer immunotherapy is the low response rate,"" said Zhang, a WSU assistant professor of pharmaceutical sciences. ""The lack of knowledge of how to enhance lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor hampers the success of improving the response rate to cancer immunotherapy. Our finding shows promise in solving this problem.""

Cancer is the second leading cause of death both nationally and worldwide. Currently, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are the conventional approaches to cancer treatment. However, those approaches cannot cure many cancers because some become metastatic, spreading from the primary tumor throughout the body, and certain cancer stem cells can become resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.

A relatively new treatment, immunotherapy has shown promise in curing a range of cancers, but only a relatively low number of patients respond to it. Zhang's research team hopes to change that with the knowledge of the mechanisms that help start the body's immune defenses.

The immune system has two types of killer cells: the CD8-positive T cells, and so-called ""natural killer"" cells. Both can attack virally infected cells and cancer cells.

Natural killer cells are innate and roam around the body. They act as the first line of defense in our immune system but cannot recognize specific antigens -- toxins or other foreign substances in the body -- on their own. After the natural killer cells start to work, the CD8-positive T cells, which can recognize specific antigens, arrive. While CD8-positive T cells and their mechanisms have been well studied and are used in current immunotherapies, not much is known about how to activate natural killer cells' antitumor function.

Using genetic knock-out mice experiments, Zhang's group found evidence that a certain type of CD4-positive T cells, called tissue-resident memory T cells, may be critical in activating those first lines of natural killer cell defenders. Their experiments showed that they were effective against both melanoma and breast cancer tumors.

""We found that this specific population of CD4 T cells were the key player to initiate the antitumor immunity,"" said Zhang.

The specific CD4 T-cells together with the natural killer cells not only killed tumor cells and controlled tumor progression but also enhanced infiltration of other white blood cells, or lymphocytes, into the tumor.

In future studies, the researchers plan to continue to investigate the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms of this antitumor immunity -- first in mice to develop an effective cancer immunotherapy. Then, the team hopes to move on to clinical trials in human subjects.

""Our goal is to develop a powerful cancer immunotherapy approach that is effective for all patients with different types of cancer,"" said Zhang.

611,"Metabolic pathways consist of a series of biochemical reactions in cells that convert a starting component into other products. There is growing evidence that metabolic pathways coupled with external stress factors influence the health of cells and tissues. Many human diseases, including retinal or neurodegenerative diseases, are associated with imbalances in metabolic pathways.

Elisabeth Knust leads a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany, who describe an essential role for one such metabolic pathway in maintaining retinal health under conditions of stress. They studied the classic Drosophila genes cinnabar, cardinal, white, and scarlet, originally characterized decades ago and named due to their role in eye color pigmentation, in particular the formation of the brown pigment of the fly eye. These genes encode components of the kynurenine pathway, whose activity converts the amino acid tryptophan by various steps into other products. In this study, the authors have highlighted the function of this metabolic pathway in retinal health, independent of its role in pigment formation.

The Kynurenine pathway is an evolutionary conserved metabolic pathway that regulates a variety of biological processes. Its disruption can result in the buildup of either toxic or protective biomolecules or metabolites, which can worsen or improve, respectively, the health of the brain, including the retina. Knowledge on this important metabolic pathway was recently extended by the research team, led by Elisabeth Knust, Director Emerita at the MPI-CBG, in their publication in the journal Plos Genetics. Being aware of the remarkable conservation of this metabolic pathway and the genes that regulate it, they used flies as a model system to unravel the role of individual metabolites in retinal health. The researchers looked at four genes -- cinnabar, cardinal, white, and scarlet - named after abnormal eye colors following their loss in flies. ""Since the Kynurenine pathway is conserved from flies to humans, we asked whether these genes regulate retinal health independent of their role in pigment formation,"" says Sarita Hebbar, one of the lead authors of the study.

To find this out, the scientists used a combination of genetics, dietary changes, and biochemical analysis of metabolites to study different mutations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Sofia Traikov, a co-author, developed a method for the biochemical analysis of the metabolites of the Kynurenine pathway. This allowed the researchers to link different metabolite levels to the health state of the retina. They found that one metabolite, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-K), is damaging to the retina. More importantly, they could show that the degree of degeneration is influenced by the balance between toxic 3OH-K and protective metabolites, such as Kynurenic Acid (KYNA), and not just by their absolute amounts. Sarita continues: ""We also fed two of these metabolites to normal (non-mutant) flies and found that 3OH-K enhanced stress-induced retinal damage, whereas KYNA protected the retina from stress-related damage."" This means that retinal health in certain conditions can be improved by altering the ratio of metabolites of the Kynurenine pathway.

Furthermore, by targeting these four genes and therefore four distinct steps within the pathway, the researchers were able to demonstrate that not only the accumulation of 3OH-K as such, but also its location in the cell and hence its availability in further reactions, is important for retinal health.

""This work shows that the Kynurenine pathway is important not only in pigment formation but that the level of individual metabolites fulfills important roles in maintaining retinal health,"" says Elisabeth Knust, who supervised the study. She concludes, ""In the future, the ratio of the various metabolites and the specific sites of their accumulation and activity should be taken into account in therapeutic strategies for diseases with impaired Kynurenine pathway function, observed in various neurodegenerative conditions.""",0

613,"New epigenetic biomarkers to predict more aggressive forms of prostate cancer have been discovered by scientists at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.

The biomarkers can be used in combination with traditional clinical tools to predict if a man will go on to develop a more metastatic and lethal form of the disease and could help clinicians to develop a better treatment plan.

""There's a need for men with prostate cancer to have more personalised treatments guided by the nature of their tumours, and they can't get that without new biomarkers that can better predict the risk of developing the lethal form the disease,"" says Professor Susan Clark, Head of the Epigenetic Research lab at Garvan and lead researcher of the study.

Prostate cancer is, globally, the second most common cancer diagnosed in men. After diagnosis, about 50 percent of men will develop metastatic cancer during their lifetime. Typically, metastasis takes 15 or more years to develop, but a small percentage of men develop a fatal, metastatic form much earlier after diagnosis.

By identifying patients who might go on to develop this form of prostate cancer at the early stages, clinicians could begin more aggressive treatments earlier.

The new study is published in the journal, Clinical and Translational Medicine.

This is one of the most long-term and comprehensive molecular studies of prostate cancer progression. The slow progression of the disease makes studying its biology difficult.

The bank of biopsies maintained for the last 20 years at Garvan and St Vincent's Hospital, allowed the researchers to analyse samples from 185 men who had their prostate removed due to a prostate cancer diagnosis in the 1990s and 2000s. The team then tracked the number of men who survived, and those who died from the disease, some more than 15 years later.

The researchers looked at their genomes and identified 1420 regions specific to the prostate cancer where they could see epigenetic changes -- marks on the DNA, known as DNA methylation. The methylation process can turn a gene's activity up or down without altering its DNA sequence like a mutation does.

Of those regions, 18 genes were further studied, with one standing out as a key biomarker, the CACNA2D4 gene, which is involved with calcium channel regulation.

""There's very little known about this gene and it's not typically profiled, so we really need to understand how the methylation process may suppress the gene's activity,"" says Dr Ruth Pidsley, first author of the study.

The team has made the comprehensive epigenome sequencing data available for other researchers to use for further prostate cancer research.

Not only did the results of the epigenome analysis show differences in men who had the lethal and non-lethal forms of prostate cancer, but the biomarkers also improved existing clinical tools for prognosis.

The new findings provide hope for a pathway to more personalised cancer treatment.

""What you really want to know on the day a patient is diagnosed, is who has the potential for lethal prostate cancer and who doesn't, because it will change the way you treat the cancer,"" says Professor Lisa Horvath an oncologist and researcher at Garvan, who was the clinical lead on the study.

""These epigenetic biomarkers have the potential to help us work out up front who has lethal prostate cancer and who doesn't,"" she says.

The next steps are to extend the study and to determine if the biomarkers can be detected in blood samples at the first instance.",0

There were about 9 million measles cases that year and 128,000 deaths, with 22 nations reporting large outbreaks. Because of interruptions in vaccinations, “measles is an imminent threat in every region of the world,” the report said.

Global action is needed to prevent more outbreaks, the report said, noting that measles is a highly contagious virus but is almost entirely preventable through vaccination.

“The paradox of the pandemic is that while vaccines against COVID-19 were developed in record time and deployed in the largest vaccination campaign in history, routine immunization programs were badly disrupted, and millions of kids missed out on life-saving vaccinations against deadly diseases like measles,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Getting immunization programs back on track is absolutely critical.

(1) In many places including Denmark, vaccinated individuals are tested more frequently than unvaccinated individuals. This causes the incidence rate to be higher in the vaccinated population and resultantly a negative VE estimate.
(2) Denmark was very quick to conduct sequencing and to identify the first generations of Omicron cases in the country. Cases during this period occurred to an exaggerated extent in those who were travelling internationally, and those in the social and professional circles of travellers, and were largely vaccinated. We expect therefore that there was an overrepresentation of vaccinated people among the first generations of Omicron cases identified in Denmark, not because the vaccines weren't protective, but because the variant hadn't spread far enough into the general population, including into the unvaccinated population, to make for comparable infection rates.
(3) VE estimation relies on vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals behaving in a similar fashion in their every-day lives with respect to COVID-19 precautions and exposure to infection risk. It is conceivable that the increasingly small cohort of unvaccinated individuals that remains in Denmark takes further precautions (precisely because they are not well protected), engage less in social activities, etc. Such discrepancies in risk behaviour between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals will lead to an underestimated VE.
On that basis it is reasonable to expect that the vaccine effectiveness estimates presented in our study are too low, not only for the fourth period (91-150 days after vaccination) but likely also for the earlier time intervals.
To conclude, the vaccines' protective effect may be low against infection with Omicron after 4 months, but it is most unlikely to be negative!

623,"A new study from an international team of researchers -- including two from Binghamton University -- demonstrates that social media could be used to detect behaviors preceding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the leading cause of death in people with uncontrolled epileptic seizures.

The findings, recently published in the journal Epilepsy & Behavior, reveal that the activity of epilepsy patients in social media increased before their sudden deaths. These changes in digital behavior could be used as early warning signals to put preventive interventions for SUDEP into practice.

SUDEP occurs when a person with epilepsy dies suddenly and no reason for death is found. Although the physiological mechanisms underlying SUDEP are still a mystery, people with frequent seizures are known to be at higher risk. The best preventive strategy currently is to keep seizures under control through medication, but reducing stress and keeping triggers in check are also key to decreasing the risk. However, measuring stress and other mood states can be difficult.

A study developed by researchers at Binghamton University, Indiana University and the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) in Portugal explored the potential of using social media to identify behavior signatures that might predict SUDEP.

""We instantly know when our best friend is not OK,"" said Rion Brattig Correia, co-first author of the study, a researcher at IGC and a visiting research scientist at Binghamton University. ""They are mumbling, talking too much or perhaps too little, eye contact is different, their tone is off -- we just know it. Sometimes we know it over the phone, only after a few words. What if by detecting this sudden behavioral change, we could save a friend's life?""

Building on these thoughts, the study examined the Facebook timelines of six epilepsy patients who died from SUDEP, using various tools to decipher human emotion and any stress markers hidden in their posts.

""The first thing we tried was simply to answer the question of whether the amount of written text was increased in the platform right before their death. And that's what we found,"" Correia said. ""For five subjects, the number of words written was significantly higher in their final days in comparison to the rest of their timeline.""

In addition, the type of words used by the subjects changed and there were drastic sentiment shifts in their posts in the weeks preceding their death.

""We found significant alterations in the patient's digital behavior that could be picked up as a signal by our algorithms,"" said Ian B. Wood from Indiana University and co-first author of the study.

These changes in the patient's social media engagement, as well as in the sentiment behind their publications, may serve as possible early-warning signals for SUDEP and guide preventive interventions.

""We thought that machine learning could be very useful to uncover patient behaviors and outcomes from the wide array of unconventional data out there, such as social media,"" said Luís M. Rocha, George J. Klir Professor of Systems Science at Binghamton and principal investigator at IGC.

Rocha led the cross-university group for the study, which was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The interdisciplinary work involved informatics/complex systems researchers, clinical/behavioral epilepsy scientists and support from the Epilepsy Foundation of America.

""In general, SUDEP studies do not consider digital behavioral data as we did here, but focus only on physiological and clinical data. As far as we know, this is the first time this kind of data was used in the study of SUDEP,"" said principal investigator Wendy Miller, an epilepsy specialist from the School of Nursing at IU who also contributed to the study.

She acknowledged that the inclusion of this digital data could offer a complementary view of patient behavior leading up to SUDEP that is often missed during clinical consultations: ""Any advances in this area are likely to have a significant impact on the lives of families affected.""

To validate the predictive power of these behavioral signals extracted from social media, the researchers intend to mount clinical studies involving more people to collect more data. If the digital behavior of patients proves to be useful at predicting SUDEP, the analysis could be expanded to platforms in addition to Facebook and possibly prevent unnecessary deaths.

""The method we employed could be applied to any digital behavior data, such as SMS or chat exchange, phone calls and other ways,"" Wood said.

Sponsored by the NIH's National Library of Medicine, the team is working on a personalized web service for epilepsy, myAura, which will include diverse clinical and non-clinical data, such as self-reported patient entries regarding seizures, medication adherence and physician encounters. The web service also will include the option for users to donate their social media timelines, making this data more easily accessible for larger studies.",0

634,"A woman's genetic make-up may cause her to gain weight when using a popular form of birth control, according to a study from researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

""For years, women have said that birth control causes them to gain weight but many doctors failed to take them seriously,"" said the study's lead author Aaron Lazorwitz, MD, assistant professor of Obstetrics/Gynecology and Family Planning at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""Now we have looked at the genetics and found that the way genes interact with some hormones in birth control could help explain why some women gain more weight than others.""

The study, published online today in the journal Contraception, specifically looked at the etonogestrel contraceptive implant. The rod-like implant, considered one of the most effective birth control methods, is inserted under the skin and contains etonogestrel a kind of progestin that inhibits ovulation.

The researchers reviewed medical records to calculate weight changes from the insertion of the implant to the time when the women enrolled in the study. Out of 276 ethnically diverse subjects, they found a median weight change of +3.2 kg or about 7 pounds of weight gained over an average of 27 months of use. The majority or 73.9% of subjects experienced weight gain.

Drawing on pharmacogenomics, the study of how genes affect a person's response to drugs, Lazorwitz and his colleagues investigated the genetics of the participants and how they might interact with the birth control drug within the implant.

They hypothesized that variants in the genes encoding proteins that break down and interact with progestin and estrogen hormones might be the key. Ultimately, they found that genetic variants in estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) among some study participants were associated with clinically significant weight gain.

ESR1 is found on chromosome six. It encodes an estrogen receptor involved in cellular hormone binding and DNA transcription when activated. Previous studies also found associations between ESR1 genetic variants and how well other medications work.

Women who had two copies of the ESR1 rs9340799 variant on average gained over 30 pounds more while using the contraceptive implant when compared to all other women in the study.

The study focused on the etonogestrel contraceptive implant, but it is possible that other birth control drugs could have similar interactions with genes that lead to weight gain.

""It is imperative to better understand how individual genetic variation may influence a woman's risk of adverse weight gain while using exogenous steroid hormone medications,"" Lazorwitz said.

For now, there is no way to predict who might be impacted.

Health care providers can offer counseling about potential weight gain or suggest other forms of birth control like copper IUDs which have no hormones.

""As our understanding of pharmacogenomics in women's health expands, we can develop individualized counseling that may reduce the incidence of hormone-related adverse effects, improve patient satisfaction, and help prevent future health risks associated with weight gain,"" Lazorwitz said.",0

640,"In a massive new analysis of findings from 277 clinical trials using 24 different interventions, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers say they have found that almost all vitamin, mineral and other nutrient supplements or diets cannot be linked to longer life or protection from heart disease.

Although they found that most of the supplements or diets were not associated with any harm, the analysis showed possible health benefits only from a low-salt diet, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and possibly folic acid supplements for some people. Researchers also found that supplements combining calcium and vitamin D may in fact be linked to a slightly increased stroke risk.

Results of the analysis were published on July 8 in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 52% of Americans take a least one vitamin or other dietary/nutritional supplement daily. As a nation, Americans spend $31 billion each year on such over-the-counter products. An increasing number of studies -- including this new one from Johns Hopkins -- have failed to prove health benefits from most of them.

""The panacea or magic bullet that people keep searching for in dietary supplements isn't there,"" says senior author of the study Erin D. Michos, M.D., M.H.S., associate director of preventive cardiology at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""People should focus on getting their nutrients from a heart-healthy diet, because the data increasingly show that the majority of healthy adults don't need to take supplements.""

For the current study, the researchers used data from 277 randomized clinical trials that evaluated 16 vitamins or other supplements and eight diets for their association with mortality or heart conditions including coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart attack. All together they included data gathered on 992,129 research participants worldwide.

The vitamin and other supplements reviewed included: antioxidants, ?-carotene, vitamin B-complex, multivitamins, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin B3/niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D alone, calcium alone, calcium and vitamin D together, folic acid, iron and omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil). The diets reviewed were a Mediterranean diet, a reduced saturated fat (less fats from meat and dairy) diet, modified dietary fat intake (less saturated fat or replacing calories with more unsaturated fats or carbohydrates), a reduced fat diet, a reduced salt diet in healthy people and those with high blood pressure, increased alpha linolenic acid (ALA) diet (nuts, seeds and vegetable oils), and increased omega-6 fatty acid diet (nuts, seeds and vegetable oils). Each intervention was also ranked by the strength of the evidence as high, moderate, low or very low risk impact.

The majority of the supplements including multivitamins, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D alone, calcium alone and iron showed no link to increased or decreased risk of death or heart health.

In the three studies of 3,518 people that looked at a low-salt diet in people with healthy blood pressure, there were 79 deaths. The researchers say that they found a 10% decrease in the risk of death in these people, which they classified as a moderate associated impact.

Of the five studies in which 3,680 participants with high blood pressure were put on a low-salt diet, they found that the risk of death due to heart disease decreased by 33%, as there were 674 heart disease deaths during the study periods. They also classified this intervention as moderate evidence of an impact.

Forty-one studies with 134,034 participants evaluated the possible impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplements. In this group, 10,707 people had events such as a heart attack or stroke indicating heart disease. Overall, these studies suggested that supplement use was linked to an 8 percent reduction in heart attack risk and a 7 percent reduction in coronary heart disease compared to those not on the supplements. The researchers ranked evidence for a beneficial link to this intervention as low.

Based on 25 studies in 25,580 healthy people, data also showed that folic acid was linked to a 20 percent reduced risk of stroke. Some 877 participants had strokes during the trials. The authors graded evidence for a link to beneficial effects as low.

The authors point out that the studies suggesting the greatest impact of folic acid supplementation on reducing stroke risk took place in China, where cereals and grains aren't fortified with folic acid like they are in the U.S. Thus, they say, this apparent protective effect may not be applicable in regions where most people get enough folic acid in their diet.

Twenty studies evaluated the combination of calcium with vitamin D in a supplement. Of the 42,072 research participants, 3,690 had strokes during the trials, and taken together the researchers say this suggests a 17% increased risk for stroke. The risk evidence was ranked as moderate. There was no evidence that calcium or vitamin D taken alone had any health risks or benefits.

642,"Researchers are now able to use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to form a model of human adult-like cardiac muscle by introducing electric and mechanical stimulation at an early stage. Since this muscle is similar to the adult heart, it could serve as a better model for testing the effects of drugs and toxic substances than current tissue-engineered heart models. The study, performed by scientists at Columbia University, New York City, and funded by the National Institutes of Health, was published today in Nature.

Stem cells have the potential to turn into many different types of cells. Human cells lose this flexibility once they have matured, which is why, for example, heart cells don’t spontaneously decide to become lung cells. iPSCs are cells taken from an adult that have been manipulated, or induced, into a stem-cell state. Researchers are then able to guide these “blank slate” cells into different cell types by using various chemical and physical stimuli. Scientists have been able to engineer cardiac tissue using iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) for years. However, engineering tissue that can successfully mimic the intricacies of adult human heart cells is not easy and, until now, had not been achieved in the lab.

“Human cardiac tissues grown in the lab that displays the behavior of native heart muscle would be transformative for biomedical research,” said Gordana Vunjak-Novaković, Ph.D., Biomedical Engineering Professor at Columbia University. “To reach this goal, we forced the cultured heart muscle to go through the fetal-to-postnatal transition by an accelerated development. This was done by using early-stage iPS-CMs and increasing the frequency of electrically induced contractions, little by little, every day. The tissues responded, and displayed adult-like gene expression, remarkably organized ultrastructure, and a number of functional features seen in the mature heart muscle, after only four weeks of culture.”

Vunjak-Novaković and her team have made significant strides in reliably engineering human heart muscle that mimics adult myocardium. They found that the longer they waited to introduce physical stimuli such as electric current and mechanical stimulation to the iPSCs, the less responsive the cells were. The team reasoned that the earlier they introduced electromechanical stimuli, the greater the effect would be.

They tested two types of iPS-CMs: early stage (12-day old cells) and late stage (28-day old mature cells) under three different scenarios. The first test condition was a control in which there was no stimulation whatsoever. The second was three weeks of constant electrical stimulation. The third was two weeks of progressively increasing levels of electrical stimulation followed by a week of constant intensity stimulation. This third scenario mimicked the changes the human heart undergoes during the last few weeks of fetal development and after birth.

The researchers found that the third scenario, introducing physical conditioning at an increasing intensity to early stage iPS-CMs, helped them form adult-like human cardiac tissue after just four weeks of culture in the lab.

“The resulting engineered tissue is truly unprecedented in its similarity to functioning human tissue,” said Seila Selimovic, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) Tissue Chips program. “The ability to develop mature cardiac tissue in such a short time is an important step in moving us closer to having reliable human tissue models for drug testing.” The better the engineered tissues emulate the human heart, the better they can predict the effects that drugs or environmental factors have on the actual heart tissue of a patient. Having a reliable human tissue model would help make drug development significantly faster, safer and cheaper.

643,"Sept. 12, 2022 -- The World Trade Center Health Program, set up to ensure medical care for 9/11 survivors and first responders, faces a $3 billion deficit, members of Congress say.

U.S. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Republican from New York, sent a letter to Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the Democratic chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, saying the program will not be able to accept any new sick responders or survivors after October 2024 without more funding.

645,"Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) have identified how certain gene mutations cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The pathway identified by the researchers may also be responsible for a certain form of dementia related to ALS. The finding could offer potential new approaches for treating this devastating condition, which causes progressive, fatal paralysis and sometimes mental deterioration similar to Alzheimer's disease. Their discovery was published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and included collaborators from Harvard University, University of Auckland, King's College London, and Northwestern University.

More than 5,000 Americans are diagnosed with ALS every year, a condition that is usually fatal and has no cure. Patients with ALS slowly lose the ability to move their muscles, leading to problems with basic functions such as breathing and swallowing. About half of ALS patients also develop dementia. Genetic studies of families with a predisposition to develop ALS have shown that the condition can be associated with certain gene mutations. Some of these mutations involve the gene UBQLN2 which regulates the disposal of misfolded ""garbage"" from the body's cells. Until now, researchers did not fully understand how UBQLN2 mutations interfere with this pathway and cause ALS.

""We mapped out the process by which ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) gene mutations disrupt an important recycling pathway that cells use to get rid of their trash,"" said Mervyn Monteiro, PhD, Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology, who is affiliated with the UMSOM's Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology (BioMET) at UMSOM. ""Without this recycling, misfolded proteins build up in the nerve cell and become toxic, eventually destroying the cell. This destruction could lead to neurodegenerative disorders like ALS.""

To investigate how UBQLN2 mutations cause ALS, Dr. Monteiro's group used both human cells and UBQLN2-mutant mouse models for their investigations. The mouse models, which they described in a 2016 PNAS publication, mimic the progression of the disease in people who inherit these gene mutations.

Dr. Monteiro's group first removed the UBQLN2 gene from human cells and found it completely stalled the recycling pathway. They then reintroduced either the normal gene or one of five gene mutations into the cells. They found that reintroduction of normal UBQLN2 restored the recycling pathway while all five of the gene mutations failed to restart the pathway.

Using the mouse model, Dr. Monteiro and his colleagues outlined the reason for the pathway disruption in the presence of gene mutations. They found that the mice with the gene mutations had reduced levels of a certain protein called ATP6v1g1, which is an essential part of a pump that acidifies the cell's trash container in order to initiate the breakdown and recycling process.

""Our new findings are exciting because similar acidification defects have been found in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Down syndrome,"" Dr. Monteiro said. ""This suggests that restoration of the defect could have broad implications for not only treating ALS, but possibly other neurodegenerative diseases as well.""

The research study was supported by grants from the Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins, the ALS Association, and the National Institutes of Health (grant number: R01-NS100008).

""The BioMET research team led by Dr. Monteiro continues to make important advances in understanding the mechanisms that give rise to ALS,"" said Dean E.

They come from fats carried by our food or produced by our bodies. Depending on the cause, the accumulation of triglycerides in blood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and pancreatic illnesses, and other complications,"" explained Dr. Daniel Gaudet, first author of the study. ""Our conclusions are promising in terms of the prevention of the risk associated with the accumulation of fat in blood."" The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Although rare forms of genetic triglyceride accumulation exist, for which there are few effective treatments, hypertriglyceridemia is the one most often associated with frequent health issues, such as obesity or diabetes. Last December, the same research team demonstrated blocking the expression of the gene that encodes apoC-III led to major relief of triglyceridemia in patients suffering a rare and extreme form of hypertriglyceridemia, which in turn opened the door for the identification of unexpected mechanisms that govern blood fat.

648,"NIH-funded rodent study finds molecular link between adolescent alcohol use and adult anxiety

New preclinical research in rats has identified a link between adolescent alcohol exposure and specific molecular changes in the brain that contribute to increased anxiety in adulthood. A large body of evidence demonstrates a strong relationship between alcohol and anxiety problems in humans.

“These findings provide insight into the mechanisms through which alcohol-induced brain changes during adolescence increase vulnerability to alcohol and anxiety problems in adulthood,” said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The new report is the latest installment of work led by NIAAA grantee Subhash C. Pandey, Ph.D., professor and director of the NIAAA-funded Alcohol Research Center in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Senior Research Career Scientist at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. Dr. Pandey and his colleagues have previously reported that rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence show greater anxiety-like behavior as adults compared to non-alcohol exposed rats. They have also shown that those effects were linked to two genes – brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) -- that nerve cells need to form new connections with each other.

In the current study, the Pandey group focused on epigenetic changes that affect expression of the Arc protein in the amygdala, a brain region linked to anxiety and alcohol misuse. Epigenetic changes refer to DNA modifications that affect expression of a gene without altering the gene’s DNA sequence. Specifically, the researchers wanted to determine if expression of a relatively new class of genetic material known as enhancer RNA (eRNA) was influenced by adolescent alcohol exposure and if epigenetic mechanisms, in turn, influenced expression of the Arc eRNA and gene in the adult amygdala. They also wanted to know whether this epigenetic mechanism played a role in anxiety-like behavior in adult animals that were exposed to alcohol during adolescence. A report of their findings is online in the journal Biological Psychiatry.

“eRNAs are noncoding RNAs that do not encode into protein but regulate a target gene’s function, thus representing crucial molecular events in gene expression,” explained Dr. Pandey.

As in their previous studies, the researchers administered alcohol to adolescent rats using a binge drinking-like model and examined the animals for anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood, including how blocking the activity of eRNAs specific to the Arc gene affected those behaviors.

They found that compared to adult animals without adolescent alcohol-exposure, the adolescent alcohol-exposed rats displayed both decreased Arc eRNA expression and Arc gene expression in the amygdala, as well as heightened anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. However, a dose of alcohol reduced the anxiety-like behavior and was associated with a reversal in Arc eRNA and Arc gene expression – suggesting that Arc contributes to anxiety-like behavior.

“We identified underlying epigenetic processes regulating Arc eRNA expression in adulthood that are affected by adolescent alcohol exposure,” said Dr. Pandey. “Adolescent alcohol exposure produces persistent effects on eRNA related to Arc gene expression via epigenetic reprogramming and lower eRNA levels in the amygdala. These effects, in turn, increased the susceptibility to anxiety in adulthood.”

Lastly, Dr. Pandey and his colleagues showed that directly blocking Arc eRNA in the amygdala of control rats led to anxiety-like behaviors, demonstrating that Arc eRNA expression in the amygdala regulates anxiety-like behaviors.

“These findings provide a better understanding of how adolescent alcohol exposure can lead to life-long biomolecular changes that increase the risk for adult-onset psychiatric disorders,” said Dr. Pandey.

Further research is necessary to determine if these newly identified molecular targets might lead to the development of better therapies for pathologies related to adolescent alcohol exposure.

649,"NIH-funded study closes in on personalized drug testing for neurological disorders.

Aided by advanced stem cell technology and tissue chips, National Institutes of Health-funded researchers used stem cells originally derived from a person’s skin to recreate interactions between blood vessels and neurons that may occur early in the formation of the fetal human spinal cord. The results published in Stem Cell Reports suggest that the system can mimic critical parts of the human nervous system, raising the possibility that it may one day, be used to test personalized treatments of neurological disorders.

Led by Samuel Sances, Ph.D., and Clive N. Svendsen, Ph.D., Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute, Los Angeles, CA, the researchers first converted the stem cells into newborn spinal cord neurons or epithelial cells that line walls of brain blood vessels. In most experiments, each cell type was then injected into one of two chambers embedded side-by-side in thumb-sized, plastic tissue chips and allowed to grow. Six days after injections, the researchers found that the growing neurons exclusively filled their chambers while the growing blood vessel cells not only lined their chamber in a cobblestone pattern reminiscent of vessels in the body, but also snuck through the perforations in the chamber walls and contacted the neurons. This appeared to enhance maturation of both cell types, causing the neurons to fire more often and both cell types to be marked by some gene activity found in fetal spinal cord cells.

Tissue chips are relatively new tools for medical research and since 2012 the NIH has funded several tissue-chip projects. Unlike traditional petri dish systems, tissue chips help researchers grow cells in more life-like environments. Using microprocessor manufacturing techniques, the chambers can be built to recreate the three-dimensional shapes of critical organ parts and the tight spaces that mimic the way viscous, bodily fluids normally flow around the cells. Both factors can influence the normal growth of organs and results from this study supported this idea. The tissue chips allowed the researchers to grow neurons and blood vessels together, which was impossible to do in petri dishes. Moreover, neurons grown alone in tissue chips had firing patterns and gene activity that were more mature than cells grown in petri dishes. Although further genetic analysis suggested the tissue-chip cells were in an early stage of fetal spinal cord formation, the researchers concluded that, overall, this is a promising start for the development of chips that mimic a patient’s nervous system.

650,"NIH-funded researchers and Google show machine learning can be applied to biomedical research.

In the early days of neuroscience research, scientists painstakingly stained brain cells and drew by hand what they saw in a microscope. Fast forward to 2018 and machines may be able to learn how to do that work. According to a new study in Cell, it may be possible to teach machines how to pick out features in neurons and other cells that have not been stained or undergone other damaging treatments. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“This approach has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research,” said Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.

“Researchers are now generating extraordinary amounts of data. For neuroscientists, this means that training machines to help analyze this information can help speed up our understanding of how the cells of the brain are put together and in applications related to drug development.”

A dish, or culture, of neuronal cells appears uniform to the naked eye and the different, individual cells in it cannot be seen. Ever since the late nineteenth century when pioneering neuroscientists, Santiago Ramon y Cajal and Camillo Golgi, drew the earliest maps of the nervous system, scientists have been developing dyes and staining methods to help distinguish the structures in the brain, including different types of cells and their state of health. However, many of these methods involve harsh chemicals that fix, or freeze, cells in an unnatural state or damage living cells after multiple stains have been applied. The traditional techniques also limit the details scientists can observe.

A team led by Steven Finkbeiner, M.D., Ph.D., director and senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, and professor of neurology and physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, explored whether computers could be trained to identify structures in unstained cells.

“Every day our lab had been creating hundreds of images, much more than we could look at and analyze ourselves. One day, a couple of researchers from Google knocked on our door to see if they could help us,” said Dr. Finkbeiner, the senior author of the study.

The researchers used a method called Deep Learning, which relies on principles of machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence in which machines can learn from data and make decisions. Facial recognition software is an example of machine learning.

Using Deep Learning, Dr. Finkbeiner’s team trained a computer program to analyze brain cells by showing it stained and unstained images. Then, to test whether the program had learned anything, the researchers challenged it with new unlabeled images.

After the first round of training, the program identified where cells were located in the culture dish by learning to spot a cell’s nucleus, a round structure that contains genetic information and serves as the cell’s command center. During additional experiments, Dr. Finkbeiner’s group increased the complexity of the features the program was looking for and successfully trained it to distinguish dead cells from living cells, as well as to identify specific types of brain cells. In addition, the program learned to differentiate between axons and dendrites, which are two specific types of extensions on neurons. According to the results, the program was successful in predicting structures in unlabeled tissue.

“Deep Learning takes an algorithm, or a set of rules, and structures it in layers, identifying simple features from parts of the image, and then passes the information to other layers that recognize increasingly complex features, such as patterns and structures. This is reminiscent of how our brain processes visual information,” said Dr. Finkbeiner. “Deep Learning methods are able to uncover much more information than can be seen with the human eye.”

Dr. Finkbeiner and his team noted that the main drawback to using this technology is that the training datasets need to be very large, ideally around 15,000 images. In addition, there may be a risk to overtraining the programs, that they become so specialized they can only identify structures in a particular set of images or in images generated in a particular way, and not make predictions about more general images, which could limit the use of this technology.

Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues plan to apply these methods to disease-focused research.

“Now that we showed that this technology works, we can start using it in disease research. Deep Learning may spot something in cells that could help predict clinical outcomes and can help us screen potential treatments,” said Dr. Finkbeiner.

More research is needed to refine the technology and make it more widely available.

Vaccines are rigorously tested and monitored and are among the safest medical products we use. Millions of vaccinations are given to children and adults in the United States each year. Serious adverse reactions are rare. However, because of the high volume of use, coincidental adverse events including deaths, that are temporally associated with vaccination, do occur. When death occurs shortly following vaccination, loved ones and others might naturally question whether it was related to vaccination. A large body of evidence supports the safety of vaccines, and multiple studies and scientific reviews have found no association between vaccination and deaths except in rare cases. During the US multi-state measles outbreak of 2014-2015, unsubstantiated claims of deaths caused by measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine began circulating on the Internet, prompting responses by public health officials to address common misinterpretations and misuses of vaccine safety surveillance data, particularly around spontaneous reports submitted to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We summarize epidemiologic data on deaths following vaccination, including examples where reasonable scientific evidence exists to support that vaccination caused or contributed to deaths. Rare cases where a known or plausible theoretical risk of death following vaccination exists include anaphylaxis, vaccine-strain systemic infection after administration of live vaccines to severely immunocompromised persons, intussusception after rotavirus vaccine, Guillain-Barré syndrome after inactivated influenza vaccine, fall-related injuries associated with syncope after vaccination, yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease or associated neurologic disease, serious complications from smallpox vaccine including eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, postvaccinal encephalitis, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy, and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis from oral poliovirus vaccine. However, making general assumptions and drawing conclusions about vaccinations causing deaths based on spontaneous reports to VAERS - some of which might be anecdotal or second-hand - or from case reports in the media, is not a scientifically valid practice.""

671,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Researchers at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center have identified a gene marker that may lead to a more effective, precision treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The researcher’s findings are published in Nature Cancer.

“Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers,” says the paper’s senior author Zhenkun Lou, Ph.D. Dr. Lou says while Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are now an FDA-approved option for standard maintenance therapy for patients with metastatic PDAC who harbor pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations, only about 10 percent of patients with PDAC harbor pathogenic mutations of the homologous recombination (HR) genes. “This leaves most patients missing out on this encouraging treatment strategy,” says Dr. Lou.

In this study, Dr. Lou and his colleagues found that the protein METTL16 may be a new biomarker for PARPi treatment, and that PDAC with elevated expression of METTL16, may benefit from PARPi treatment.

“METTL16, belongs to a family of factors that regulate RNA methylation, whose function in DNA repair is unclear,” says Dr. Lou. “We found that METTL16 expression was correlated with accumulated DNA damage in a PDAC microarray.” He says elevated METTL16 may result in HR DNA repair defects, which may lead to accelerated aging, disease or increased risk of cancer. “Our research showed that METTL16 suppresses DNA repair via interaction with a key DNA repair nuclease called MRE11.”

Dr. Lou and his colleagues found that METTL16 unexpectedly bound with MRE11 not through direct protein to protein interaction but through RNA. “Because METTL16 is highly expressed in a subset of PDAC and inhibits HR, PDAC cells with high METTL16 expression showed increased sensitivity to PARPi in both cellular and mouse models, especially when combined with gemcitabine,” says Dr. Lou.

These findings may collectively reveal that in addition to PDAC with BRCA1/2 mutation, PDAC without BRCA1/2 mutation, but with elevated expression of METTL16, may also be a target for PARPi treatment. “In addition, the treatment strategy of gemcitabine combined with PARPi may be more beneficial,” says Dr. Lou. He believes immunochemistry-based METTL16 expression detection of tumors may eventually become a routine clinical practice for patients before starting treatment.”

Dr. Lou says that his team unexpectedly found that METTL16 functions in DNA repair independent of its role in RNA m6A modification. “Prior to our study, all documents regarding METTL16 showed its role in cellular activity depending on the RNA m6A methyltransferase activity. Second, we strikingly revealed an inhibitory role of RNA and RNA binding proteins in DNA repair.” Dr. Lou says the function of RNA on promoting DNA repair has been investigated in several studies. In this study his team showed that RNA mediates the formation of an inhibitory complex (METTL16-RNA-MRE11 complex) in DNA repair regulation, which suggests RNA could also be a negative regulator of DNA repair.

673,"With one in five people experiencing ongoing pain long after knee replacement surgery, new research, led by the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) and published in The Lancet Rheumatology today [27 January], has shown a way to help reduce people's continuing pain that could also save the NHS time and money too.

One hundred thousand knee replacement surgeries are carried out in the UK every year. Most of these operations take place to treat pain related to osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, each year, around 20,000 people who have knee replacement surgery to relieve their pain find that they have moderate to severe pain three months or longer after their operation, which impacts on their everyday lives.

The study found the STAR care pathway (Support and Treatment After joint Replacement) reduces pain severity, the amount pain interferes with people's lives and is cost-effective. The new treatment could potentially save the NHS up to £14 million per year through reduced inpatient admissions.

The study found patients who received the STAR care pathway had:
• Less pain severity and impact on daily life at both six and 12 months after treatment (nine and 15 months after surgery)
• Reduced length of hospital stay for any inpatient admissions three months after surgery

The aim of the five-year STAR programme was to find ways to improve the care and support that people with ongoing pain receive. The programme, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), designed and tested a new treatment in a randomised controlled trial in eight UK hospitals.

The programme looked at how likely patients are to get ongoing knee pain after their operation and discovered why patients don't seek help. The research team developed a new treatment -- a care pathway -- for patients and compared how patients did on the STAR care pathway when compared with a control group who had the usual care.
• Three months after surgery patients attended an hour-long clinic, ran by specially trained health care professionals
• Detailed pain questionnaires were filled out and X-rays were taken as well as a blood test for infection. If needed patients were referred for further ongoing treatment
• Patients received up to six 'phone calls over the next 12 months, making sure they had their referral, and to check how they were doing

Rachael Gooberman-Hill, lead researcher for the STAR programme, Professor of Health and Anthropology and Director of Bristol's Elizabeth Blackwell Institute, said: ""People have a knee replacement to relieve their pain and it's immensely disappointing if they find that they have long-term pain afterwards. Unfortunately, one in five people who have knee replacement have long-term pain afterwards -- that is around 20,000 people each year in the UK alone.

""As a research team we wanted to do something that would help. We found that our new STAR care pathway had a positive impact on people's pain. People who had long-term pain after their knee replacement and who were given STAR had less pain and the pain interfered less with their lives one year later. People told us that STAR helped them to feel supported, to find out more about their pain and STAR meant that they were able to get further treatment that was tailored to their pain. We are enormously pleased with our research findings because it should make a real difference to people who find that they have pain after their knee replacement.""

Brenig, a participant on the STAR trial, explained: ""As part of the STAR trial, you have tailored physiotherapy appointments. At my three-month review with a STAR physiotherapist, I was having a problem not being able to straighten my leg out. She gave me some simple exercises, which worked and straightened the leg out. Occasionally I have problems at the back of the knee, then I do the exercises and it goes back to normal. So that was a very positive side of what we actually did.

""I felt that being part of the STAR trial gave me access to a specialist physiotherapist. Her knowledge was far, far superior and specific to my issue. Some mornings I get up and feel on top of the world and then the following day I have leg pain. Eventually you get to accept it, but doing the exercises helps.""

The study has benefited greatly from Bristol's Musculoskeletal Research Unit's patient involvement group, PEP-R (Patient Experience Partnership in Research) who worked closely with the STAR research team to develop the design of the programme.

Dr Vikki Wylde, Associate Professor in Musculoskeletal Health at Bristol Medical School (THS), and co-author, added: ""The new STAR care pathway provides benefit to people with pain at three months after knee replacement, but we still need more research to understand how we could prevent people from developing this pain. High-quality research to pre-operatively identify patients at high risk of developing pain after their operation is needed. These patients could be offered treatments to increase their chance of a good outcome after knee replacement.""

Nick Howells, Consultant Orthopaedic Knee Surgeon at NBT and Honorary Senior Lecturer at Bristol Medical School: THS, continued: ""Knee replacement surgery is a great operation that changes the lives of many people suffering with knee osteoarthritis, improving pain, function and quality of life, however, a proportion of people are left with ongoing pain. To have developed an intervention which has been shown to make a difference for some of these people is really satisfying for our team and a great step forward in treatment.

""We have now successfully introduced the STAR care pathway into our NHS clinical care pathway at North Bristol and hope it will be adopted in other centres across the NHS in the future.""",0
674,"March 6, 2023 -- A discredited study that falsely proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism is still having a negative effect on child vaccination rates in the United States and the United Kingdom more than two decades later, medical experts say. That appears to be the case in Columbus, Ohio, where local health authorities found that 80 of 85 children who got measles in an outbreak last year were unvaccinated. Parents said they were worried the MMR vaccine would give their children autism, a Columbus health department official told ABC News. The 1998 study conducted in the United Kingdom and published in The Lancet did not prove an association between MMR and autism, but concluded that, ""further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine."" The Lancet retracted the study after a 2004 investigation by a U.K. newspaper revealed multiple problems, including a conflict of interest for the lead researcher, Andrew Wakefield, that was not mentioned in the study. He received funding from a legal aid group that was seeking legal action on behalf of parents who believed the MMR vaccine harmed their children.

Wakefield lost his medical license and 10 of 13 co-researchers signed a letter retracting their support for the findings, but the study scared some parents away from the vaccine and led to measles outbreaks. ""It was an irresponsible publication, and it set off a firestorm,” Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News. ABC News, citing CDC data, said 90.8% of children aged 24 months have gotten at least one dose of MMR vaccine, down from the peak of 91.5% in 2003. Only 93.5% of kindergartners received both doses of the vaccine for the 2021-22 school year. That’s the lowest percentage in a decade but the COVID pandemic may be a partial cause, ABC News said. In the U.K., MMR vaccination rates went from 91% before the debunked study was published to 81% by 2004, ABC News reported, citing an independent think tank.

""We eliminated measles from the United States in the year 2000 and since then, measles has come back,"" Offit said. ""I think the summary of all that for me is that while it's very easy to scare people, it's hard to unscare them.""

679,"An enzyme that defends human cells against viruses can help drive cancer evolution towards greater malignancy by causing myriad mutations in cancer cells, according to a study led by investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine. The finding suggests that the enzyme may be a potential target for future cancer treatments.

In the new study, published Dec. 8 in Cancer Research, scientists used a preclinical model of bladder cancer to investigate the role of the enzyme called APOBEC3G in promoting the disease and found that it significantly increased the number of mutations in tumor cells, boosting the genetic diversity of bladder tumors and hastening mortality.

""Our findings suggest that APOBEC3G is a big contributor to bladder cancer evolution and should be considered as a target for future treatment strategies,"" said study senior author Dr. Bishoy M. Faltas, assistant professor of cell and developmental biology at Weill Cornell Medicine, and an oncologist who specializes in urothelial cancers at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.

The APOBEC3 family of enzymes is capable of mutating RNA or DNA -- by chemically modifying a cytosine nucleotide (letter ""C"" in the genetic code). This can result in an erroneous nucleotide at that position. The normal roles of these enzymes, including APOBEC3G, are to fight retroviruses like HIV -- they attempt to hobble viral replication by mutating the cytosines in the viral genome.

The inherent hazardousness of these enzymes suggests that mechanisms must be in place to prevent them from harming cellular DNA. However, starting about a decade ago, researchers using new DNA-sequencing techniques began to find extensive APOBEC3-type mutations in cellular DNA in the context of cancer. In a 2016 study of human bladder tumor samples, Dr. Faltas, who is also director of bladder cancer research at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, found that a high proportion of the mutations in these tumors were APOBEC3-related -- and that these mutations appeared to have a role in helping tumors evade the effects of chemotherapy.

Such findings point to the possibility that cancers generally harness APOBEC3s to mutate their genomes. This could help them not only acquire all the mutations needed for cancerous growth but also boost their ability to diversify and ""evolve"" thereafter -- enabling further growth and spread despite immune defenses, drug treatments, and other adverse factors.

In the new study, Dr. Faltas and his team, including first author Dr. Weisi Liu, a postdoctoral research associate, addressed the specific role of APOBEC3G in bladder cancer with direct cause-and-effect experiments.

APOBEC3G is a human enzyme not found in mice, so the team knocked out the gene for the sole APOBEC3-type enzyme in mice, replacing it with the gene for human APOBEC3G. The researchers observed that when these APOBEC3G mice were exposed to a bladder cancer-promoting chemical that mimics the carcinogens in cigarette smoke, they became much more likely to develop this form of cancer (76% developed cancer) compared with mice whose APOBEC gene was knocked out and not replaced (53% developed cancer). Moreover, during a 30-week observation period, all the knockout-only mice survived, whereas nearly a third of the APOBEC3G mice succumbed to cancer.

To their surprise, the researchers found that APOBEC3G in the mouse cells was present in the nucleus, where cellular DNA is kept using an 'optical sectioning' microscopy technique. Previously, this protein had been thought to reside only outside the nucleus. They also found that the bladder tumors of the APOBEC3G mice had about twice the number of mutations compared to the tumors in knockout-only mice.

Identifying the specific mutational signature of APOBEC3G and mapping it in the tumor genomes, the team found ample evidence that the enzyme had caused a greater mutational burden and genomic diversity in the tumors, likely accounting for the greater malignancy and mortality in the APOBEC3G mice. ""We saw a distinct mutational signature caused by APOBEC3G in these tumors that is different from signatures caused by other members of the APOBEC3 family"" said Dr. Liu.

Lastly, the researchers looked for APOBEC3G's mutational signature in a widely used human tumor DNA database, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and found that these mutations appear to be common in bladder cancers and are linked to worse outcomes.

""These findings will inform future efforts to restrict or steer tumor evolution by targeting APOBEC3 enzymes with drugs,"" said Dr. Faltas.",0
680,"Jan. 19, 2023 -- People who have been infected with COVID-19 and vaccinated against it are more likely to avoid serious illness than those who were only previously infected, a new study says.

It’s called “hybrid immunity” and it offers better protection from COVID reinfection, according to a study published in The Lancet.

The World Health Organization said the study shows “the advantages of vaccination even after people have had COVID-19,” Fortune reported.

People with hybrid immunity had a 95% lower risk of getting seriously sick or hospitalized a year later, the study says`. People previously infected but unvaccinated people had a lower risk, too, but just 75% lower.

“Those with hybrid immunity following their first two COVID shots were nearly 42% less likely to get reinfected with COVID a year out, and nearly 47% less likely six months out following their first booster vaccination,” Forbes wrote. “For those who had been infected but not vaccinated, protection was just 25% at 12 months.”

681,"Investigational monoclonal antibody to treat Ebola is safe in adults

The investigational Ebola treatment mAb114 is safe, well-tolerated, and easy to administer, according to findings from an early-stage clinical trial published in The Lancet. Eighteen healthy adults received the monoclonal antibody as part of a Phase 1 clinical trial that began in May 2018 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC), part of NIH, developed the investigational treatment and conducted and sponsored the clinical trial.

The investigational treatment is currently being offered to Ebola patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) under compassionate use and as part of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of multiple investigational treatments. mAb114, a single monoclonal antibody, binds to the core receptor binding domain of the Zaire ebolavirus surface protein, preventing the virus from infecting human cells. Scientists isolated the antibody from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. Prior studies showed that mAb114 can protect monkeys from lethal Ebola virus disease when given as late as five days after infection.

Participants in the Phase 1 clinical trial received a single intravenous infusion of mAb114, administered over approximately 30 minutes. Three participants received a 5 milligram(mg)/kilogram (kg) dose; five participants received a 25 mg/kg dose; and 10 participants received a 50 mg/kg dose. All infusions were well-tolerated. Four participants reported mild side effects, such as discomfort, muscle or joint pain, headache, nausea, and chills in the three days following the infusion.

As expected, levels of mAb114 in the blood increased as the dosage was increased. Investigators also observed relatively uniform levels of absorption, distribution, and elimination of mAb114 among participants.

The authors note several advantages for deploying mAb114 in an outbreak setting, including the ease and speed of its administration, and its formulation as a freeze-dried powder that does not require freezer storage. The powder is reconstituted with sterile water and added to saline for administration.

In addition to the ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial of mAb114 in the DRC, the VRC is planning to initiate another Phase 1 trial of the investigational treatment in Africa.

VRC scientists developed mAb114 in collaboration with scientists at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in the DRC; the Institute for Research in Biomedicine and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.'s subsidiary Humabs BioMed, both based in Bellinzona, Switzerland; and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded the production of mAb114 for clinical testing. The investigational treatment is licensed to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP based in Coconut Grove, Florida.

682,"July 15, 2022 – The death of a 3-year-old boy, found unresponsive after being left in a hot car, underscores the danger of leaving a child alone in a vehicle as temperatures rise. The child was found Monday outside of Lubavitch Educational Center in Miami Gardens, FL, a school where both of his parents work. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. The Miami-Dade County medical examiner confirmed the cause of death as hyperthermia, or abnormally high temperature, and ruled the death an accident, according to the Miami Herald. At the time of the child’s death, temperatures in South Florida had soared to 93 F with a heat index of 103, the report said. “This was the 11th child, at least, to die this year in a hot car,” says Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Car Safety, a nonprofit group that aims to protect children and pets in and around cars. “These are predictable and preventable tragedies.” No charges have been filed as the investigation continues. On average, 38 children under the age of 15 die each year from heatstroke after being left in a vehicle, according to noheatstroke.org. While heat-related illness can affect anyone, children are at higher risk because their bodies warm up 3 to 5 times faster than an adult bodies. At least 917 children have died due to heatstroke in a vehicle since 1998, according to noheatstroke.org, which was created by Jan Null of the Department of Meteorology & Climate Science at San Jose State University. That, along with the fact that the temperature inside a vehicle can rise 80% within 10 minutes, makes cars an especially dangerous place for children, says Janette Fennell, president and founder of Kids and Car Safety. This extreme temperature spike proves fatal when a child’s internal body temperature reaches 107 F, something that can occur within minutes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Many states have Good Samaritan laws that protect people who take action to help a child left in a car. If you see a child left in a car, the agency suggests:
• Make sure the child is OK and responsive. If unresponsive, call 911 right away.
• If the child is unresponsive, try to get into the car and help the child, even if by breaking a window.
• Try to get another person to find the child’s guardian.

Even in mild climates, leaving a child in a closed vehicle can prove fatal. For example, a recent Consumer Reports test found that on 61-degree days, the temperature inside a closed car reached 105 F in just 1 hour. “It doesn't have to be a super-hot day, because a vehicle acts like a greenhouse and heats up very quickly,” says Rollins. “You've got a recipe for disaster in a very short amount of time.” One of the solutions to this problem lies in technology, especially in programs such as occupant detection, which sounds alerts if someone is left behind in a vehicle, Fennell and Rollins say. “Until we have occupant detection, we will continue to see hot car deaths,” says Rollins. “All it takes is 1 day of forgetting or one distraction for this to happen to anybody, even the most loving and responsible parents.” Beyond tech, parents should get in the habit of checking the back seat and locking parked cars to prevent curious children from wandering in. Experts also say that it’s good practice to put cellphones or bags in the back seat, a move that forces parents to turn around and check behind them when arriving at their destination. “We need to raise so much awareness and education, and have parents take these steps so this doesn’t happen to their family,” Fennell says. “People like to create monsters out of the people this happens to, but this can and does happen to absolutely everyone.” Read more about hot car deaths and prevention here.",0

685,"A research team from the University of Cologne and the Universities of Mannheim and Heidelberg has found that even the single administration of alcohol permanently alters the morphology of neurons. In particular, the structure of the synapses as well as the dynamics of mitochondria -- the powerhouses of the cell -- are influenced by alcohol. Using the genetic model system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Professor Dr Henrike Scholz and her team members Michèle Tegtmeier und Michael Berger showed that changes in the migration of mitochondria in the synapses reduce the rewarding effect of alcohol. These results suggest that even a single consumption event can lay the foundation for alcohol addiction.

The study ""Single-dose ethanol intoxication causes acute and lasting neuronal changes in the brain"" has appeared in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).

Which changes in the brain accompany the transition from sporadic drinking to chronic alcohol abuse? That is the question a joint research project with working groups at the University of Mannheim-Heidelberg and the University of Cologne explored. Most scientific research has examined the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the hippocampus -- the control centre of our brain. Because of this, little is known about the acute neuronal interactions of critical risk factors, such as a first alcohol intoxication at an early age, explained Henrike Scholz: 'We set out to discover ethanol-dependent molecular changes. These, in turn, provide the basis for permanent cellular changes following a single acute ethanol intoxication. The effects of a single alcohol administration were examined at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels.' The working hypothesis was that, similar to the formation of memory after a single lesson, a single administration of ethanol would form a positive association with alcohol.

The team tested its hypothesis using research in fruit flies and mouse models and found ethanol-induced changes in two areas: mitochondrial dynamics and the balance between synapses in neurons. Mitochondria supply cells and especially nerve cells with energy. In order to optimally deliver the energy to the cells, the mitochondria move. The movement of the mitochondria was disturbed in the cells treated with ethanol. The chemical balance between certain synapses was also disturbed. These changes remained permanent and were confirmed by behavioural changes in the animals: Mice and fruit flies showed increased alcohol consumption and alcohol relapse later in life.

The morphological remodelling of neurons is a well-known basis for learning and memory. These so-called cellular plasticity mechanisms, which are central to learning and memory, are also thought to be at the core of the formation of associative memories for drug-related rewards. Therefore, some of the observed morphological changes may influence ethanol-related memory formation. Together with the migration of mitochondria in neurons, which are also important for synaptic transmission and plasticity, the researchers speculate that these ethanol-dependent cellular changes are critical for the development of addictive behaviours.

'It is remarkable that the cellular processes contributing to such complex reward behaviour are conserved across species, suggesting a similar role in humans,' said Henrike Scholz. 'It could be a possible general cellular process essential for learning and memory.'

Both of the observed mechanisms could explain observations made in mice that a single intoxication experience can increase alcohol consumption and alcohol relapse later in life. 'These mechanisms may even be relevant to the observation in humans that the first alcohol intoxication at an early age is a critical risk factor for later alcohol intoxication and the development of alcohol addiction,' explained Professor Scholz. 'This means that identifying lasting ethanol-dependent changes is an important first step in understanding how acute drinking can turn into chronic alcohol abuse.'",0

According to new research published in the journal PLOS Biology, people can also become selfish and less likely to help another person when they don’t get enough sleep.

""Even just an hour of sleep loss was more than enough to influence the choice to help another,"" Ben Simon, a postdoctoral fellow of psychology at the University’s Center for Human Sleep Science, told CNN. ""When people lose one hour of sleep, there's a clear hit on our innate human kindness and our motivation to help other people in need.""

In one study, charitable donations fell 10% after Daylight Savings Time. In another, there was less activity in the part of the brain associated with considering other people’s needs following sleep deprivation.

690,"An artificial intelligence (AI) tool can accurately identify normal and abnormal chest X-rays in a clinical setting, according to a study published in Radiology, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Chest X-rays are used to diagnose a wide variety of conditions to do with the heart and lungs. An abnormal chest X-ray can be an indication of a range of conditions, including cancer and chronic lung diseases.

An AI tool that can accurately differentiate between normal and abnormal chest X-rays would greatly alleviate the heavy workload experienced by radiologists globally.

""There is an exponentially growing demand for medical imaging, especially cross-sectional such as CT and MRI,"" said study co-author Louis Lind Plesner, M.D., from the Department of Radiology at the Herlev and Gentofte Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""Meanwhile, there is a global shortage of trained radiologists. Artificial intelligence has shown great promise but should always be thoroughly tested before any implementation.""

For this retrospective, multi-center study, Dr. Plesner and colleagues wanted to determine the reliability of using an AI tool that can identify normal and abnormal chest X-rays.

Researchers used a commercially available AI tool to analyze the chest X-rays of 1,529 patients from four hospitals in the capital region of Denmark. Chest X-rays were included from emergency department patients, in-hospital patients and outpatients. The X-rays were classified by the AI tool as either ""high-confidence normal"" or ""not high-confidence normal"" as in normal and abnormal, respectively.

Two board-certified thoracic (chest) radiologists were used as the reference standard. A third radiologist was used in cases of disagreements, and all three physicians were blinded to the AI results.

Of the 429 chest X-rays that were classified as normal, 120, or 28%, were also classified by the AI tool as normal. These X-rays, or 7.8 % of all the X-rays, could be potentially safely automated by an AI tool. The AI tool identified abnormal chest X-rays with a 99.1% of sensitivity.

""The most surprising finding was just how sensitive this AI tool was for all kinds of chest disease,"" Dr. Plesner said. ""In fact, we could not find a single chest X-ray in our database where the algorithm made a major mistake. Furthermore, the AI tool had a sensitivity overall better than the clinical board-certified radiologists.""

According to the researchers, further studies could be directed toward larger prospective implementation of the AI tool where the autonomously reported chest X-rays are still reviewed by radiologists.

The AI tool performed especially well at identifying normal X-rays of the outpatient group at a rate of 11.6%. This suggests that the AI model would perform especially well in outpatient settings with a high prevalence of normal chest X-rays.

""Chest X-rays are one of the most common imaging examination performed worldwide,"" Dr. Plesner said. ""Even a small percentage of automatization can lead to saved time for radiologists, which they can prioritize on more complex matters.""",0
691,"Infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans can cause meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain itself), conditions that are often lethal. To elicit these effects, the fungus must somehow leave the blood stream and enter the brain, but little is known about how it does this.

A team of researchers, at the University of Calgary, Canada, has now used a form of microscopy known as intravital microscopy, which enables researchers to observe events in real-time in live animals, to visualize in mice the process of brain invasion by Cryptococcus neoformans.

A key observation of the team, led by Christopher Mody, was that Cryptococcus neoformans stops suddenly in mouse brain capillaries that are similar or smaller in diameter than it is. Only after stopping abruptly was the fungus seen to cross the wall of the blood vessel and enter the brain. Interestingly, the protein urease was required for Cryptococcus neoformans to invade the brain, and treatment with a urease inhibitor reduced brain infection. The authors therefore suggest that therapeutics that inhibit urease might help prevent meningitis and encephalitis caused by infection with Cryptococcus neoformans.

In an accompanying commentary, Arturo Casadevall, at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, suggests that such inhibitors might not be applicable in the clinic, because most patients already have substantial brain infection when they first seek medical help. However, he highlights that the study opens up numerous new avenues of research that could be exploited in the clinic in the future.

703,"An international team of scientists has identified a gene mutation that causes aplastic anemia, a serious blood disorder in which the bone marrow fails to produce normal amounts of blood cells. Studying a family in which three generations had blood disorders, the researchers discovered a defect in a gene that regulates telomeres, chromosomal structures with crucial roles in normal cell function.

""Identifying this causal defect may help suggest future molecular-based treatments that bypass the gene defect and restore blood cell production,"" said study co-leader Hakon Hakonarson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

Hakonarson and CHOP colleagues collaborated with Australian scientists on the study, published online Sept. 9 in the journal Blood.

""We're thrilled by this discovery which has advanced our understanding of certain gene mutations and the causal relationship to specific diseases,"" said study co-leader Tracy Bryan, Ph.D., Unit Head of the Cell Biology Unit at the Children's Medical Research Institute in Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.

The research team studied an Australian family with aplastic anemia and other blood disorders, including leukemia. Hakonarson and lead analyst Yiran Guo, Ph.D., along with genomics experts from BGI-Shenzhen, performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA from the families and identified an inherited mutation on the ACD gene, which codes for the telomere-binding protein TPP1.

Telomeres, complex structures made of DNA and protein, are located on the end of chromosomes, where they protect the chromosomes' stability. They are sometimes compared to plastic tips at the end of shoelaces that prevent the laces from fraying.

Telomeres shorten after each cell division, and gradually lose their protective function. Aging cells, with their shortened telomeres, become progressively more vulnerable to DNA damage and cell death. Separately from the aging process, certain inherited and acquired disorders may shorten telomeres and injure rapidly dividing blood-forming cells produced in bone marrow. This leads to bone marrow failure, one example of which is aplastic anemia.

Bryan's team investigated the function of the ACD gene. They determined that the mutation shortened telomeres and interrupted the ability of telomeres to attract the enzyme telomerase, which counteracts telomere shortening and thus protects cells.

In the current study, the researchers showed that the mutation in ACD alters the telomere-binding protein TPP1, disrupting the interactions between telomere and telomerase. Without access to telomerase to help maintain telomeres, blood cells lose their structural integrity and die, resulting in bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia.

Nine other genes were previously found to play a role in bone marrow failure disorders. The current study adds ACD to the list, the first time the gene has been shown to have a disease-causing role.

""This improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms may suggest new approaches to treating disorders such as aplastic anemia,"" said Hakonarson. ""For instance, investigators may identify other avenues for recruiting telomerase to telomeres to restore its protective function.""",0

708,"In adolescents, oral Truvada and vaginal ring for HIV prevention are safe, acceptable

NIH-funded clinical trials are first of their kind to include younger adolescent girls.

A monthly vaginal ring and a daily oral tablet, both containing anti-HIV drugs, were safe and acceptable in studies of adolescents, two teams of investigators reported today at the 9th IAS Conference on HIV Science in Paris. The experimental ring is designed for HIV prevention and the oral tablet is already used for this purpose in adults. Adherence to the ring was high, while adherence to the tablet was moderate and diminished substantially when study visits became less frequent. These studies mark the first time the vaginal ring was tested in adolescent girls younger than 18 years and the first time a clinical trial of the oral tablet as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) specifically for adolescents included girls. The findings pave the way for larger trials of the vaginal ring and oral PrEP in this vulnerable age group.

“Adolescents and young people represent a growing share of people living with HIV worldwide,” noted Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). “Science has demonstrated that the HIV prevention needs of adolescents may be different than those of adults, which is why these new study findings are so important.”

Both trials were funded in part or in whole by NIAID.

The study of oral PrEP — called Choices for Adolescent Prevention Methods for South Africa, or CHAMPS PlusPills — is only the second clinical trial to report results of PrEP focused solely on adolescents. The NIAID-funded Phase 2 study evaluated the safety, acceptability and use of daily oral Truvada, which contains two anti-HIV drugs, as part of an HIV prevention

package for this age group. Truvada is not yet approved by any national regulatory body for use as oral PrEP in adolescents.

CHAMPS PlusPills involved 148 healthy, sexually active, HIV-uninfected South African 15- to 19-year-olds in Cape Town and Johannesburg. The group included 99 girls and 49 boys. Participants were asked to take daily oral Truvada for at least three months and up to one year if they chose to do so.

The researchers found that most participants chose to take daily oral Truvada, which was safe and tolerable for the adolescents. Although the number of participants who actually took Truvada as prescribed was lower than the number who opted in and decreased over time, nearly 40 percent were adherent by the end of the study. Only one participant became infected with HIV during the trial, a 19-year-old who had stopped taking Truvada three months before her HIV diagnosis.

During the first three months of the trial, participants had monthly study visits, and subsequent visits occurred quarterly. Participants could choose to opt out of, continue or resume taking Truvada for PrEP at every quarterly visit. All participants were followed for the entire study year. At each visit, researchers monitored participants’ health and collected blood samples to test for evidence of adherence to Truvada, which contains the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine.

At three months, tenofovir was detectable in the blood samples of 57 percent of participants, and 82 percent of participants opted to continue taking Truvada for PrEP. At six months, tenofovir was detectable in the blood samples of 38 percent of participants, and 64 percent opted to continue or resume taking Truvada. Sixty-four percent of participants also opted to continue or resume taking Truvada at nine months. At the end of the year, 38 percent of participants tested positive for tenofovir. Participants frequently cited low-grade side effects, such as nausea or headache, as the reason they stopped taking Truvada as oral PrEP.

The HIV prevention package given to all CHAMPS PlusPills study participants included HIV testing, management of sexually transmitted infections, counseling on how to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV, access to condoms, post-exposure prophylaxis (short-term anti-HIV treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure), and counseling on the ongoing need for Truvada as oral PrEP. Boys also received counseling and referral for male circumcision, which has been proven to reduce the risk of HIV infection in men.

In addition, investigators offered three optional HIV prevention components designed specifically for adolescents. Participants could elect to receive daily or weekly text messages reminding them to take their Truvada and querying if they encountered a problem. Participants also could join so-called adherence clubs, where groups of participants met regularly with a community health worker for group counseling and support for taking Truvada for PrEP. Finally, participants could receive real-time reports of the level of tenofovir in their blood during study visits.

“The trend toward lower adherence to Truvada for PrEP as study visits became less frequent parallels what was observed in a study of PrEP in adolescent gay and bisexual boys, suggesting that monthly study visits may support greater adherence to oral PrEP among adolescents over time,” said Protocol Chair and International AIDS Society President Linda-Gail Bekker, M.B.Ch.B., Ph.D. Dr. Bekker is deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.

The study results contribute to a growing body of data that could support the development of evidence-based guidelines for the use of Truvada as oral PrEP in adolescents.

More information about CHAMPS PlusPills is available on ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier NCT02213328.

Adolescent girls and young women ages 15 to 24 years are at particularly high risk for HIV infection. They accounted for 20 percent of new HIV infections among adults globally in 2015, despite composing only 11 percent of the adult population.

An earlier NIAID-funded study called ASPIRE, which enrolled women 18 to 45 years old, tested a ring that continuously releases the experimental anti-HIV drug dapivirine in the vagina over one month. The results, reported in 2016, showed 27 percent protection overall but no protection in women ages 18 to 21, likely due to low adherence. A subsequent exploratory analysis of ASPIRE study data found that using the ring most or all of the time reduced the risk of HIV infection in women by at least 56 percent.

Because some younger adolescent girls also need HIV prevention options, a Phase 2a clinical trial called MTN-023/IPM 030 was conducted in the United States to examine the safety and acceptability of the dapivirine ring among sexually active girls from 15 to 17 years old. The results of this study were reported at the Paris conference today.

Ninety-six girls enrolled at six U.S. sites were assigned at random to receive either the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring in a 3-to-1 ratio. Neither the participants nor the investigators knew who had received which ring until the end of the trial. Participants were asked to insert a new ring each month for 6 months. Researchers monitored participants’ health and gauged adherence by measuring the amount of dapivirine in blood samples and used rings.

Investigators found that the dapivirine ring was safe and acceptable to study participants. Adherence to the ring was high: drug levels in 87 percent of blood samples and 95 percent of used rings met prespecified adherence criteria. Overall, participants said they liked the ring at 93 percent of study visits. Their main concerns were keeping the ring clean and that their primary sexual partner would feel the ring during sex.

“We are encouraged by these results of the dapivirine ring in 15- to 17-year-old girls,” said Sharon Hillier, Ph.D., principal investigator of the NIH-funded Microbicide Trials Network (MTN). “The study has demonstrated that the ring is safe in U.S. teens, and now we need data on the safety and acceptability of the ring in African adolescent girls. The REACH study, scheduled to launch later this year, will generate this data.” Dr. Hillier is professor and director of reproductive infectious disease research in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

In the REACH study, MTN investigators will evaluate the safety of both the dapivirine ring and Truvada as oral PrEP among African adolescent girls and young women ages 16 to 21. REACH also will assess how study participants use the monthly ring and daily PrEP and their preferences for either or both approaches.

MTN-023/IPM 030 was conducted by the MTN and the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions, which is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The study was led by Kathleen E. Squires, M.D., at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and Katherine Bunge, M.D., at the University of Pittsburgh. NIAID, NICHD and the National Institute of Mental Health, all part of NIH, co-funded the trial. The International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) developed the dapivirine ring and provided it for this study as its regulatory sponsor.

710,"New research led by the University of Bristol has found the protein p53 plays a key role in epithelial migration and tissue repair. The findings could improve our understanding of the processes used by cells to repair tissues, and be used to identify interventions that could accelerate and improve wound repair.

Epithelial tissues are the linings that protect the body's external skin and internal cavities, and their ability to repair themself is important. ?It is known that wounded epithelia repair themself thanks to the ability of the remaining cells to start migrating, collectively, to seal the breach. Specialised migratory cells called leader cells arise from damaged epithelia, promoting epithelial migration. However, it's unclear what molecules and signals in epithelial cells make them become migratory leaders and how some wounded cells develop leader behaviour whilst some do not.

The study, funded by CRUK and Wellcome Trust and published in Scienceon [11 February], found that, when epithelial cells are damaged, the damage activates a molecular program that turns cells into migratory leader cells so that the breach can be repaired quickly. The same molecular program also makes sure that these highly migratory cells are removed when the breach is closed, so that the tissue restores its normal epithelial tissue structure.

Using a simplified model of a wound, epithelial sheets that were scratched in vitro to injure the epithelial monolayer, the researchers identified the molecular signal that makes leader cells emerge.

The study found that, following injury, cells at the border of the epithelial gap elevate p53 and p21, suggesting that the injury triggers the migratory program. Once the breach was repaired, leader cells were eliminated from the population by their healthy epithelial neighbours. The cells damaged by the wound were able to cause wound closure, but are then sacrificed to maintain a functional tissue with normal epithelial morphology.

Eugenia Piddini, Professorial Research Fellow in Cell Biology and Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in the School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) at the University of Bristol and lead senior author of this work, said: ""Our findings improve our understanding of the mechanisms used by cells to repair tissues, and could be used to develop systems that accelerate wound healing.

""p53 plays two critical roles in epithelial repair. It starts leader driven epithelial closure and once the epithelium has been repaired, p53 induces leader cell clearance.""

Dr Giulia Pilia, Research Associate in CMM at the University of Bristol and co-first author, added: ""Collective migration is important in other areas, for example in cancer, where groups of cells move together from the primary tumour to create metastases. It would be important to know if the same proteins that we identified in the wound model are at play in this situation, so that current therapeutic treatments could be modified.""

Next steps for the research will be to test whether the mechanisms that have been found in the in vitro epithelium also apply in vivo. If this is the case, the research team would like to test if they can selectively and safely induce leaders in vivo, to promote migration and tissue repair. This new-found knowledge of how leaders work could also be used to develop new therapeutic approaches that could help block the unwanted migration of metastatic cells.",0

712,"Dementia is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide, affecting thinking and behaviours as you age. But what if you could stop this degenerative disease in its tracks?

A world-first study from the University of South Australia could make this a reality as new genetic research shows a direct link between dementia and a lack of vitamin D.

Investigating the association between vitamin D, neuroimaging features, and the risk of dementia and stroke, the study found:
• low levels of vitamin D were associated with lower brain volumes and an increased risk of dementia and stroke
• in some populations as much as 17 per cent of dementia cases might be prevented by increasing everyone to normal levels of vitamin D (50 nmol/L).

Dementia is a chronic or progressive syndrome that leads to deterioration in cognitive function. About 487,500 Australians live with dementia and it is the country's second leading cause of death. Globally, more than 55 million people have dementia with 10 million new cases diagnosed every year.

Supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the genetic study analysed data from 294,514 participants from the UK Biobank, examining the impact of low levels of vitamin D (25 nmol/L) and the risk of dementia and stroke. Nonlinear Mendelian randomisation (MR) -- a method of using measured variation in genes to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease -- were used to test for underlying causality for neuroimaging outcomes, dementia, and stroke.

Senior investigator and Director of UniSA's Australian Centre for Precision Health, Professor Elina Hyppönen, says the findings are important for the prevention of dementia and appreciating the need to abolish vitamin D deficiency.

""Vitamin D is a hormone precursor that is increasingly recognised for widespread effects, including on brain health, but until now it has been very difficult to examine what would happen if we were able to prevent vitamin D deficiency,"" Prof Hyppönen says.

""Our study is the first to examine the effect of very low levels of vitamin D on the risks of dementia and stroke, using robust genetic analyses among a large population.

""In some contexts, where vitamin D deficiency is relatively common, our findings have important implications for dementia risks. Indeed, in this UK population we observed that up to 17 per cent of dementia cases might have been avoided by boosting vitamin D levels to be within a normal range.""

713,"July 17, 2022 -- Canada is reinstating its mandatory random COVID-19 testing program for international passengers arriving at the country’s four major airports.

Canada paused mandatory random testing on June 11 as part of a broader strategy to transition testing of air travelers outside of the airports. However, random testing will resume on Tuesday in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, according to a notice from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

“We need to keep border testing measures in place because that is how we track importation of the COVID-19 virus, and of new variants of concern,” Jean-Yves Duclos, the federal health minister, said in the statement.

“We will keep adapting our border measures to balance the need to protect Canadians while supporting our economic recovery,” he said.

The move comes as Canadian airports grapple with the same issues affecting air travel worldwide, including staff shortages, cancellations and delays. At Canada’s four major airports, between 10% and 27% of flights were delayed by more than 15 minutes in June, according to The New York Times.",0

Her first step: Speaking with her grandmother, Deanna Simmons, 73, a now-retired pediatric nurse who is also her Girl Scout troop leader and knew her granddaughter was looking for a unique Girl Scout Gold Award project.

“Bryn didn’t want to do a routine project,” Simmons says. “So, when a friend observed that one of the nurses at our local hospitals was making these weighted hand-shaped mitts that simulate the feeling of being held by a parent, Bryn got in contact with her.”

That person became Hammock's project advisor, and before long she was assigned a coach, who pushed Hammock to expand the project to help as many people as possible, Simmons says.

At first, Hammock planned to have the team make 30 mitts, Simmons says. But with the help of her grandmother, Hammock knew she could do more. The teen created a pattern, basically two pieces of flannel shaped like an oven mitt with a double stitch, sewn around a pound of Polyfill.",0

The increase amounts to an average of 84 more minutes per day looking at televisions, computers, and phones. That’s a jump from the pre-pandemic baseline of 162 minutes per day to 246 minutes during the pandemic, said the study published in JAMA Pediatrics.

The findings were based on data from 46 studies conducted in nations around the world. The screen habits of about 30,000 children aged 3 to 18 were studied between Jan. 1, 2020, and March 5, 2022. The biggest increase was reported in children 12-18 because they were more likely to have their own devices, the study said.

Online education did account for some of the increase, the researchers said. Also, youths relied on phones and other devices to remain in touch with friends when face-to-face interactions were discouraged because of COVID.

724,"ROCHESTER, Minn. ― Although fractures normally heal, bone will not regenerate under several circumstances. When bone does not regenerate, major clinical problems could result, including amputation.

To enhance the regeneration of bone, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2, or BMP-2. However, it is expensive and only moderately effective. It also produces side effects ― some severe.

Researchers at Mayo Clinic, along with colleagues in the Netherlands and Germany, may have a viable, less risky alternative: messenger RNA. This well-known platform for vaccines has already proven to be safe in human use by the FDA.

The findings in a study involving rats are published in Science Advances. These findings show that messenger RNA can be used at low doses to regenerate bone without side effects. Moreover, the quality of the new bone is superior to bone formed by BMP-2. The researchers also say that messenger RNA is a good choice for bone regeneration because it may not need repeat doses. Findings showed the new tissue growth that occurred after applying messenger RNA was biomechanically superior to the alternative method and remained so throughout eight weeks of monitoring.

Human bone develops in one of two ways: direct formation of bone cells from mesenchymal progenitor cells, or through endochondral ossification, in which cartilage forms first and then coverts to bone. The BMP-2 therapy uses the former method, and the messenger RNA approach uses the latter. In general, the researchers say their work proves that this method ""can heal large, critical-sized, segmental osseous defects of long bones in a superior fashion to its recombinant protein counterpart.""

The researchers say these findings in rats are limited, and studies are needed in large animals before any translation can be considered for clinical trials.

725,"June 2, 2022 – The FDA has accepted Pfizer’s application for a COVID-19 vaccine for children under age 5, which clears the way for approval and distribution in June. Pfizer announced Wednesday that it completed the application for a three-dose vaccine for kids between 6 months and 5 years old, and the FDA said it received the emergency use application. Children in this age group – the last to be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, could begin getting shots as early as June 21, according to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha, MD. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases are still high – an average of 100,000 cases a day – but death numbers are about 90% lower than when they were when President Joe Biden first took office, Jha said. The FDA’s advisory group, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, is scheduled to meet June 14 and June 15 to discuss data submitted by both Pfizer and Moderna. If the FDA gives them the green light, the CDC will then weigh in.

“We know that many, many parents are eager to vaccinate their youngest kids and it’s important to do this right,” Jha said at a White House press briefing Thursday. “We expect that vaccinations will begin in earnest as early as June 21 and really roll on throughout that week.” States can place their orders as early as Friday, Jha said, and there will initially be 10 million doses available. If the FDA gives emergency use authorization for the vaccines, the government will begin shipping doses to thousands of sites across the country. “The good news is we have plenty of supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines,” Jha said. “We’ve asked states to distribute to their highest priority sites, serving the highest risk and hardest to reach areas.” Pfizer's clinical trials that found three doses of the vaccine for children 6 months to under 5 years were safe and effective, and proved to be 80% effective against Omicron. This week, the FDA announced its meeting information, with a conversation about the Moderna vaccine for ages 6 to 17 scheduled for June 14 and a conversation about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for young children scheduled for June 15.

Moderna applied for FDA authorization of its two-dose vaccine for children under age 6 on April 28. The company said the vaccine was 51% effective against infections with symptoms for children ages 6 months to 2 years and 37% effective for ages 2 to 5. Pfizer’s 3-microgram dose is one-tenth of its adult dose. Moderna’s 25-microgram dose is one-quarter of its adult dose.",0

First, no vaccine is 100% effective. To make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Second, in a country such as the United States the people who have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not.
How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:
""in a high school of 1,000 students, none has ever had measles. All but five of the students have had two doses of measles vaccine, and so are fully immunized. The entire student body is exposed to measles, and every susceptible student becomes infected. The five unvaccinated students will be infected, of course. But of the 995 who have been vaccinated, we would expect several not to respond to the vaccine. The efficacy rate for two doses of measles vaccine can be as high as >99%. In this class, seven students do not respond, and they, too, become infected. Therefore seven of 12, or about 58%, of the cases occur in students who have been fully vaccinated.""

The results showed that for both the cell types, 6-shogaol was effective in spheroids at concentrations that were 5 or 2 fold higher than the effective inhibitory concentrations in monolayer cells. In contrast, taxol, even though was highly active in monolayer cells, did not show activity against the spheroids even at 10000 fold higher concentration compared to 6-shogaol (Table 1). Curcumin was also found to be effective against MCF-7 spheroids as reported earlier [14]. The results also showed that 6-shogaol was ~3 fold more potent against MDA-MB-231 spheroids than against MCF-7 spheroids. The inhibitory effect of all the three compounds on non-cancerous cell lines, HEK 293 and HaCaT were also tested (Table 1). The IC50 data showed that the noncancerous cells tolerated significantly higher doses of 6-shogaol compared to the cancer cells in both monolayer and spheroid culture conditions. Non-cancerous cells were quite resistant to taxol when compared with its efficacy in the monolayer breast cancer cells. In contrast, curcumin did not exhibit any resistance to noncancerous cells as compared to its action on breast cancer cells and spheroids. Thus the action of 6-shogaol on breast cancer spheroids is superior to taxol or curcumin considering the fact that it inhibits spheroids at concentrations which are safe to non cancerous cells.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Sept. 23, 2022 — The number of people living with type 1 diabetes worldwide is expected to double by 2040, with most of the new cases among adults living in low- and middle-income countries, new modelling data suggests. The forecast, developed from available data collected in the new Type 1 Diabetes Index, provides estimates for type 1 diabetes rates, associated mortality, and life expectancy for 201 countries for the year 2021. ""The worldwide prevalence of type 1 diabetes is substantial and growing. Improved surveillance — particularly in adults who make up most of the population living with type 1 diabetes — is essential to enable improvements to care and outcomes,” the authors wrote. “There is an opportunity to save millions of lives in the coming decades by raising the standard of care (including ensuring universal access to insulin and other essential supplies) and increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes to enable a 100% rate of diagnosis in all countries.

One in Five of All Deaths From Type 1 Diabetes is in the Under 25s The new findings were published in the journal Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. The T1D Index Project database was published Sept. According to the model, about 8.4 million people were living with type 1 diabetes in 2021 with one fifth from low- and middle-income countries. An additional 3.7 million died prematurely and would have been added to that count had they lived. The estimate is that about one in five of those who died because of type 1 diabetes in 2021 were younger than 25 years and had undiagnosed diabetes. ""It is unacceptable that, in 2022, some 35,000 people worldwide are dying undiagnosed within a year of onset of symptoms. There also continues to be a huge disparity in life expectancy for people with type 1 diabetes, hitting those in the poorest countries hardest,"" said Chantal Mathieu, MD, , senior vice-president of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and an endocrinologist based in Belgium. By 2040, the model predicts that between 13.5 and 17.4 million people will be living with the condition, with the largest relative increase from 2021 in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

""We defined a potential strategy for both responders and nonresponders of the drug that may help men overcome resistance and prolong survival,"" says Liewei Wang, M.D., Ph.D., the Bernard and Edith Waterman Director, Pharmacogenomics Program, Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine. Dr. Wang is the corresponding author of the study.

Dr. Wang explains that while several drug choices are available to control disease progression, many questions remain over which drugs to use in individual cases. Also, predictive biomarkers for drug resistance and sensitivity remain primarily unknown.

Abiraterone acetate is a standard treatment option for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the response rate is limited, no known biomarkers predict prognosis, and alternative therapies for those who failed treatment are unavailable.

In the Prostate Cancer Medically Optimized Genome Enhanced Therapy study, also known as PROMOTE, Mayo researchers revealed DNA sequences associated with response to abiraterone acetate to identify additional treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer resistant to all standard therapies. They identified an 11-gene drug panel that provided a new tool to individualize treatment for abiraterone acetate. A genetic testing panel is a laboratory test that looks at a select group of genes. The 11-gene panel predicted a worse prognosis for a subset of primary or metastatic patients enrolled in the study.

In the next step of their analysis in this prospective study, the researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequence data from 83 patients with metastatic biopsies before and after 12 weeks of abiraterone acetate/prednisone treatment. They identified genomic alterations associated with acquired resistance after 12 weeks of this treatment.

""We analyzed the posttreatment genomic landscape of metastatic biopsies in these patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance,"" says Hugues Sicotte, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic bioinformatician and lead author of the study. ""These results may assist with selecting alternative therapies in a subset of abiraterone acetate-resistant patients with the highest risk of having the poorest outcome.""

Dr. Sicotte says biomarkers based on the stage-specific landscape of genomic changes in prostate cancer are under investigation.

""Further studies will be needed to test these drug treatments to overcome abiraterone acetate/prednisone resistance and define subgroups of nonresponders,"" says Dr. Sicotte. ""Our goal is to incorporate these into clinical practice for physicians and patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.""

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed solid organ malignancy in the U.S., with more than 268,490 new diagnoses annually and an estimated 34,500 deaths.

739,"Obese people who drink fructose-sweetened beverages with their meals have an increased rise of triglycerides following the meal, according to new research from the Monell Center.

""Increased triglycerides after a meal are known predictors of cardiovascular disease,"" says Monell Member and study lead author Karen L. Teff, PhD, a metabolic physiologist. ""Our findings show that fructose-sweetened beverages raise triglyceride levels in obese people, who already are at risk for metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.""

Triglycerides are manufactured by the body from dietary fat and are the most common form of fat transported in blood. Although normal levels of triglycerides are essential for good health, high levels are associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis and other predictors of cardiovascular disease.

In the study, published online by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Teff and her collaborators studied 17 obese men and women. Each was admitted two times to the Clinical and Translational Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. On each admission, the subjects were given identical meals and blood was collected from an intravenous catheter over a 24-hour period. The only difference was the sweetener used in the beverages that accompanied the meals; beverages were sweetened with glucose during one admission and with fructose during the other.

Blood triglyceride levels were higher when subjects drank fructose-sweetened beverages with their meals compared to when they drank glucose-sweetened beverages. The total amount of triglycerides over a 24-hour period was almost 200 percent higher when the subjects drank fructose-sweetened beverages.

Although fructose increased triglyceride levels in all of the subjects, this effect was especially pronounced in insulin-resistant subjects, who already had increased triglyceride levels. Insulin resistance is a pre-diabetic condition often associated with obesity.

""Fructose can cause even greater elevations of triglyceride levels in obese insulin-resistant individuals, worsening their metabolic profiles and further increasing their risk for diabetes and heart disease,"" said Teff.

Fructose and glucose are forms of sugar found in both table sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup. Both fructose and glucose are present in lower concentrations in many fruits and vegetables. Although fructose tastes much sweeter than either glucose or sucrose, it typically is not used alone as a sweetener.

Future work will seek to determine how much fructose is needed to cause an increase of triglyceride levels when it is combined with glucose in beverages. Additional studies will explore the metabolic and health effects of long-term fructose intake.

In addition to her appointment at Monell, Teff serves as Associate Director for Translational Research at the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

Also contributing to the study were Peter Havel from the University of California, Davis and his colleagues Kimber Stanhope, Nancy Keim, and Bethany Cummings; Sean Adams, Ryan Grant, and Tamara Dunn from the USDA Western Human Nutrition Center; Joanne Grudziak from Monell; and Raymond R.

740,"Oct. 26, 2022 – Smokers who quit before age 35 showed a complete “reversal of risk” when compared to people who never smoked, according to a new national study. Researchers also quantified the benefit of quitting for those older than 35. The added risk of death associated with smoking was reduced by:
• None 90% for those who quit before age 45
• None 66% for those who quit at ages 45 to 64 “The distal nature of the health consequences for young smokers is a challenge for professionals trying to motivate quitting in younger age groups. Without a proximal goal, it is tempting for smokers to abandon a quit attempt with cognitions such as 'I don't really need to do it just now,'” John P. Pierce, PhD, director for Population Sciences at UC-San Diego's Moores Cancer Center, wrote in a commentary. Current smokers were twice as likely to die from any cause during the study compared to the group researchers called “never smokers,” who were defined as smoking fewer than 100 lifetime cigarettes.

Published Monday in JAMA Network Open, the study involved 551,388 U.S. participants using information collected by the CDC from 1997 to 2018. Researchers collected data for specific causes of death of participants through the end of 2019. The results echo past findings but also established whether demographic factors such as a smoker's race and gender impact the benefits of quitting. (In many areas of health research, a person's race or gender is associated with varying risks.) The researchers found that the benefits of quitting smoking in reducing risk of death are comparable across demographic groups. “Among former smokers in each racial and ethnic group, whether male or female, quitting was associated with reductions of approximately 80% of the excess mortality associated with continued smoking,” the authors stated. “These associations were generally consistent for deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lower respiratory disease.” The findings are also important for guiding stop-smoking efforts because while smoking nationwide has decreased, the reduction has varied across demographic groups. “Monitoring the association of smoking with mortality by race, ethnicity, and sex is critical to understanding how the U.S. tobacco epidemic continues to evolve over time and who is most affected by the changes,” the authors stated. “Despite continued decreases in U.S. smoking prevalence in recent decades progress has not been equal across demographic groups. Recent progress in raising the quit ratio among U.S. ever smokers overall has been modest, and the quit ratio has been consistently lower among Black and Hispanic ever smokers than among non-Hispanic White ever smokers.”",0

People who lost weight but regained some of it experienced sustained health improvements for at least 5 years after the initial weight loss, a new study says. The prolonged benefits included lowered risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

“Many doctors and patients recognize that weight loss is often followed by weight regain, and they fear that this renders an attempt to lose weight pointless,” said University of Oxford professor and researcher Susan A.

743,"Using bacteria of the Bartonella henselae species, researchers from Goethe University, Frankfurt University Hospital, the Paul Ehrlich Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines in Langen, and the University of Oslo demonstrated for the first time that antibodies can prevent certain surface proteins of bacterial pathogens from entering host cells. The findings are important for the development of new drugs against highly resistant infectious agents.

Infections, especially those with highly resistant pathogens, pose a significant threat to human health. It is dangerous when pathogens manage to colonize the organism and subsequently cause severe infections. The first step in such an infection always consists of the pathogens attaching themselves to the host cells' surface. From here, the infections spread, resulting, for example, in infections of deeper tissue layers and organs.

A group of scientists surrounding Prof. Volkhard Kempf from Frankfurt University Hospital's Institute of Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene has now succeeded in blocking this adhesion mechanism in a bacterium, thereby preventing the infection of host cells. For this purpose, the researchers examined the pathogen Bartonella henselae, usually causing cat scratch disease. Transmitted by cats, the disease mainly affects young children, whose symptoms include swollen and hardened lymph nodes around the site of infection -- usually following a scratch or bite injury caused by infected cats.

Bartonella bacteria infect so-called endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels. Via their surface protein Bartonella adhesin A (BadA), they attach themselves to a protein (fibronectin) of the so-called ""extracellular matrix,"" a network of protein fibers that lie on top of the endothelial cells.

To determine which parts of the BadA protein are important in the bacterial adhesion process, the researchers equipped Bartonella bacteria with various genetically modified BadA variants, among others, and then analyzed the extent to which these variants were still able to bind fibronectin. Once it was clear which BadA segments were responsible for the binding, the team produced antibodies against them, using cell culture experiments to show for the first time that such antibodies can prevent infection by such bacteria.

Prof. Volkhard Kempf explains: ""Bartonella henselae is not a very dangerous pathogen, and in most cases, cat scratch disease does not require any specific medical treatment. However, for us Bartonella henselae is a very important model organism for far more dangerous pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, a serious pathogen that usually causes wound infection or pneumonia and often shows resistance to several last-choice antibiotics. The BadA protein of Bartonella henselae belongs to the so-called 'trimeric autotransporter adhesins', which are also responsible for adhesion to human cells in Acinetobacter and a number of other pathogens. A drug-induced blocking of these adhesins is therefore a promising novel and future approach to combat dangerous bacterial infections.""",0

747,"ALS gene may be a hitchhiker’s guide to the neuron

Affecting at least 14,000 Americans, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralyzing and highly fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there are no effective treatments. Scientists peered inside neurons and watched the workings of annexin A11, a gene linked to a rare form of ALS. They found that neurons may normally use the gene to ship internal housekeeping instructions via a newly discovered “hitchhiking” system and that disease-causing mutations may tie up deliveries at the cell’s loading docks. The study, published in Cell, was led by researchers in labs overseen by Michael Ward, M.D., Ph.D., investigator at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health; Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Ph.D., senior group leader at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus; and Peter St. George-Hyslop, M.D., Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research., United Kingdom.

Neurons, like other cells, constantly manufacture proteins, the cell’s workhorses. Instructions for making proteins are encoded in chromosomal DNA and stored in the nucleus. Manufacturing starts when DNA instructions are transcribed into RNAs, which are packaged as granules and transported out of the nucleus to other parts of the cell for assembly. Unlike in other cells, RNA in neurons may have to travel over great distances - sometimes up to four feet - down stringy axons or through dendritic branches. Using advanced live cell microscopy, the researchers found that annexin A11 plays a role in this process by helping RNA granules hitch rides onto traveling lysosomes. Until recently, lysosomes were mainly viewed as garbage cans that roam around inside of cells cleaning up waste. These unexpected results suggest that lysosomes might moonlight as RNA transporters.

They also found that disease-causing mutations in annexin A11 prevented hitchhiking, which, in turn, prevented RNA from being delivered to the far reaches of neurons. Many genetic studies have found that ALS is often caused by mutations in genes known to play roles in either RNA processing or the control of lysosomes. These results suggest that there is a link between these seemingly different processes and that understanding this type of hitchhiking in neurons may lead to new treatments for ALS.

748,"July 12, 2022 – The BA.5 Omicron subvariant is dominating now and accounts for 65% – or about two-thirds – of the virus causing COVID-19 in the United States, federal officials said on Tuesday. Although no evidence yet points to BA.5 causing more severe disease, hospitalization numbers are up in the past few months and case numbers are on the rise with this highly transmissible strain of the virus. But the White House and public health officials say they are ready. ""The fact that BA.5 is now the dominant variant subvariant in the United States is not a surprise,"" Ashish Jha, MD, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said at a news briefing Tuesday by the White House COVID-19 Response Team and health officials. ""We are prepared. We have been planning for this moment."" If people follow CDC recommendations for masking in high- and medium-risk places, stay up to date on vaccinations, seek antiviral treatment as soon as they test positive, and follow other familiar public health measures, ""we can get through whatever Mother Nature throws at us in the next 4, 6, or 8 weeks ahead, and also whatever Mother Nature throws at us this fall and winter,"" Jha said. The White House also released a fact sheet outlining its plan with more detail on management of BA.5. One major message out of the briefing is that not enough older Americans have received their fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose, also known as a second booster. ""For people who are 50 years of age or older, my message is simple,"" Jha said. “If you have not gotten a vaccine shot in the year 2022 … go, get one now. It could save your life."" For example, only 28% of those 50 and older have received a second booster so far, she said, and the figure is 34% for Americans 65 and older. ""It's essential that these Americans get their second booster shot right away."" Walensky also shared data from April 2022 showing that people 50 and older vaccinated with a primary series and one booster dose have four times the risk of dying, compared to people immunized with a primary series and two or more booster doses.

""That extra booster dramatically lowers your risk of getting into the hospital, going to the ICU, and dying,"" Jha said. ""There are very few things we do in medicine that have the kind of benefit that we see from that extra shot."" Boosters remain important, said Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Immunity wanes whether it's immunity after infection or immunity after vaccination, ""even though the immediate protection following infection or vaccine is generally good protection."" Asked about expanding second booster shots to all Americans, the experts said that’s being considered, but there is no firm timeline on when the FDA might authorize it. Walensky also addressed the question of whether to boost now or wait for the variant-specific vaccines expected this fall. ""The reason to get a booster now is to prevent infection now. There's a lot of infections now and an increasing number of hospitalizations,” she said. More People in the Hospital The 7-day average of hospital admissions is 5,135 per day, or up 0.6%, Walensky said. ""And while this represents only a slight increase week over week, it does represent a doubling of hospital admissions since early May."" Fauci pointed out that BA.5 is not linked with more severe illness or hospitalization rates, compared to earlier Omicron subvariants. But because the overall number of cases is growing with BA.5, more people are in the hospital overall, he explained. The number of people hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 as of July 9 was 16,631, CDC data shows. On the same day, 3,380 people nationwide were newly admitted. (For comparison, the most people hospitalized in a day this year for COVID-19, 22,920, was on January 12.) What’s more, about 300 to 350 Americans continue to die every day from COVID-19. ""That is unacceptable. It's too high,"" Jha said. ""We will continue to use the infrastructure we have built and the tools we have to lower suffering and death as we manage BA 5.""

Paxlovid continues to be able to treat COVID-19 early in the illness, Jha said. ""This is an oral antiviral that reduces the risk of hospitalizations and death by 90%,” he said. ""If you test positive in the days and weeks ahead, please consult your health care provider about your eligibility for treatment, or please visit a test-and-treat location where you can get tested and treated all in one place.” Jha recommended testing for COVID-19 before attending a large indoor gathering or visiting with a high-risk, immunocompromised person. ""You don't want to be the person who brings COVID to your grandparents or COVID to a wedding."" Fauci noted that the monoclonal antibody bebtelovimab, authorized for emergency use by the FDA in February, appears effective for treating mild to moderate COVID-19. ""The bottom line is don't panic on BA.5,"" Fauci said. ""We should not let it disrupt our lives, but we cannot deny that it is a reality that we need to deal with."" Higher numbers of infections related to COVID-19 can also mean more people at risk for long COVID. Jha said the Biden administration takes long COVID ""very seriously"" and is working on ways to prevent and care for people who have persistent symptoms. Long COVID is likely more than one clinical condition, and more work is needed to understand and tease that apart, he said. Fauci said it's critical to continue developing the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. ""The vaccines we have right now are terrific; they have saved millions of lives. But given the virus and how quickly it's evolving, it continues to pose a challenge and we have to constantly be updating these vaccines to meet what's happening."" ""We are closely monitoring BA.5,"" Jha continued. ""We're encouraged that serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained relatively low, based on the level of infections."" ""That's not by coincidence. It's not random,"" he said. ""It's in large part due to our successful vaccination program, our efforts to get people boosted, and our incredibly focused effort on making sure that treatments and testing are widely available.""",0

751,"How is the activity of genes regulated by the packaging of DNA? To answer this question, a technique to measure both gene expression and DNA packaging at the same time was developed by Franka Rang and Kim de Luca, researchers from the group of Jop Kind (group leader at the Hubrecht Institute and Oncode Investigator). This method, EpiDamID, determines the location of modified proteins around which the DNA is wrapped. It is important to gather information about these modifications, because they influence the accessibility of DNA, thereby affecting the gene activity. EpiDamID is therefore valuable for research into the early development of organisms. The results of the study are published in Molecular Cell on April 1, 2022.

In order to fit DNA into the nucleus of a cell, it is tightly packed around nuclear proteins: histones. Depending on the tightness of this winding, the DNA can be (in)accessible to other proteins. This therefore determines whether the process of gene expression, translation of DNA into RNA and eventually into proteins, can take place.

The tightness of DNA winding around histones is regulated by the addition of molecular groups, so-called post-translational modifications (PTMs), to the histones. For example, if certain molecules are added to the histones, the DNA winding is loosened. This makes the DNA more accessible for certain proteins and causes the genes in this part of the DNA to become active, or expressed. Furthermore, proteins that are crucial for gene expression can directly recognize and bind the PTMs. This enables transcription: the process of DNA copying.

The regulation of gene expression, for instance through PTMs, is also known as epigenetic regulation. Since all cells in a body have the same DNA, regulation of gene expression is needed to (de)activate specific functions in individual cells. For instance, heart muscle cells have different functions than skin cells, thus require different genes to be expressed.

To understand how PTMs affect gene expression, first authors Franka Rang and Kim de Luca designed a new method to determine the location of the modifications. Using this approach, called EpiDamID, researchers can analyze single cells, whereas previous methods were only able to measure a large group of cells. Analysis on such a small scale results in knowledge on how DNA winding differs per cell, rather than information on the average DNA winding of many cells.

EpiDamID is based on DamID, a technique which is used to determine the binding location of certain DNA-binding proteins. Using EpiDamID, the binding location of specific PTMs on histone proteins can be detected in single cells. Compared to others, a great advantage of this technique is that researchers need very limited material. Furthermore, EpiDamID can be used in combination with other methods, such as microscopy, to study regulation of gene expression on different levels.

Following the development of this technique, the Kind group will focus on the role of PTMs from the point of view of developmental biology. Because single cells are analyzed using EpiDamID, only a limited amount of material is needed to generate enough data. This allows researchers to study the early development of organisms from its first cell divisions, when the embryo consists of only a few cells.",0

758,"According to a new study out of Finland, hormonal birth control may not actually contribute to an increased rate of suicide. Mindful Media/Getty Images
• A new study challenges the idea that hormonal birth control may lead to an increased risk of suicide.
• The researchers studied more than half a million women in Finland and found that individuals not taking contraceptives had a 37 percent increased risk of attempting suicide — the findings were even more pronounced among women over the age of 19.
• Experts agree that the findings offer a hopeful message but stress that the research is still preliminary and that more analysis is required. Approximately 14 percent of women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 49 . Hormonal contraceptives are among the most widely used pharmaceutical products in the nation. Up until recently, however, research stated that hormonal contraception use doubled the risk of suicide attempts, and tripled the risk of suicide, according to a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry. But new a new observational study, which was recently presented at the European Congress of Psychiatry, may actually be flipping the previous thinking on its head. This newer research, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, has shown that the rates of attempted suicides in women using hormonal contraception are actually lower than in women who do not use hormonal contraception. “This study reviews the complex relationship between hormonal contraceptives — including pills, implants, patches, and rings — and suicidal behavior. Prior studies suggested that hormonal contraceptives are associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts, however, this large European study shows that the rates of suicide attempts in women using hormonal contraception are in fact lower than in women who did not use hormonal contraception,” said Dr. Ami Baxi, a psychiatrist at New York’s Lenox Hill Hospital.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Helsinki, who used several Finnish databases to compare attempted suicide rates from the years 2017 to 2019 of those who use hormonal contraceptives and those who do not. The study looked at more than 587,000 women (about half of the women between the ages of 15-49 in Finland). About half of the women included in the study reported the use of hormonal contraceptives, such as pills, patches, or rings. According to Lead Researcher Dr. Elana Toffol, the purpose of the research was actually to verify the previous data, so their actual findings came as a surprise. What the study found is that suicide rates dropped in older age groups, with a great drop in those who use hormonal contraceptives users as opposed to non-users. The suicide rates between hormonal contraceptive users and non-users were similarly high in the group between the ages of 15-19, though suicide rates are higher in younger women in general. According to the findings, women not using contraceptives had a 37 percent greater odds of attempting suicide in comparison with those using hormonal contraceptives. It shows that women with no psychiatric history and using hormonal contraceptives, specifically those containing ethinylestradiol (a synthetic estrogen), had a significantly reduced risk of attempting suicide than women not using any hormonal contraception.

Why was hormonal contraception considered a factor for suicide? In general, women have a higher lifetime prevalence of mood or anxiety disorders than men, according to the World Health Organization. Hormonal contraceptives are often associated with mood changes, as well. “So, despite looking to verify previous data which indicated an increased risk of suicide attempts in women on hormonal contraceptives, this study provides a pleasant surprise for women who use or are considering hormonal contraceptives,” said Baxi.

Should women still consider hormonal birth control? Which contraception to use is a personal decision that each individual woman should make, with consultation from her doctor. However, for women who were hesitant to take hormonal birth control, this study may present a different, more hopeful perspective. Still, this is one study and more research would have to be performed. “Although this is great preliminary news for women taking or considering taking hormonal contraceptives, additional clinical considerations need to be taken with one’s physician,” said Baxi. “Further studies will also need to be done to replicate these findings.” “Of course, this striking finding deserves a careful evaluation and needs to be replicated in different cohorts of women and controlled for the impact of several psychosocial stressors, such as economic upheavals, social insecurity, and uncertainty due to the COVID pandemic,” said Associate Professor of Psychiatry Andrea Fiorillo of the University of Campania, Naples, in a statement. “The clinical implications of the study are obvious and may help to de-stigmatize the use of hormonal contraceptives.”",0

Cities under heat advisories include El Paso, Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, New Orleans, and Nashville. Cities under the most extreme alert -- an excessive heat warning -- include Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Phoenix, and Tucson, according to CNN. A strong cold front will move through the Southwest this week to bring the temperatures down before summer officially starts, CNN reported.

766,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Winter is a wonderful time of year, especially if you can avoid slipping, falling and getting hurt.

Sanjeev Kakar M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon who specializes in injuries to the hand and wrist, treats his share of injuries during the winter.

Here are some of the common injuries Dr. Kakar sees and how he treats them:

Frostbite happens when the skin and underlying tissues freeze. Mild frostbite ― the earliest stage of the condition ― is known as frostnip.

""It's a spectrum. With the milder forms, you can get some pain and some numbness of the fingertips, and the skin can change its color,"" Dr. Kakar says. ""It can be red, white or blue. Blisters can also develop on your hands, and it can be a very serious injury.""

Frostbite is more common than people think, Dr. Kakar says. He sees frostbite when the temperature is 5 degrees Fahrenheit with minimal windchill. If the windchill drops to 15 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, frostbite can set in within 30 minutes.

The fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin are especially at risk. Exposed skin in cold, windy weather is most vulnerable, but frostbite can occur on skin covered by gloves and clothing.

You can treat frostnip at home with first-aid care, as the skin is not permanently damaged. Beyond that, seek medical attention because frostbite can permanently damage skin, muscle, bone and other tissue. Depending on the severity of the injury, treatments could include medications, wound care or surgery.

Dr. Kakar also sees a rise in wrist injuries immediately after winter storms, especially among older people whose bones may be fragile because of conditions like osteopenia or osteoporosis. However, he also sees snowboarders, skiers and ice skaters who have broken their wrists during their activities.

Treatments can include a splint, cast or surgery. In most cases, Dr. Kakar says four to six weeks in a cast to let the bone heal may be needed, assuming it's aligns properly. Sometimes surgery is needed. Surgeons then place plates, screws or pins to stabilize the broken bone so it can heal correctly.

Dr. Kakar says he sees many broken wrists during holiday merriment. People fall, don't realize they're hurt and wake up sore. It's best to get your injury checked out as soon as possible. If you must walk in snow or on ice, take it slow and have something or someone to hold onto in case you start to fall.

""Skier's thumb"" happens when the skier falls — while the ski pole is planted — onto an outstretched hand or thumb, or the pole pulls against the hand and tears the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb. The ligament can be partially torn or completely ruptured. Most of the time, X-rays are negative for fracture, though it's possible to have an avulsion, or chip fracture, Dr. Kakar says.

Symptoms of skier's thumb include tenderness, pain and swelling, as well as instability of the thumb knuckle, or metacarpophalangeal joint. If the patient's thumb is stable, Dr. Kakar can treat the injury with a splint or cast for four to six weeks. Surgery may be necessary with unstable joints, complete ruptures or fractures.

""It's an outpatient procedure. We repair the ligament back down to the bone,"" Dr. Kakar says. ""After that, patients go to a hand therapist who can help get them back to their activities and out of a cast much quicker, as surgical techniques have advanced.""

Besides skiing, thumb ulnar collateral ligament injuries can happen in a number of sports that require hand-held equipment, or hand or ball contact ― or, for example, if you fall off a bicycle and the thumb catches the handlebar. A chronic version ― called ""gamekeeper's thumb"" ― occurs when repeated motions gradually stretch and tear the ligament.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found glyphosate in the urine samples of 1,885 of 2,310 people tested. Almost a third of the samples came from minors. The survey is part of a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program.

""Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the country, yet until now we had very little data on exposure,"" Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist at the Environmental Working Group, said Monday in a statement. ""Children in the U.S. are regularly exposed to this cancer-causing weedkiller through the food they eat virtually every day.""

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in the Roundup brand, “which was inherited by German pharmaceutical company Bayer when it purchased American agrochemical giant Monsanto in 2018,” CBS News reported.

Bayer says the product is safe. It has won four trials against other people claiming they got cancer from Roundup. And in 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency said that glyphosate poses no serious health risk and is “not likely” to cause cancer.",0
771,"Every year, 150 to 300 children in the United States are diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), aggressive and lethal tumors that grow deep inside the brain, for which there are no cures. In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health, researchers showed that experimental drugs designed to lower the body’s natural production of alpha-ketoglutarate extended the lives of mice harboring DIPG tumors by slowing the growth of the cancer cells. Interestingly, they also found that artificially raising alpha-ketoglutarate levels with DIPG-causing genes may slow the growth of other brain tumors. The results, published in Cancer Cell, were part of a nationwide study that explored the cyclical role that cancer cell metabolism may play in regulating brain tumor genes.

Led by senior author Sriram Venneti, M.D., Ph.D., and a team of researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, the researchers primarily studied H3K27M tumors, DIPGs linked to mutations in a gene, called histone 3. Histones are proteins cells spool chromosomes around. This helps cells cram lengthy chromosomes into tiny nuclei and control gene activity. Any genes that are buried in the spools cannot be read and are thus turned off. Cells can “epigenetically” fine tune spooling by using a process known as methylation to chemically tag histones. For years scientists knew that cancer genes often alter the metabolism of tumors. In this study, the researchers not only found that this may be true for patients with H3K27M tumors but also that these alterations in metabolism may be part of a feedback loop involving alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), that epigenetically keeps these and other brain tumors in a cancerous state.

Brain scans of H3K27M patients showed that they had higher levels of certain precursor metabolites – namely glucose and glutamine - than patients with deep brain tumors who do not carry the H3K27M mutations. Then through a series of detailed experiments on mice and cells in petri dishes, the researchers found that H3K27M mutations induced the cancer cells to produce high levels of α-KG and this, in turn, spurred more growth. Further results suggested that this happened because α-KG prevented methylation of histones and thus epigenetically kept genes that are vital for cancer cells exposed and active. For instance, lowering α-KG levels with experimental drugs increased histone methylation, slowed cancer cell growth, and helped mice harboring the DIPG tumors live longer. In contrast, they saw surprisingly opposite results in lower grade tumors associated with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1), which naturally produce lower levels of α-KG. Introducing H3K237M genes into IDH1 tumors slowed growth by raising alpha-ketoglutarate levels which, in turn, increased methylation and turned off cancer-sustaining genes. The researchers concluded that understanding the intricate details behind these feedback loops may help researchers devise effective ways to treat DIPG and other brain tumors.

779,"A study from the University of Southern California (USC) suggests people of Mexican-American descent who have genetic variants of fat gene FTO and Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) had higher triglyceride and lower HDL levels.

""Our results confirm the association between FTO and fat mass and indicate that the 5-LO promoter modifies the association between FTO and lipid levels,"" says Mary Helen Black, candidate for PhD in Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology, at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and lead author of the study. ""The genetic interaction between 5-LO and FTO was significantly associated with an inverse relationship between triglycerides and HDL levels.""

The study examined 1286 participants from 165 Mexican American family members of a proband with a history of gestational diabetes and 107 control trios from the BetaGene study. Results suggest subjects who have the FTO rs9939609 A allele and at least one 5-LO short repeat allele had a 26 percent higher triglyceride count and 8 percent lower HDL cholesterol levels compared to participants with the FTO TT genotype. In contrast, among participants with two 5-LO long repeat alleles, those with an FTO A allele showed very little change in triglycerides or HDL compared to those with the FTO TT genotype.

""Understanding the interaction between these genes may help us understand the mechanism by which FTO affects adiposity. Because obesity and dyslipidemia are often precursors to diabetes, these gene interactions may play a vital role in future drug target development, which is another step toward advancing personalized medicine,"" Black says.

780,"Researchers have discovered in mice how one of the few genes definitively linked to schizophrenia, called SETD1A, likely confers risk for the illness. Mice genetically engineered to lack a functioning version of the enzyme-coding gene showed abnormalities in working memory, mimicking those commonly seen in schizophrenia patients. Restoring the gene’s function corrected the working memory deficit. Counteracting the gene’s deficiencies also repaired neuronal circuit deficits in adult mice – suggesting clues for potential treatment strategies. A team of scientists led by Joseph Gogos, M.D., Ph.D., of Columbia University, New York City, reported on their research – supported by the National Institutes of Health – in Neuron.

“You could call SETD1A a master regulator,” explained David Panchision Ph.D., of the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which co-funded the study. “This schizophrenia risk gene codes for an enzyme that influences the expression of many other genes. In mice, a hobbled version of SETD1A disrupted gene expression in a network harboring other genomic suspects in schizophrenia. Remarkably, the resulting abnormalities were reversible.”

Researchers have identified both common and rare genetic variations that contribute to risk for schizophrenia. Mutant SETD1A is one of just a few rare genes known to unequivocally confer risk for schizophrenia. While common genetic variations linked to schizophrenia individually exert only tiny effects on risk, having just one mutant copy of SETD1A is sufficient to confer a large increase in disease risk. SETD1A plays a key role in epigenomic regulation – the switching on-and-off of genes in response to experience – a molecular process widespread in the brain. Mutations in SETD1A have primarily been found in people with schizophrenia, suggesting that this rare gene variation might hold important clues to the underlying disease process.

To find out how such a mutation in SETD1A affects brain cells, circuits, and behavior, Gogos and colleagues modeled the effects in mice carrying a mutation that halves the gene’s expression.

The genetically-altered mice faltered on tasks requiring navigation of a maze to receive a reward. The tasks test the animals’ working memory – holding information in mind and retrieving it to guide behavior – an ability often impaired in schizophrenia.

The mutated gene also disrupted the cellular machinery by which neurons communicate with each other. For example, it stunted the growth and branching of cell extensions and reduced the number of spines on these extensions, which are needed to relay chemical signals from neighboring cells into electrical impulses.

Underlying such impaired neuronal growth and function, the researchers discovered that the mutant SETD1A gene disrupted regulation of many other genes with which it is networked. Whole classes of genes were under-expressed while others were over-expressed, depending on their relationship to the gene. One class overlapped conspicuously with genetic variation associated with schizophrenia in key (pyramidal) neurons of the brain’s outer mantel, or cortex, with likely cumulative effects on cellular structure and function, suggest the researchers.

Experimentally reinstating normal expression of SETD1A in adult mice restored the animals’ working memory function. Moreover, inhibiting expression of a gene called LSD1, which counteracts SETD1A, corrected all of the animals’ behavioral and neuronal communication abnormalities. Evidence indicated that many of these mechanisms identified in mouse brain have been conserved through evolution and likely play similar roles in humans.

Reactivating SETD1A function or counteracting downstream effects of SETD1A deficiency in the adult brain, perhaps with LSD1 inhibitors, may hold promise for treating schizophrenia’s cognitive deficits, suggest the researchers.

“Although SETD1A mutations exist in a small percentage of all schizophrenia patients, many people diagnosed with the disorder have issues similar to those caused by this mutation,” explained Gogos. “Thus, therapies that are specific to SETD1A may indeed have wider implications for schizophrenia as a whole.”

The clinicians examined an 18-year-old woman who was infected with COVID-19 after being exposed by her father. She completely recovered from COVID-19, testing negative a few days later, but started experiencing some additional symptoms. The young woman had neck and thyroid pain, fever and an increased heart rate. She was sent back to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis. She had normal thyroid functioning and imaging just one month earlier.

Spending time outdoors can improve overall health and wellness. The outdoors offers many opportunities to be physically active. Time outdoors may also promote mental health and stress reduction. While enjoying the benefits of being outdoors, people can decrease skin cancer risk from too much UV exposure by using sun protection.Protect yourself by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying and re-applying a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher.
Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can stimulate production of vitamin Dexternal icon in the skin. Having little or no sun exposure may put a person at risk for low levels of vitamin D, but too much UV exposure from the sun or artificial sources can increase risk of skin cancers and eye disease. CDC data show that most people in the United States are getting enough vitamin D. The amount of vitamin D a person's skin makes when they are in the sun depends on many factors, including skin tone, geographic location, weather conditions, time of year, and time of day.
The skin can produce only a limited amount of vitamin D at one time. Once the body has reached this limit, spending more time in the sun will not continue to increase vitamin D levels. However, continued time in the sun will increase your skin cancer risk. There is no known level of UV exposure that would increase vitamin D levels without also increasing skin cancer risk. Vitamin D can be obtained safely through food and dietary supplements without the risks associated with overexposure to UV.

785,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — New diagnoses for two types of skin cancer increased in recent years, according to a Mayo Clinic-led team of researchers.

Their paper, published today in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, uses medical records from the Rochester Epidemiology Project to compare diagnoses of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma ─ both nonmelanoma skin cancers ─ between 2000 and 2010 to diagnoses in prior years. The Rochester Epidemiology project is a medical records linkage system and research collaborative in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Age, sex lead to different diagnoses

 The researchers report that, between 2000 and 2010, squamous cell carcinoma (also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma) diagnoses increased 263 percent, and basal cell carcinomas increased 145 percent. They compared the 2000-2010 period to two other segments of time: 1976-1984 and 1985-1992.

Women 30-49 experienced the greatest increase in basal cell carcinoma diagnoses; whereas, women 40-59 and 70-79 experienced the greatest increase in squamous cell carcinomas.

Men had an increase in squamous cell carcinomas between the first and second time period studied (1976-1984 and 1985-1992), but experienced a slight decline in the 2000-2010 period. However, for basal cell carcinomas, men over 29 showed similar increases in diagnoses in the 2000-2010 period than the two earlier periods.

Tanning: Beautifying or death-defying?

 “We know that the sun and some artificial sunlight sources give off skin-damaging ultraviolet, or UV, rays,” says Christian Baum, M.D., a Mayo Clinic dermatologist and the study’s senior author. “This skin damage accumulates over time and can often lead to skin cancer.”

“Despite the fact that sunscreens and cautionary information have been widely available for more than 50 years, we saw the emergence of tanning beds in the 1980s, and tanning – indoors or out – was a common activity for many years.”

Although Dr. Baum notes that tanning has slowed, tanning beds still exist, and beaches will never be empty. But what people should remember is that the damage accumulates, he says, and “eventually those blistering sunburns of your youth and hot, reddened skin, and peeling shoulders of your adulthood can add up to one or more skin cancers.”

The authors also reported that shifts in exposure to UV light may be the reason for a location shift in where the cancer tumors are found. In the earlier time periods, both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas were diagnosed more often on the head and neck. But, in the most recent time period, the records showed that basal cell tumors on the torso increased, as did squamous cell carcinomas on the arms and legs.

Dr. Baum says that the risk of cancer should provide the ultimate argument for using sunscreen – every day, year-round on all exposed skin.

“Use sunscreen,” says Dr. Baum. “This includes on your left arm for those who do a lot of driving. UV rays can penetrate car windows and exposed skin ─ even when the sun isn’t shining. UV rays bounce around under the clouds, off the snow, buildings, and more, causing damage ─ even on gray days.”

More on the data

 Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system, the research team was able to identify nearly all of the Olmsted County, Minnesota, adult residents who received an initial diagnosis of the most common nonmelanoma skin cancers — basal or squamous cell carcinoma (or both), during the 2000-2010 period and the comparison years.

“There is no tumor registry for these types of cancer,” says Dr. Baum, “So it is difficult to have accurate estimates of the national or worldwide impact of these cancers. However, because the Rochester Epidemiology Project contains health care information for virtually all residents of Olmsted County since 1966, it provides a good proxy for information on many global population health concerns.”

788,"Some studies suggest women can outperform men in longer distances and colder temperatures.
• Experts say men still outperform women in many sports due to greater muscle mass and other physical attributes.
• However, new research indicates women can perform better in longer distances and in colder temperatures.
• Experts also note that women are entering sports at younger ages, a factor that also helps close the competition gap. It’s been nearly 5 years since tennis legend John McEnroe ignited controversy by saying if Serena Williams — arguably one of the most dominant tennis players in the sport’s history — would “be like 700 in the world” if she competed against men. McEnroe said this when an interviewer asked why he described Williams as “the best female player” rather than “the best player in the world, period.” “Maybe at some point, a women’s tennis player can be better than anybody. I just haven’t seen it in any other sport, and I haven’t seen it in tennis. I suppose anything’s possible at some stage,” McEnroe said. We may be getting closer to that “anything” being possible, at least in some sports valuing extreme endurance and extreme conditions, according to studies published since McEnroe made his remarks.

Since those comments in 2017, more studies are showing that women are closing performance gaps in ultramarathons and ultra-cycling events. In addition, some women have already equaled or surpassed men in older age groups when it comes to long-distance swimming. It seems that men, with frames built for bigger and more explosive muscle mass with lower percentages of body fat, are built for better speed in shorter races. However, the longer the distance and colder the conditions, the better women do in comparison. According to research published in 2020: “In open-water long-distance swimming events of the ’Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming’ with the ’Catalina Channel Swim’, the ’English Channel Swim’ and the ’Manhattan Island Marathon Swim’, women were about 0.06 km/h faster than men.” In addition, researchers wrote, “when factoring in pool swimming as well, while females gained ground on superior male swimmers during middle years, younger age groups (up to 10 years old) and older groups (older than 75 to 80 years old) often exceeded men.” “Two main variables may explain why women can swim faster than men in open-water swimming events: (i) the long distance of around 30 km, (ii) and water colder than ~20 °C.,” researchers concluded Ultra-cycling is another sport in which the longer the race, the better women do versus men. An April 2020 study looked at data from 1996 to 2018 from the Ultra-Cycling Marathon Association (UMCA), including races of 100, 200, 400, and 500 miles. A total of 12,716 race results were analyzed in age groups of 18 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 59, and 60 and older. “Men were faster than women in 100 and 200 mile races, but no sex differences were identified for the 400 and 500 mile races,” researchers concluded. The performance ratio of cycling speed was smaller in the 200-mile races than the 100-mile races and remained stable in the 400- and 500-mile races. “In all race distances, the difference in average cycling speed between women and men decreased with increasing age,” researchers wrote. “The gender gap in performance was closed in several distance-limited ultra-cycling races, such as the 400 and 500 mile races.” Researchers said in “distance-limited ultra-cycling races (100–500 miles) held from 1996 to 2018, men were faster than women for all race distances. Men showed greater participation than women.” However, as the races got longer, the women performed better. “The gender gap decreased in distance-limited ultra-cycling races when race distance and age increased. This finding may empower women to compete in longer race distances to keep up with male competitors,” according to the study. The same conclusion has been reached in studies examining running competitions, although the gender gap decreases with increasing age but not necessarily with increasing event length. A June 2019 study examined the physical attributes allowing women to do better at longer distances or in colder environments. “Men have shown to have better values of physiological performance determinants, such as higher VO2max, lower external load at anaerobic threshold, and better running economy,” researchers wrote. “However, women normally accumulate more body fat and also have an increased efficiency to produce energy through oxidation of this substrate during endurance performance, which could be an advantage in events with a longer length. “Furthermore, the natural decline in sex-specific hormones in men while aging may affect their performance, possibly leading to the recently observed sex difference reduction as athletes age,” researchers wrote. Nonetheless, the physical differences at what most sports consider “peak” athletic age remain. “Sex differences between the world’s best athletes in most events have remained relatively stable at approximately 8 to 12 percent,” Øyvind Sandbakk, Ph.D., managing director of the Centre for Elite Sports Research at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, told Healthline in 2017. Many women also face sociopolitical barriers that affect their opportunities to train and participate in elite-level sports. “In many countries, there are cultural restrictions, religious restrictions, and organizational restrictions,” Laura Capranica, MSc, a professor of sports sciences at the Foro Italico University of Rome, told Healthline. “So you will not have the same athletic base from which you can have the best, the most talented women proceeding through sports careers,” she said. Girls and women continue to receive fewer opportunities and less economic and social support in the world of sports. But those social conditions are improving, some say, and may also help close the performance gap. “What motivates girls and women to engage is changing over time, and the factors that influence involvement have individual, cultural, and social origins, as well as a number of other consequences,” Jake Dickson, a certified personal trainer and Barbend magazine contributing editor, told Healthline. “Although, I think there are many ways in which program designers and providers along with government support can encourage girls and women to participate in sports and physical activity programs,” he said.

Sex-related hormones can also influence performance gaps between genders. Some women with intersex conditions and other differences in sex development have unusually high levels of testosterone. But on average, women tend to have lower levels of circulating testosterone than men. This likely contributes to lower average muscle mass and cardiovascular capacity among women, which in turn affects their athletic performance. Transgender athletes are also being recognized earlier and have options to transition earlier, which affects physical development. “A transgender man who went through a female puberty should be unable to beat a cisgender man because he would lack the structural characteristics of someone who has gone through a male puberty such as broader shoulders, bigger hands, greater cardiovascular capacity, more muscle mass, etc.,” Robert Herbst, a 19-time world champion powerlifter and a member of the New York State Bar Association Task Force on Transgender Youth in Sports, told Healthline. “A transgender man who transitioned earlier would be closer depending on the hormone therapy, especially the amount of testosterone and human growth hormone he received, although he may still lack other attributes such as competitiveness or mental toughness, which are drilled into boys as they are raised in sports,” Herbst said. He said the good news is that early training for girls is becoming more common. “Non-trans women are getting closer to men because more girls are being exposed to sports such as in youth leagues, private instruction, and travel teams at an earlier age,” Herbst said. “This increases the pool of potential athletes and also gives more girls an athletic background similar to that of boys.” “Also, more girls and teens are following harder and more sophisticated training regimens similar to that of males such as weight training and nutrition,” he added. “Girls are being encouraged to be competitive, so they are not being limited by societal concerns of not being feminine. This results in more female athletes coming closer to realizing their genetic potential, which brings them closer to men’s performances.”

Given the average differences in physiology and opportunities, some experts question the usefulness of comparing the sports performance of men and women. On the one hand, it’s possible to acknowledge differences in biology without devaluing the efforts and achievements of women athletes. “Part of the reason that we divide a lot of sports by gender is because the ability level is, just on average, fundamentally different between men and women. It’s not that different in some ways than when we segregate wrestling by weight class,” Alice Dreger, Ph.D., a sex researcher and historian of medicine and science, told Healthline. “I don’t know why that has to be seen as an antifeminist claim,” she said. “There are lots of ways to support women in sports, while not denying the reality of hormones mattering, and height mattering, and oxygen processing mattering, and all that kind of stuff.” On the other hand, overly simplistic comparisons may contribute to inequitable attitudes about women and distract from more useful conversations. “Why are people interested in comparing women and men? It often has a sort of discriminatory philosophy underneath,” Capranica argued. “I would stop doing that kind of comparison, which is quite useless. Instead, I would focus on social opportunities for sport,” she continued. “I want women to have our own opportunities to play, to compete, and to use sport as a springboard, as a social and personal tool for empowerment,” Capranica said. “How can we bridge the gaps in opportunity? In my opinion, that should be the question we focus on.” This story was updated by Tony Hicks on March 16, 2022.",0

790,"July 14, 2022 – Rising demand for the monkeypox vaccine in New York City has caused the city’s appointment system to crash.

Monkeypox-related supplies have been running out as soon as they arrive, according to The Associated Press. City health officials acknowledged the frustration about the limited supply and promised to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as vaccine supply increases “in the coming weeks.”

“Due to overwhelming traffic, as soon as appointments went online this afternoon, the site delivered error messages for many people who were unable to make appointments,” Ashwin Vasan, MD, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in a statement on Tuesday.

“This is just further proof that demand is very high, and we will continue working to make vaccine available,” he said. “We will advise New Yorkers when more appointments can be made.”

As of July 13, 336 people in New York City had tested positive for orthopoxvirus, and all cases are likely monkeypox, the department said in a news update. There are likely more cases that haven’t been diagnosed.",0

• Studies have shown that around one-third of people with mental health conditions like depression don’t respond to psychedelic treatments.
• Scientists aren’t entirely sure why people respond to psychedelics differently, but new research suggests that genetic variations in a serotonin receptor may be a factor.
• While genetics can play a role in many mental health conditions, some experts say that DNA is unlikely to be the sole contributing factor to how a person responds to psychedelic drugs.
• Just as symptoms associated with various mental health conditions may present differently in different people, how people respond to psychedelics may also vary. Many people with depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) benefit from psychedelic drug treatments, clinical trials show. Psychedelic drugs affect thinking, emotion, and perception by binding to and in the brain. A 2021 study found that psilocybin, or “magic mushrooms,” was similarly effective for treating depression as the antidepressant escitalopram (Lexapro). While the results of some trials have been promising, not everyone responds to psychedelic treatments (which is also true for antidepressants). Scientists are not yet certain why psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline don’t produce similar effects for everyone, but one possibility is that genetics may play a role. A new study, published July 27 in ACS Chemical Neuroscience, examined the effect that different gene variants for serotonin receptor 5-HT2A have on how psychedelics bind to this receptor, noting moderate effects.

In the new study, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill expanded on existing research exploring the role of serotonin receptor 5-HT2A in non-psychedelic drug responses. UNC researchers focused on seven variants caused by a change in a single DNA building block in the receptor gene, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs occur in 0.003% to 7.9% of people, the authors wrote in the paper. Working with human cells in a lab, researchers ran tests to see how different psychedelics — psilocin, mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT, and LSD — bound to these receptor variants. (Psilocin is the psychedelically active compound found in psilocybin mushrooms.) The tests showed the receptor variants produced “statistically significant, although modest, effects” on the potency of these four psychedelics, the researchers said — at least in the lab. The effects were also dependent upon the specific drug and receptor variant combinations. “Genetic variation in this receptor has been shown to influence the response of patients to other drugs,” Dustin Hines, PhD, an assistant professor of neuroscience in the department of psychology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the new study, told Healthline. “While psychedelic therapies can provide rapid and sustained therapeutic benefits for multiple mental health concerns, there are a proportion of patients who fail to respond.” According to Hines, genetic variations in this serotonin receptor may contribute to why psychedelic therapy may not work for everyone. He said two prior studies in and 2021 found that around one-third of people with depression didn’t respond to psilocybin treatment. An even smaller number of people experienced some kind of negative side effect to psychedelic treatments in general. The UNC researchers concluded that future clinical trials may need to take into account the influence that genetics might play on how people respond to psychedelic treatments.

While genetics can play a role in many mental health conditions, a person’s DNA is unlikely to be the sole factor influencing how people respond to psychedelic treatments for depression, anxiety, or PTSD. But Rachel Yehuda, PhD, professor of psychiatry and neuroscience of trauma at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said that genetics could play a small role in people’s varied responses. “We already know the kinds of factors that might determine response [to psychedelic treatments],” she said. According to Hines, how a person responds to psychedelic treatment may also include their capacity for engaging in psychotherapy, their ability to be compassionate toward themselves, as well as how severe their trauma is and how early in their life it started. Of course, these factors can affect any mental health treatment, not just psychedelic treatments. However, Yehuda noted one factor that’s specific to psychedelic treatments is how easily a person submits to the effects of a drug that alters their consciousness. “There is a very active way that you can resist the [psychedelic] effect, and say, ‘I’m not doing this,'” she said. Hines added that variability in mental health conditions from person to person could also contribute to how well people respond to treatments — psychedelic or otherwise. “Some individuals with depression may have a genetic predisposition that increases the likelihood that they will experience depression in their lives,” Hines said. “Other individuals facing depression may have more situational or environmental contributions.” Hines noted that a person living with a mental health condition such as anxiety could potentially complicate the effectiveness of the treatment.

Some have a strong response to psychedelics Yehuda said that one of the challenges of determining how people benefit from a psychedelic treatment is defining what a “response” is. For instance, it could mean that after treatment, a person no longer has the condition they were being treated for, whether it’s PTSD, anxiety, or depression. But another way to view a positive response to treatment is by noting improvements in their symptoms — maybe they’re not 100% better or “cured,” but are headed in that direction. While most people would hope for a full recovery, even small improvements in symptoms can transform a person’s life. For some people, partial recovery might mean being able to go to a concert with a loved one. For others, it could mean feeling comfortable in a crowd or talking with a stranger at a party. “These little behaviors make up a life,” Yehuda said. “If you can start living your life again, rejoining your family in a different kind of way, and feeling like you could take more chances and be part of the world, that’s a really good thing.” Based on the current research, however, many people do fall into that first category of having a dramatic response to psychedelics. “One of the things that has been impressive in the psychedelic studies is that there’s quite a large proportion of people that, by the study’s end, don’t have the condition that they had at the start,” Yehuda said. “Certainly it’s true with PTSD — there are a lot of people that flipped from having PTSD to not having PTSD, which is quite remarkable in terms of a level of response.”

Researchers like Yehuda get very excited about the large number of people who have had a clinically significant response to psychedelic treatments for mental health conditions. And even with a proportion of people not responding, psychedelic treatments can still be valuable. “We need to bear in mind that patients in many of the clinical trials to date are treatment-resistant and have struggled in some cases for many years before receiving psychedelic therapy,” Hines said. Yehuda expects that as the psychedelic research field matures, clinical trials will have to be adapted to fit the reality of patient responses. “A lot of [scientists] are interested in doing trials with psychedelics,” she said. “And hopefully these people know there is a need to consider the possibility — or to entertain the probability — that there’s going to be response variation.”",0
792,"New research suggests that stretching and balancing exercises may also be able to help slow the speed of mild cognitive decline. Sergey Narevskih/Stocksy
• New data suggests regular stretching, balance, and range-of-motion exercises may be as beneficial as aerobic exercises in slowing down mild cognitive decline.
• Researchers say the new data makes using physical activity to slow mild cognitive decline more accessible.
• Other experts say these types of movements have other physical health benefits. Simple movement, including regular stretching, balance, and range of motion exercises, might be just as effective in slowing mild cognitive decline as aerobic exercises. It may sound like a stretch, but new research suggests it’s science. Researchers presented the data at the 2022 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in San Diego on Aug. 2. To perform the study, they followed 296 sedentary older adults already diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This condition can lead to Alzheimer’s Disease, though it’s not a given. Half of the participants were instructed to do aerobic exercises on treadmills and stationary bikes at a moderate intensity of about 120 heartbeats per minute for 30 to 40 minutes. The rest were told to perform functional stretching, balance, and range of motion exercises. The groups worked with a personal trainer twice per week and alone on two additional days for a year. At the end of the year, researchers performed cognitive testing and brain scans. Neither group’s cognitive decline got worse, nor did scans indicate brain shrinkage had occurred. Previously, that aerobic exercise could help executive function, attentional capacity, processing speed, episodic memory, and procedural memory. But some older adults may have issues gaining physical activity. Lead researcher Laura Baker, a neuroscientist at Wake Forest School of Medicine, said the new study’s results suggest “this is doable for everybody,” and not just older adults able to perform moderate-intensity exercises, according to an AP report.

Some caution is needed in interpreting the results There are a few limitations to the study. First, previous research has indicated that people who do not exercise at all have experienced significant cognitive decline. According to the AP, the National Insitute of Aging said that looking at non-exercisers in the same study could have offered better proof of the findings. And one personal trainer cautions that the study does not show that stretching alone slows MCI because other types of gentle movement, such as balance exercises, were included. “Typically, stretching is the control group in an exercise and brain health study, and this study could have incorporated a third group, which is an active control that only does stretching, to further elucidate what may be happening here,” Ryan Glatt, CPT, NBC-HWC, a California-based personal trainer and brain health coach for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. Still, there are takeaways from the study. Experts shed light on what people can learn from the study and how to incorporate gentle movement into their lifestyle.

Why gentle movement is important in older adults Jordan Glenn, PhD, the senior vice president of clinical development at Neurotrack, says that there are several risk factors associated with MCI and the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease that stretching may help alleviate, including:
• poor blood flow and circulation as potential risk factors for developing vascular dementia Though stretching may not elevate the heart rate, it does require a person to use their brains. “Stretching and range of motion exercises force you to focus on your body and to create mind-muscle connections to achieve proper form,” says Nancy Mitchell, RN, who has worked with older patients for nearly four decades. “If you’ve ever taken a yoga class, you’d understand the mental energy it takes to get into pigeon pose.” Mitchell says the amount of concentration involved in stretching and balance-related activities may stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for thinking and memory, thereby slowing cognitive decline. Some experts stress that stretching, balance, and range of motion exercises are also important for physical health and day-to-day functioning, particularly as people get older. Sean Kinsman, PT, DPT, the chief clinical officer at RecoveryOne, notes stretching can help with:

Top tips on getting a gentle move on The participants in the study performed stretches, range of motion, and balance exercises four times per week. Kinsman says daily stretching is ideal. Another personal trainer agrees but says a routine similar to that of the study participants is also beneficial. But remaining consistent is important. “When you stretch a muscle, it stretches out, but then it shortens again over time,” says David Candy, PT, DPT, OCS, ATC, CMTPT, FAAOMPT, the owner of More 4 Life. Kinsman says it’s important to consider two key components of soft tissue when incorporating gentle movement, particularly stretches, into your routine: elastic and plastic range. “With the elastic range, the stretch is performed, but there is no lasting change to the muscle or tendon length, and it simply rebounds to its normal pliability/length capacity, much like an elastic,” Kinsman says. “The plastic range is pushing beyond the elastic range to make permanent changes to the length and pliability of the tissue,” What does this mean for people when stretching? “Stretching into the elastic range can be helpful for warming up and promoting looseness in the joints,” Kinsman says. “Stretching into the plastic range can impact those areas as well as promote better posture, break up muscle tension, prevent injury, reduce inflammation, and foster healing.” Holding a stretch for more than 90 seconds can allow a person to reach the plastic range of stretching the tissue. But he says it doesn’t have to be done all at once. “[It can] also can be broken up, most commonly three reps of 30-second holds,” Kinsman says. Candy stresses it’s important to never take a move to the point of discomfort. Glatt recommends working with a personal trainer or physical therapist that can create a personalized plan based on your needs, goals, and abilities.",0
793,"NIH study in mice explains how brain can turn pain signals up or down

A new study in mice uncovered a previously unknown role that the central amygdala can play in upgrading or downgrading pain signals in the brain’s circuitry. The study, published in Cell Reports, was conducted by researchers at the Division of Intramural Research at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“We know that pain is not static and that it can be modulated by several factors. Early research showed that the central amygdala, long known for its role in processing fear, can dial up pain signals. Yet, other studies have pointed to the central amygdala’s role in suppressing pain, or prompting an analgesic response,” said Yarimar Carrasquillo, Ph.D., senior author of the study and lead scientist for the Behavioral Neurocircuitry and Cellular Plasticity Section in the NCCIH Intramural Division. “This study unravels what seemed to be a contradiction in early research and reveals a previously hidden ‘switch’ in the central amygdala that can turn up or turn down pain signals.”

The “switch” acts more like a “pain rheostat,” similar to a home thermostat that modulates temperature — the pain rheostat reacts to pain signals to modulate pain sensations. In the mice, researchers found that activity in neurons that express protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ) turned up the pain rheostat and demonstrated an increase in pain-related responses. Conversely, researchers found that activity in neurons that express somatostatin (CeA-Som) turned down the pain rheostat, inhibiting nociception or the chain of activity in the nerves required to communicate pain.

During the experiments, researchers were able to take advantage of molecular genetic approaches that allow them to fluorescently label and manipulate the activity of these two central amygdala cell types. They found that when they blocked CeA-PKCδ neurons, pain activity decreased. When researchers activated CeA-Som neurons, they observed a marked analgesic response in mice.

“This new understanding of the amygdala’s dual role, and the pathways that can promote the perception of pain or prompt an analgesic response, is critical to understanding how pain manifests,” said Helene Langevin, M.D., NCCIH director. “It also provides new clues for researchers to pursue in learning how we might manage pain by modulating what’s happening in the brain.”

While pain perception is essential for survival, it can be amplified or suppressed by factors like expectations, past experiences, and context. The research team led by Dr. Carrasquillo conducts basic science research into anatomical, molecular, and cellular mechanisms to better understand the mechanisms of pain modulation in the brain.

The study is part of NCCIH’s broad range of intramural and extramural efforts to address the issue of pain and chronic pain in the United States, including NCCIH’s role in the NIH-wide HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM) Initiative and the NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory. Approximately 40% of NCCIH’s overall budget focuses on pain.

Pain is the most common reason patients in the U.S. seek medical care and one of the most common reasons people turn to complementary health approaches. The 2012 National Health Interview Survey showed that about 11% of U.S. adults have pain every day and more than 17% have severe levels of pain.

794,"Sept. 26, 2022 – Albert Bourla, CEO of COVID-19 vaccine maker Pfizer, has tested positive for the coronavirus but is showing no symptoms, he said over the weekend.

“I have tested positive for COVID. I’m feeling well & symptom free. I’ve not had the new bivalent booster yet, as I was following CDC guidelines to wait 3 months since my previous COVID case which was back in mid-August. While we’ve made great progress, the virus is still with us,” he said on Twitter on Saturday.

Bourla has received four rounds of the Pfizer vaccine. He first tested positive for COVID on Aug. 15, Reuters reported. At the time, Bourla, 60, said he was isolating and had started a course of the company's oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid.

795,"A novel computational platform developed by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine identifies top-performing viral vectors that could deliver gene therapies to the retina with maximum efficiency and precision.

The technology, described in a paper published today in the journal eLife, streamlines development of gene therapy approaches for the treatment of genetic blinding disorders. The approach saves precious time and resources by speeding up identification of suitable gene-carrying candidates able to deliver therapy to an affected part of the retina with astounding accuracy.

""Vision loss has a huge impact on quality of life. It has long been near the top of the greatest fears of people, alongside cancer and Alzheimer's disease,"" said senior author Leah Byrne, Ph.D., assistant professor of ophthalmology at Pitt. ""But the field of vision restoration has entered a new era, where many patients have received effective treatment for the very first time. Because of that, the potential of our new platform is thrilling -- it will allow us to translate emergent therapies that are already working for some patients into the clinic much more rapidly.""

Even though blinding genetic disorders that affect the retina are considered rare, approximately 1 in every 3,000 people worldwide carries one or more copies of broken genes that cause retinal degeneration and loss of vision. For centuries, many people with inherited blindness were all but guaranteed to spend a portion of their lives in darkness.

Now, with several gene therapies already on the market in Europe and the U.S., and dozens more entering clinical trials, hope for people with inherited blindness is within reach, but a key obstacle remains: ensuring that vectors, or inactivated viruses carrying the therapeutic genetic code, enter the exact cells that scientists are targeting. The retina is composed of hundreds of millions of cells that are arranged into a series of layers, so precisely targeting the vector to a specific location within that universe is not a trivial task.

To approach the problem, researchers developed a computational platform called scAAVengr, which uses single-cell RNA sequencing to quickly and quantitatively evaluate -- among dozens of options -- which adeno-associated virus vector, or AAV, is best suited for the task of delivering a gene therapy to a specific part of the retina.

The traditional approach of evaluating AAVs is painstakingly slow, requiring several years and many experimental animals. It is also not very precise, since it doesn't directly measure if AAVs not only entered the cells but also delivered their gene therapy cargo.

In contrast, scAAVengr uses single-cell RNA sequencing, which detects if the cargo arrives at its destination safely. And with scAAVengr, that process takes months, not years.

The platform's uses aren't just limited to the retina -- the researchers showed that it works just as well for the identification of AAVs that target other tissues, including the brain, heart and liver.

""A rising tide lifts all boats, and we hope that this technology propels gene therapy treatments not just in the field of vision restoration but for other purposes,"" said Byrne. ""Rapidly developing fields of gene editing and optogenetics all rely on efficient gene delivery, so the ability to quickly and strategically choose the delivery vectors would be an exciting leap forward.""

However, such a model could be vital for testing drugs and toxins in a lab. Unlike stem cells, mature cells cannot differentiate into other kinds of cells. Although heart tissue grown in a lab that behaves like native heart tissue is rare, it would be an essential step in developing human tissue models for testing drugs. Researchers at Columbia University are interested in tissue that mimics adult cardiac muscle, and manipulation of the early-stage iPS-CMs and regular electromechanical stimuli can achieve that result. Shorter wait times appeared to produce cells that were more responsive to stimuli, so the researchers increased electrical stimulation each day. Though not a significant stride, researchers did successfully produce adult-like gene expression and organized ultrastructure, as well as a number of functional features. Successfully developing reliable human tissue models for drug testing could make developing safe and effective drugs quicker, less expensive, and safer.

803,"Deciding when to start or grow a family is deeply personal and complex. When someone begins using a contraceptive, it may seem obvious they are not planning to get pregnant anytime soon. But a study recently published in PLOS ONE found that pregnancy intentions often change over as short as a 12-month time period, and that they specifically vary with partner status, household income, and employment status.

""When we think about whether or when people would like become pregnant, people often assume that there is one big life plan,"" said Claudia Geist, associate professor and associate Dean for Research in the University of Utah's School for Cultural and Social Transformation and lead author of the study. ""However, we know that things shift across the lifespan.""

While some studies have identified potential factors that influence pregnancy decisions, few studies have assessed how these decisions may change or shift over time and which personal circumstances are associated with the change. This study aimed to support providers in being more flexible and responsive to contraceptive clients' needs. Understanding how much pregnancy intentions can change in just one year adds to ongoing efforts to de-stigmatize and support the common practices of switching and ending various contraceptive methods.

The researchers followed a cohort of people who participated in the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative, a prospective study that recruited participants from four family planning clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah between September 2015, and March 2017. Eligible participants were between ages 18 and 45 and either initiating a new contraceptive or switching to a different contraceptive method. In addition, they needed to be intending to prevent pregnancy for at least one year.

The analysis includes 2,825 participants who provided pregnancy intention data at both the time of enrollment and the 12-month follow-up. Participants were asked to respond to the question, ""What are your future pregnancy plans?"" Response options included:
• ""I am currently trying to get pregnant"" (only available at 12-month follow-up)
• ""I would like to get pregnant in the next year""
• ""I would like to get pregnant in the next 2-5 years, but not in the next year""
• ""I would like to get pregnant in the next 5-10 years, but not before then""
• ""I am uncertain if or when I would like to become pregnant"" (only available at enrollment)
• I do not plan on getting pregnant at any time in the future

At the 12-month follow up, the majority (79%) of participants maintained their pregnancy timing intention, while just under 20% reported a change. Among those who initially said they never wanted a pregnancy, 22% changed their mind over the course of a year. About 10% of participants shifted their pregnancy timing to desire a pregnancy earlier than at the time of enrollment.

""I expected change, but I didn't expect as much change as we found,"" said Geist. ""We found that economic stability, including more household income and/or full-time employment, seems to put people in a frame of mind where they consider a pregnancy after previously stating to never want a pregnancy.""

In addition to economic stability, researchers considered relationship status, sexual identity and educational status and aspiration. Exploring the associations between changes in personal circumstances and shifts in pregnancy intentions, researchers hope to offer insight to clinicians who provide contraception.

""The rapid changes we found over 12 months are a stark reminder that health care providers need to check in frequently about the pregnancy desires of their patients,"" said Geist.",0

There is therefore a great need for new solutions to tackle resistant bacteria and reduce the use of antibiotics. A group of researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden are now presenting a new spray that can kill even antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and that can be used for wound care and directly on implants and other medical devices.

""Our innovation can have a dual impact in the fight against antibiotic resistance. The material has been shown to be effective against many different types of bacteria, including those that are resistant to antibiotics, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), while also having the potential to prevent infections and thus reduce the need for antibiotics,"" says Martin Andersson, head of research for the study and professor at the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Chalmers.

It is already estimated that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause nearly 1.3 million deaths a year worldwide. As part of the effort to slow down the spread and development of drug resistance, researchers at Chalmers are developing a new antibacterial material that can be used in healthcare and become an effective tool to fight antibioitic resistance.

The material consists of small hydrogel particles equipped with a type of peptide* that effectively kills and binds bacteria. Attaching the peptides to the particles provides a protective environment and increases the stability of the peptides. This allows them to work together with body fluids such as blood, which otherwise inactivates the peptides, making them difficult to use in healthcare. In previous studies, the researchers showed how the peptides can be used for wound care materials such as wound dressings. They have now published two new studies in which the bactericidal material is used in the form of a wound spray and as a coating on medical devices that are introduced into our bodies. This new step in the research means that the innovation can be used in more ways and be of even greater benefit in healthcare.

The wound spray, which can reach into deep wounds and other open areas on the body where bacteria can enter, is flexible and very useful for treating and preventing infection. The new material has many advantages over existing sprays and disinfectants

""The substance in this wound spray is completely non-toxic and does not affect human cells. Unlike existing bactericidal sprays, it does not inhibit the body's healing process. The materials, which are simply sprayed onto the wound, can also kill the bacteria in a shorter time,"" says Edvin Blomstrand, an industrial doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and one of the lead authors of the scientific article.

Reduces the risk of infection from materials introduced into the body

For treatments in which materials such as implants and catheters are inserted into our bodies, infections are a major problem. Therefore, there is great need for new antibacterial biomaterials, i.e. materials that treat, replace or modify organs, tissue or functions in a biological body. One of the major sources for hospital-acquired infection comes from the usage of urinary catheters. The Chalmers researchers' new coating can now be an effective new tool for reducing this risk and preventing infections.

""Although the catheters are sterile when unpacked, they can become contaminated with bacteria while they are being introduced into the body, which can lead to infection. One major advantage of this coating is that the bacteria are killed as soon as they come into contact with the surface. Another is that it can be applied to existing products that are already used in healthcare, so it is not necessary to produce new ones,"" says Annija Stepulane, a doctoral student at the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Chalmers and one of the lead authors of the article.

In the study, the researchers tested the coating on silicone materials used for catheters, but they see opportunities to use it on other biomaterials.

The research on the antibacterial materials is being conducted in collaboration with the spin-off company Amferia AB, which is also commercialising the technology. Chalmers and Amferia have previously presented the antibacterial material in the form of hydrogel wound dressings, which are presently under clinical investigation for both human and animal wound care.",0

810,"CHICAGO – Low-dose antioxidant supplementation may reduce the risk of cancer among men, but not in women, according to an article in the November 22 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.

According to the article, antioxidants including beta carotene, ascorbic acid, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc may prevent some of the harmful effects caused by free radicals – reactive molecules produced by metabolism in the body. It has also been suggested that a low dietary intake of antioxidants increases the incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Serge Hercberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) and Unite de Surveillance et d'Epidemiologie Nutritionnelle, Paris, and colleagues tested the efficacy of dietary supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in reducing the incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 13,017 French adults. There were 7,876 women aged 35 to 60 years old, and 5,141 men ages 45 to 60 years old included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to take either a daily capsule containing 120 milligrams of ascorbic acid, 30 milligrams of vitamin E, six milligrams of beta carotene, 100 micrograms of selenium, and 20 milligrams of zinc; or a placebo capsule. Participants were followed-up for a median of 7.5 years.

The researchers found no differences between the antioxidant and placebo group in terms of cancer incidence (4.1 percent of the antioxidant group vs. 4.5 percent of the placebo group), or in cardiovascular disease incidence (2.1 percent for the antioxidant group vs. 2.1 percent for the placebo group) or all-cause death (1.2 percent for the antioxidant group vs. 1.5 percent for the placebo group).

However, when the researchers looked at cancer incidence according to sex, they found a significant protective effect of the antioxidants in men, who were 31 percent less likely to develop cancer than women. A similar trend was seen in men for death rates.

""After 7.5 years, low-dose antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in men but not in women. Supplementation may be effective in men only because of their lower baseline status of certain antioxidants, especially of beta carotene,"" the researchers write.

The authors conclude: ""… our results suggest that an adequate and well-balanced supplementation of antioxidant nutrients, at doses that might be reached with a healthy diet that includes a high consumption of fruits and vegetables, had protective effects against cancer in men.""",0

 Liberals have been laughing it up over the death of radio icon Don Imus, because they can't for the life of them figure out how a ""backwards hillbilly sexist douchebag"" ever made it in New York radio. The answer is simple: Don Imus was everything real Americans love. 
 Sure, Don Imus lasted 10 years longer than his career, but that was because he was shunned by liberals for speaking the truth. Imus enshrined the values that make America great: Men are the superior gender in strength and bread-winning. The biggest problems facing our country are immigrants and the poor. People need to stop being helpless and start doing for themselves. And most importantly, we need to spend every last dime on the military if we're gonna continue to rule the free world. 
 Those are the things that true patriots believe, and Imus embodied them all. Now, after his passing, we're starting to learn just how amazing he truly was. Knowing his death was coming, Imus made some changes to his will that included removing his transgender daughter, who thinks she's now his son, and giving his (her?) share to the Trump 2020 campaign, which amounts to just about $2 million.

815,"Online calculator computes costs of testing and offers strategies for preventing infections in schools and businesses.

It can be an enormous challenge for schools and businesses to determine how to establish an effective COVID-19 testing program, particularly with the multiple testing options now on the market. An innovative online tool funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health, helps organizations choose a COVID-19 testing strategy that will work best for their specific needs. The COVID-19 Testing Impact Calculator is a free resource that shows how different approaches to testing and other mitigation measures, such as mask use, can curb the spread of the virus in any organization. It is the first online tool in the nation to provide schools and businesses with clear guidance on risk-reducing behaviors and testing to help them stay open safely.

A team led by the Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation and Technology (CIMIT) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, and researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, developed the tool to model the costs and benefits of COVID-19 testing strategies for individual organizations. The team developed their mathematical model and calculator as part of NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) Tech program. The calculator is simple--a user enters a few specifics about their site and the tool produces customized scenarios for surveillance testing. The tool models four different COVID-19 testing methods, including onsite and lab-based, and calculates the number of people to test each day. It shows the estimated cost of each testing option and outlines the tradeoffs in the speed and accuracy of each kind of test.

“The NIH RADx initiative has enabled innovation and growth in the creation of new, rapid COVID-19 testing technologies,” said Bruce J. Tromberg, Ph.D., director of NIBIB and lead for the RADx Tech program. “Using this tool, school administrators and business owners can quickly evaluate the cost and performance of different tests to help find the best match for their unique organization.”

The COVID-19 Testing Impact Calculator also shows how other Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended countermeasures, such as masks, contact tracing and social distancing, can work in concert with testing to keep people safe. Users enter which of these measures are in place in their organization and the tool integrates this information to produce testing recommendations. By adjusting these entries, users get a startling demonstration of how implementing simple countermeasures can drastically reduce their testing costs. For example, for a site that allows mask-less activities such as meetings or dining, reducing the group size on the calculator from 12 to six cuts the cost of the recommended testing strategy by more than half. Thus, the tool can inform leaders about how implementing these practices in addition to testing can keep their school or business open safely and with less expense.

Co-developer of the tool, Anette (Peko) Hosoi, Ph.D., is associate dean of engineering and the Neil and Jane Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. She also is an affiliate of the university’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), where students and researchers combine cutting-edge data analysis with social science methodology to tackle pressing societal challenges like the coronavirus pandemic.

“A false dichotomy is often perpetuated that we must either stop COVID or reopen the economy,” said Hosoi. “But we know a lot now about how this disease spreads and the answer is not an either/or proposition. We know what kinds of measures are necessary to keep things running and mitigate the spread while operating — maybe not under normal conditions, but certainly under functional conditions.”

Co-developer Paul Tessier, Ph.D., is product development director at CIMIT, the RADx Tech coordinating center. “The calculator is a major enabler for test-technologies being developed, commercialized and deployed with help from the RADx Tech program,” Tessier said. He explained that implementing a testing program carries weighty considerations, including cost and number of testing instruments, arranging for test takers, and determining the optimal frequency for testing. “We are excited to join forces with MIT’s IDSS to advance a decision-making tool for operating safely.”

816,"July 23, 2022 -- President Biden’s COVID-19 symptoms are improving and he felt well enough on Friday to work more than eight hours, White House officials said. Biden has a raspy voice and a cough, but his temperature is back to normal and he hasn’t lost his appetite, the officials said, according to The Associated Press. “I feel much better than I sound,” Biden said during part of a video conference with economic advisors that reporters were allowed to watch. Later in the day he had separate discussions with legislative and national security advisors, The Associated Press said. “He’s still doing the job of the president,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “That does not end.” The 79-year-old president, who is fully vaccinated and twice boosted, tested positive for COVID on Thursday morning. He had a temperature of 99.4 F at one point but that was lowered with Tylenol, the presidential doctor, Kevin C. O’Connor, said in a public letter about Biden’s treatment plan.

Biden’s blood pressure, breathing, and other vital signs have been normal, O’Connor said. The President is now taking Paxlovid, a COVID antiviral pill, and has stopped taking two prescribed medications, Crestor and Eliquis, apparently to avoid a possible negative interaction. Biden will use an inhaler, Tylenol, and aspirin as needed, O’Connor said. White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha told reporters that Biden will isolate for five days at the White House and be retested. When he tests negative, he’ll return to in-person work. The White House under Biden is providing more information about the President that was released when former President Trump got COVID in 2020, before vaccines were available. Trump spent three nights in the hospital. However, reporters are not allowed to speak directly to Biden’s doctor, O’Connor, The Associated Press said. Jha and others are releasing information about Biden’s condition. So far, it’s not known if Biden was infected with the BA.5 variant that is currently responsible for most of the COVID cases in the United States. Genome sequencing will determine which strain he got, Jha said. Jean-Pierre said 17 people who had been in close contact with Biden recently have all tested negative for COVID, including First Lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.",0

820,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), sometimes referred to as a ""pacemaker for the brain,"" involves a stimulator device that is implanted under the skin in the chest, with a wire that is wound around the vagus nerve in the neck. It helps prevent seizures by sending regular, mild electrical pulses to the brain. Typically, the patient is not aware the device is operating.

A new study from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago published in the journal Epilepsiaexamined a population of pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. For these patients, the study found that the patients who received VNS, when used with anti-seizure medications (ASM), had lower hospital costs compared to the use of ASM alone. The study found that the patients treated with ASM plus VNS had savings of over $3,000 of epilepsy-related annual costs per year, compared to treatment with ASM only. These findings mirror the team's previous report of children with drug-resistant epilepsy having significantly decreased inpatient healthcare utilization following VNS plus ASM compared to those treated with ASM alone. The study on healthcare utilization was published in Epilepsy & Behavior.

""We take a health services research perspective on the patients' journey with a challenging disease process of drug-resistant epilepsy that has not been met with a cure. For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, reducing seizure burden and addressing quality of life are important goals. We quantify aspects of outcomes of surgical therapies and medical therapies, and we assess the impact on health care costs and utilization. To the patients, families, health care systems, health care advocates, and policymakers, these are important results,"" said senior author Sandi Lam, MD, MBA, Division Head of Neurosurgery at Lurie Children's and Professor of Neurological Surgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""While we show lower costs to the health care system following VNS surgery, from a practical standpoint it means fewer hospital admissions because of seizures. Patients spend their days at home instead of in the hospital.""

The study is unique in multiple ways. There has been no previous research focusing on children with drug-resistant epilepsy and comparing the outcomes of those who had VNS and ASMs and those who only received ASMs. The study also provides a breakdown of costs by site of care (inpatient, outpatient, and Emergency Department). The study researchers found that emergency department costs decreased more for children treated with VNS and ASM, compared to ASM alone. While average annual total costs were higher in the ASM-only cohort, the researchers also observed that outpatient care costs for VNS with ASM were higher than ASM alone. The study authors note that it is not surprising that children required more outpatient care shortly after VNS implantation, since device adjustment for each patient is necessary in this time period. Outpatient costs for children with VNS decreased dramatically in the second year. Future studies warrant additional focus on costs and patterns of care in longer term follow-up.

Research with national data do not substitute for clinical research. Each patient with epilepsy presents a unique case requiring tailored clinical care that should be managed at a comprehensive Level 4 NAEC pediatric epilepsy center like Lurie Children's. Large studies with health services research can inform future research as well as gaps and opportunities in health care delivery. The study shows that surgical options should be a part of the epilepsy treatment armamentarium. While future studies will look at cranial epilepsy surgery outcomes, this study was limited to VNS and did not include epilepsy surgery on the brain, which is an important way of epilepsy treatment.

The study included children (0-17 years of age) who were diagnosed with refractory epilepsy, with 1113 patients treated with ASM plus VNS and 3471 patients treated with ASM only. Data were sourced from the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, which contains inpatient, emergency department, ambulatory, and observation encounter level data from more than 44 children's hospitals in the United States. Patients in the study were followed one year prior and two years after meeting pre-determined criteria for refractory epilepsy.

823,"Scientists using an experimental treatment have slowed the progression of scrapie, a degenerative central nervous disease caused by prions, in laboratory mice and greatly extended the rodents’ lives, according to a new report in JCI Insight. The scientists used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), synthetic compounds that inhibit the formation of specific proteins.

Prion diseases occur when normally harmless prion protein molecules become abnormal and gather in clusters and filaments in the body, including the brain. The diseases are thought to be always fatal. Scrapie, which affects sheep and goats and can be adapted to rodents, is closely related to human prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is currently untreatable. Thus, scrapie is a valuable experimental model for the development of human prion disease therapies.

In the studies, National Institutes of Health scientists and their colleagues injected ASOs into the spinal fluid of mice already infected with scrapie or that were challenged with scrapie proteins within weeks of the injection. Ionis Pharmaceuticals specifically designed ASO1 and ASO2 to reduce the rodents’ supply of normal prion protein. Rodent studies using different dosages of ASO1 and ASO2 were conducted at Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana, (part of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and at the Broad Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

RML scientists injected either ASO1 or ASO2 into mice 14 days prior to infecting them with scrapie, and then seven or 15 weeks after infection. Mice treated with ASO1 did not show clinical signs of disease for a median 250 days, or 82% longer than untreated mice (137 days), and they lived 81% longer than untreated mice (259 days versus 143 days). Mice treated with ASO2 did not show clinical signs of disease for a median 272 days, or 99% longer than untreated mice (137 days), and they lived 98% longer than untreated mice (283 days versus 143 days). In the Broad Institute experiments, mice received either ASO1 or ASO2 2 weeks before infection with scrapie and then seven weeks after infection. Both ASOs delayed rodent weight loss. Mice treated with ASO1 and ASO2 both lived longer than untreated mice, by 61% (274 days versus 170 days) and 76% (300 days versus 170 days), respectively.

The RML group also tested the ASOs against established prion disease, treating mice 17 weeks after they were infected with scrapie – near the onset of clinical signs. Mice treated with ASO1 did not show signs of clinical disease for a median 189 days, or 33% longer than untreated mice (142 days). They also showed slower disease progression and lived 55% longer than untreated mice (244 days versus 157 days). ASO2 had no beneficial effect.

The researchers plan to expand their scrapie ASO studies to human prion diseases. Other researchers have seen promising initial results in humans with ASOs directed against Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), and Huntington’s disease.

824,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0
825,"Oct. 4, 2022 -- The monkeypox virus is unlikely to be eliminated from the U.S. in the near future and could spread indefinitely at a low level, according to a new technical brief from the CDC.

828,"NIH scientists find that breast cancer protection from pregnancy starts decades later

In general, women who have had children have a lower risk of breast cancer compared to women who have never given birth. However, new research has found that moms don’t experience this breast cancer protection until many years later and may face elevated risk for more than 20 years after their last pregnancy.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health, along with members of the international Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group, found breast cancer risk increases in the years after a birth, with the highest risk of developing the disease about five years later. The findings, which appeared online in the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggest breast cancer protection from pregnancy may not begin until as many as 30 years after the birth of the last child.

According to senior author Dale Sandler, Ph.D., head of the Epidemiology Branch at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, a few prior studies reported an increase in breast cancer risk after childbirth. However, most of what researchers knew about breast cancer risk factors came from studies of women who have gone through menopause. Since breast cancer is relatively uncommon in younger women, it is more difficult to study.

Researchers combined data from approximately 890,000 women from 15 long-term studies across three continents, to understand the relationship between recent childbirth and breast cancer risk in women age 55 and younger.

""We were surprised to find that an increase in breast cancer risk lasted for an average of 24 years before childbirth became protective,"" said Sandler. ""Before this study, most researchers believed that any increase in risk lasted less than 10 years.""

The scientists also found that the association between recent childbirth and breast cancer risk was stronger for women who were older at first birth, had more births, or had a family history of breast cancer. Breastfeeding did not appear to have any protective effect, even though it is generally thought to reduce breast cancer risk. Many of these additional factors were not addressed in earlier studies, underscoring the statistical power of this larger project.

Sandler and first author Hazel Nichols, Ph.D., of the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, started the study when Nichols was a research fellow at NIEHS. Nichols explained that childbirth is an example of a risk factor that is different for younger women than older women.

""This difference is important because it suggests that we may need to develop tools for predicting breast cancer risk that are specific to young women,"" Nichols said. ""Doing so would help women talk to their health care providers about when they should start mammography screening.""

Nichols and Sandler both stressed the importance of keeping these findings in perspective. Breast cancer is uncommon in young women. An increase in the relative risk of breast cancer in women under age 55 translates to a very small number of additional cases of breast cancer per year.

Anthony Swerdlow, D.M., D.Sc., Ph.D., and Minouk Schoemaker, Ph.D., scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, co-led the study with Sandler and Nichols.

831,"PHOENIX, Ariz. — Headache disorders are among the most common health problems worldwide and one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In this expert alert, neurologist Amaal Starling, M.D., a headache and migraine expert at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, offers tips to prevent and manage headache disorders, including migraine and medication-induced rebound headache.

There are more than a dozen different types of headache disorders. The most common disabling headache disorder is migraine. It affects more than 1 billion people around the globe, including 1 in 5 women, 1 in 11 children and 1 in 16 men, and according to WHO, is one of the world’s most disabling diseases, Dr. Starling says.

Migraine disease can differ depending on a person’s stage in life, she says.

“Infant colic is thought to be the infant variant of migraine. Abdominal migraine and cyclic vomiting syndrome are migraine variants that are common in children,” Dr. Starling says. “More classic migraine attacks occur throughout adulthood. In the older adult, the pain associated with migraine lessens; however the associated features such as light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, or aura may be more prominent.”

Despite advances in treatment and prevention options, migraine remains underdiagnosed and therefore undertreated, Dr. Starling says. If someone has head pain that makes it difficult to function, odds are that it is migraine; often people think they have sinus headache when it is really migraine, she says.

Migraine is a primary headache disorder, meaning it is caused by abnormal function in the brain. Unlike secondary headache disorders, it may not be a symptom of an underlying illness such as an infection or a tumor.

Other common primary headache disorders include cluster headache, which occurs in bouts of attacks lasting from weeks to months and typically includes intense pain lasting up to three hours in or around one eye; and tension headache, which usually comes with mild to moderate pain and can be chronic.

Some primary headache disorders are associated with certain activities, such as cough headache, sex headache and exercise headache. They also can be triggered by drinking alcohol, eating certain foods such as processed meats containing nitrates, lack of sleep, poor posture, stress and missed meals.

“Migraine triggers are very individualized. A trigger for one patient may not be a trigger for the next patient,” Dr. Starling says.

“In general, I recommend eating an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean-style diet with fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes; eating foods high in magnesium, eating whole foods, and avoiding processed foods and fasting,” she says. “More recently there has been some data that recommend consuming more omega-3 fatty acids by eating fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel.”

Overuse of pain medication, including taking nonprescription analgesics such as aspirin and acetaminophen or prescription medications such as opioids and some migraine medications more than twice a week, can trigger rebound headache, also known as medication overuse headache.

“If someone is having migraine attacks four or more times a month, it is time to consider preventive treatment,” Dr. Starling says. “If someone has infrequent migraine attacks, occurring less than four times per month, a migraine-specific treatment as needed may be more effective than over-the-counter analgesic medications such as ibuprofen.”

New treatments for migraine include the discovery of a new family of preventive medications that target one of the body’s systems believed to be a culprit, the calcitonin gene-related peptide system, and the development of medical devices to treat migraine, she says.

If patients have head pain that is reducing their ability to function, rather than diagnosing themselves and self-medicating, it is best to see a health care provider for help managing symptoms, Dr. Starling says.

“Over the past several years there has been an explosion of treatment options for migraine attacks and migraine prevention,” she adds. “We have many treatment options to improve the lives of those living with migraine.”

The death rate between the two groups proved to be essentially the same, but those in the invasive strategy had fewer events in the last two years of the study. The caveat was that patients in the conservative strategy had fewer cardiovascular events during the first two years of the study. There was no impact on quality of life from the study. However, for patients with angina, the benefits of invasive procedures were consistent throughout the trial, and medication and lifestyle changes should not be used to treat angina. The studies should change clinical guidelines and influence clinical practice, but patients should confer with their doctors about the best strategy for them.

In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called Event 201 with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.

836,"Studies find that microbiome changes may be a signature for ME/CFS

Researchers have found differences in the gut microbiomes of people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) compared to healthy controls. Findings from two studies, published in Cell Host & Microbe and funded by the National Institutes of Health add to growing evidence that connects disruptions in the gut microbiome, the complete collection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in our gastrointestinal system, to ME/CFS.

“The microbiome has emerged as a potential contributor to ME/CFS. These findings provide unique insights into the role the microbiome plays in the disease and suggest that certain differences in gut microbes could serve as biomarkers for ME/CFS,” said Vicky Whittemore, Ph.D., program director at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

ME/CFS is a serious, chronic, and debilitating disease characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, sleep disturbance, cognitive difficulties, pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The causes of the disease are unknown and there are no treatments.

In one study, senior author Brent L. Williams, Ph.D., assistant professor, W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., John Snow Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in New York City, and their collaborators analyzed the genetic makeup of gut bacteria in fecal samples collected from a geographically diverse cohort of 106 people with ME/CFS and 91 healthy controls. The results revealed key differences in microbiome diversity, quantity, metabolic pathways, and interactions between species of gut bacteria.

Dr. Williams and his colleagues found that people with ME/CFS had abnormally low levels of several bacterial species compared to healthy controls, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) and Eubacterium rectale. These health-promoting bacteria produce a short chain fatty acid called butyrate, a bacterial metabolite, or by-product, that plays an important role in maintaining gut health. An acetate-producing bacterium was also reduced in samples obtained from people with ME/CFS.

More detailed metabolomic analyses confirmed that a reduction in these bacteria was associated with reduced butyrate production in ME/CFS. Butyrate is the primary energy source for cells that line the gut, providing up to 70% of their energy requirements, support for the gut immune system, and protection against diseases of the digestive tract. Butyrate, tryptophan, and other metabolites detected in the blood are important for regulating immune, metabolic, and endocrine functions.

While species of butyrate-producing bacteria decreased, there were increased levels of nine other species in ME/CFS, including Enterocloster bolteae and Ruminococcus gnavus, which are associated with autoimmune diseases and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively.

Dr. Williams’ group also reported that an abundance of F. prausnitzii was inversely associated with fatigue severity in ME/CFS, suggesting a possible link between gut bacteria and disease symptoms. More research is needed to determine if differences in the gut microbiome are a consequence or cause of symptoms.

The findings indicate that imbalances in these 12 species of bacteria could be used as biomarkers for ME/CFS classification, potentially providing consistent, measurable targets to improve diagnosis.

The gut microbiome is an ecosystem with complex interactions between bacteria, where microbes can exchange or compete for nutrients, metabolites, or other molecular signals. Researchers found notable differences in the network of species interactions in people with ME/CFS—including unique interactions between F. prausnitzii and other species. This indicates that there is an extensive rewiring of bacterial networks in ME/CFS.

“In addition to differences in individual species in ME/CFS, focusing a lens on community interaction dynamics may add greater specificity to the broad definition of dysbiosis, distinguishing between other diseases in which the gut microbiome becomes imbalanced,” said Dr. Williams. “This is also important for generating new testable hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms and mediators of dysbiosis in ME/CFS and may eventually inform strategies to correct these imbalances.”

A balanced microbiome is also essential for a variety of neural systems, especially immune regulation and coupling between energy metabolism and blood supply in the brain, as well as the function of the nerves that supply the gut.

In another study at the Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, Connecticut, Julia Oh, Ph.D., associate professor, and Derya Unutmaz, M.D., professor, teamed up with other ME/CFS experts to study microbiome abnormalities in different phases of ME/CFS. Dr. Oh’s team collected and analyzed clinical data, fecal samples, and blood samples from 149 people with ME/CFS who had been diagnosed within the previous four years (74 short-term) or who had been diagnosed more than 10 years ago (75 long-term) and 79 healthy controls.

The results showed that the short-term group had less microbial diversity, while the long-term group established a stable, but individualized gut microbiome similar to healthy controls. Dr. Oh and her colleagues found lower levels of several butyrate-producing species, including F. prausnitzii, especially in the short-term participants. There was also a reduction in species associated with tryptophan metabolism in all ME/CFS participants compared to controls.

Dr. Oh’s group also collected detailed clinical and lifestyle data from participants. By combining these data with genetic and metabolome data, the team developed a way to accurately classify and differentiate ME/CFS from healthy controls. Using this approach, they found that individuals with long-term ME/CFS had a more balanced microbiome but showed more severe clinical symptoms and progressive metabolic irregularities compared to the other groups.

Both studies identify potential biomarkers for ME/CFS, which may inform diagnostic tests and disease classification. Understanding the connection between disturbances in the gut microbiome and ME/CFS may also guide the development of new therapeutics.

Additional research is required to learn more about the pathophysiological implications of butyrate and other metabolite deficiencies in ME/CFS. Future studies will determine how gut microbe disturbances contribute to symptoms, including changes during disease progression.

The studies were funded in part by the NIH’s ME/CFS Collaborative Research Network, a consortium supported by multiple institutes and centers at NIH, consisting of three collaborative research centers and a data management coordinating center. The research network was established in 2017 to help advance research on ME/CFS. The research was supported by NINDS grant U54NS105539, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants U54AI138370 and R56AI120724, and anonymous donors through the Crowdfunding Microbe Discovery Project.

838,"New research indicates that belimumab, a monoclonal antibody therapy that targets a component of the immune system, provides considerable benefits to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a predominately female, chronic inflammatory disease that can affect virtually any organ. The Arthritis & Rheumatology findings are encouraging because lupus is among the leading causes of death in young women.

SLE is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disorder with a broad range of symptoms, and its development involves defective activation of B cells -- the immune cells charged with producing antibodies that attack invading bacteria, viruses, and toxins. B lymphocyte stimulator is a molecule involved in B cell differentiation, and elevated levels may contribute to the production of autoantibodies that target healthy cells and tissues.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of belimumab, which targets B lymphocyte stimulator, Andrea Doria, MD, of the University of Padova, in Italy, and colleagues conducted a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized SLE patients 2:1 to weekly subcutaneous injections of belimumab 200 mg or placebo, plus standard lupus therapy, for 52 weeks. Belimumab is currently given by intreavenous infusion, but the subcutaneous formulation of has recently become available.

In analyses of 356 patients with certain clinical characteristics indicative of high disease activity (hypocomplementemic and anti-dsDNA-positive), more patients in the belimumab group experienced reduced lupus disease activity, as measured by what is called the SLE responder index (64.6% versus 47.2%), and there was a lower incidence of severe SLE flares (14.1% versus 31.5%). Also, more people in the belimumab group were able to reduce their need for steroids. Side effects were similar between the groups.

""Intravenous administration of belimumab is an obstacle to treatment for many patients due to the need to go to the hospital for drug infusions. Thus, a higher number of patients could benefit from this treatment,"" said Dr. Doria. ""The self-administration of subcutaneous belimumab makes hospital access unnecessary, which leads to economic savings for patients and the community.""

An accompanying report in Arthritis & Rheumatology ranks lupus deaths among the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's leading causes-of-death to determine the relative burden of SLE deaths in women. (The agency compiles an annual leading-causes-of-death ranking based on a selected list of 113 causes, but SLE is not included on this list.) The report notes that during 2000-2015, there were 28,411 female deaths in the United States that had SLE recorded as the underlying or contributing cause of death. SLE ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the 15-24-year age group, 14th in 25-34-year and 35-44-year age groups, and 15th in 10-14-year age group. Among black and Hispanic females, SLE ranked 5th in the 15-24-year, 6th in the 25-34-year, and 8th-9th in the 35-44-year age groups, after excluding three common external injury causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) from the analysis.",0

A recent study of root canal longevity using electronic dental record data from 46,000 root canal patients treated in community dental practices found geographic and procedure disparities, providing real-world insight that can be used to inform dental practice.

Teeth survive about 11 years after a root canal, according to new research from Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University School of Dentistry. The groundbreaking study is the first to analyze records from community dental practices, where most Americans receive dental care.

""The findings of this study give deeper insight into the longevity of dental procedures because it provides real-world data on a wider range of patients, not just those receiving care in large health systems or those who are insured,"" said first author Thankam Thyvalikakath, DMD, MDS, PhD, director of the Regenstrief-IU School of Dentistry dental informatics program. ""This information can be used to inform dental practice, and help patients and dentists make better care decisions.""

Root canals are an important treatment to maintain natural teeth affected by disease. However, over time, the treated tooth eventually becomes brittle and dies. Understanding the outcomes of the procedure is essential to improving dental treatments.

For this study, the research team gathered deidentified electronic dental records from the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network, consisting of 99 small group and solo dentistry practices from around the country. The data covered more than 46,000 patients who received root canals.

Data analysis revealed that the median survival time of a tooth after a root canal is 11.1 years. However, several factors can impact that, including follow-up treatments.
• Teeth that receive a root canal, and a subsequent filling and crown last about 20 years.
• Teeth that receive either a filling or a crown after a root canal last around 11 years.
• Teeth that receive no restorative work after a root canal only last about 6.5 years.

There were also wide disparities in longevity among geographic regions.

""This data could also inform dental insurance coverage by demonstrating the value of crowns and permanent restoration options,"" said Dr. Thyvalikakath. ""Oral health is a public health issue that significantly affects people's overall health. Leveraging dental records can help us better understand ways to improve treatment, identify causal relationships and maintain the health of teeth and gums.""

This study provides more representative data of the overall population than previous studies. It also demonstrates that meaningful insights can be gained through analysis of existing data from routine dental care.

• Prolonged grief disorder was added to a key manual used by mental health experts that includes standards for assessing and diagnosing mental health conditions.
• The formal recognition of the disorder will help medical professionals be properly reimbursed for providing medical care.
• It will also help researchers secure funding to research the condition. Prolonged grief disorder is now officially recognized as a mental health condition by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The condition occurs when someone experiences extensive and intense feelings of grief after losing a loved one. In some cases, the grief can persist for more than 1 year and begin to cause disruptions to the person’s physical, mental, and spiritual health. Prolonged grief disorder was added to the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)”, a manual that includes standards for assessing and diagnosing mental health conditions. The formal recognition of the disorder will help medical professionals be properly reimbursed for providing medical care. It will also help researchers secure funding to research the condition. “Because many of us live in a diagnosis-centered society, the addition of prolonged grief will allow those who experience it to feel more validated in their emotions. It will help therapists and mental health professionals because insurance claims can be more easily verified around grief-related experiences,” said Kassondra Glenn, LMSW, a licensed psychotherapist and a consultant with Prosperity Haven Treatment Center.

Grief is a common, normal human emotion, and a natural reaction to loss. Grief affects everyone differently, said Christina Nolan, LSCW-R, a psychotherapist in New York City who specializes in working with adults experiencing depression, anxiety, and difficult life transitions. “It may be difficult to concentrate, perform normal activities, or sleep may be impaired. There may also be intense waves of different emotions, or feeling intensely overwhelmed,” she said. Grief typically resolves within 6 to 12 months, but some people may continue to experience the symptoms of grief and develop prolonged grief disorder. Over time, they may see a decline in physical, emotional, or spiritual health, said Nolan. According to the APA, symptoms of prolonged grief disorder include emotional numbness, intense emotional pain and loneliness, identity disruption, and disbelief about the person’s death. “Grief can completely derail functioning. It is not linear and often shows up in unexpected ways,” Glenn said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a tremendous toll with an estimated 970,000 people dead from COVID-19 in just the United States alone. A from 2021 estimated that 120,630 children in the United States lost a primary caregiver to COVID-19. That figure is now believed to be more than 200,000. Many people were unable to be with their loved ones when they died or were unable to attend their funeral services due to coronavirus restrictions. In addition, social isolation broke down people’s support networks and triggered feelings of loneliness. “These pandemic-related changes may have caused a person’s grieving process to be interrupted or prolonged,” says Nolan.

Expect more recognition and funding for grief disorders By adding prolonged grief disorder to the DSM-5, the APA has made it easier for doctors treating prolonged grief to be reimbursed for any care they provide related to it. “This would, in theory, allow people continuing to struggle with grief to receive treatment for it when otherwise they would not have been able to,” Nolan said. The addition to the DSM-5 is also expected to help researchers access funding to research the causes, risk factors, and treatment methods for prolonged grief disorder. Glenn thinks the addition could help people experiencing grief, an already complicated and unpredictable emotion, feel more validated in their emotions. “It will allow people to have more accurate language around their grief, and perhaps allow grief to become a more acceptable [and] integrated experience in society,” Glenn said.",0
849,"April 17, 2023 -- A new study published in Nature Medicine concludes that a surge in global type 2 diabetes cases was driven by three major dietary factors: insufficient intake of whole grains, excess consumption of refined rice and wheat, and overconsumption of processed meat.

Researchers found there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018 than in 1990 because of poor diet. Overall, diet contributed to over 14.1 million cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, representing over 70% of new diagnoses globally.

Eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents, CNN reported.

Researchers used information from the Global Dietary Database and a computer model to study dietary intake in 184 nations from 1990 to 2018. They also studied demographics from multiple sources, estimates of type 2 diabetes incidence around the world, and data on food choices and health from other papers, according to a news release[RE1] .",0

852,"This story is jointly reported by Brenda Goodman of WebMD and Andy Miller of Georgia Health News. Editor’s note: This story was updated Aug. 16, 2019, with additional details about the state of Georgia’s plan to conduct air tests for ethylene oxide. Aug. 14, 2019 -- Several Metro Atlanta communities are moving forward with plans to test air around two sterilizing facilities amid public pressure and concern about the release of toxic pollution in those areas. The Cobb County Commission on Tuesday approved funding for independent testing around the Sterigenics facility in Smyrna, GA. The commission is awaiting decisions by the Smyrna City Council and possibly the Atlanta City Council on whether they will split the cost of the test, which will sample ethylene oxide, according to the Marietta Daily Journal. And east of Atlanta, the city of Covington, GA, says on its Facebook page that it is “still vetting possible air quality testing companies"" as it plans to analyze its own air for ethylene oxide. The BD plant in Covington also uses the gas to sterilize medical products. A city spokesman said Wednesday that the City Council is expected to approve testing at a Monday meeting. Ethylene oxide is used on about half of the medical devices that require sterilization, according to the Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association. The chemical was classified as cancer-causing substance in 2016 by the EPA. On August 16, Georgia's Environmental Protection Division (EPD) offered specifics about its plan to test the air around the plants. It will collect air samples in Smyrna and Covington every six days over the next several months. Each community will have four monitoring locations ranging from a quarter mile to a mile from the plants. The equipment will be out in the next few weeks and results are expected in November. EPD earlier in the week had revealed results of an initial sample test for ethylene oxide at its South DeKalb County monitoring station. The agency said the test revealed an ethylene oxide concentration of 0.309 micrograms per cubic meter of air at that site, which is near Interstate 285 southeast of the city of Atlanta.

In a report about the test results, the EPA, which analyzed the sample, cautions that the sampling result is only an estimate because the testing equipment could not be properly calibrated. Scientists who reviewed the report say the results suggested that EPA detected ethylene oxide (also known as EtO) in the air around metro Atlanta, but that the exact amount of the chemical and any potential sources are still unknown. The level detected is roughly on par with the levels of ethylene oxide the EPA found in Willowbrook, IL, in the 6 weeks after the Sterigenics plant there was shut down Feb. 15. Experts interviewed about the sample result differ on its significance. “It’s very difficult to measure such tiny amounts of chemicals in the air accurately,"" says Janet McCabe, formerly the EPA’s acting assistant administrator for its Office of Air and Radiation, responding to a question about the South DeKalb test. “In this case, apparently, the equipment had not been checked (calibrated), so while the scientists are confident that it correctly detected [ethylene oxide] they are not confident in the exact reading,” McCabe says in an email. The EPD says there is no known industrial source of ethylene oxide emissions -- including the Sterigenics and BD plants -- within 15 miles of the South DeKalb site. The medical sterilizing industry has emphasized there are other sources of ethylene oxide, including from diesel trucks and other vehicles. Ethylene oxide disperses in outdoor air, but it doesn’t disappear for a long time. The chemical has a half-life of about 200 days in air, or almost 7 months. The half life is the time it takes for just half of the chemical to break down. The state’s report on the ethylene oxide sample does not include any data on wind direction at the time of the testing. In an email, Richard Peltier, PhD, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, says the results are “not precise, and wouldn’t be legally defensible, but probably correct within 10% to 15% of the real value.”

“It would certainly be cause for alarm as this is 15 times higher than what the EPA considers safe.” The toxic pollution issue in Georgia came to light after WebMD and Georgia Health News published a report last month. The report says that last year, the EPA identified 109 census tracts in the United States, including two in the Smyrna area, just northwest of Atlanta, and one in Covington, about 35 miles east of Atlanta, as having increased cancer risks, largely due to the use of ethylene oxide. The Smyrna and Covington areas, which first heard of the ethylene oxide problem from the report, held recent town hall meetings where scores of residents called for air testing. The Cobb Commission’s approval of funding for testing “is an important first step,"" says state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat who represents part of the Smyrna area. “I have every reason to believe that the city of Atlanta is willing to come to the table as well. Georgia EPD's failure to inform the affected communities of the increased risk has delayed the process long enough. With the beginning of the school year, the need for immediate action has now become critical."" In response to public pressure, the EPD, which months ago told reporters that there were no plans to conduct testing of the air around sterilizing plants, has revised that position. In addition to monitoring air around the plants, EPD said this week that it plans to conduct monitoring at a rural site in order to understand the differences between urban and rural concentrations. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat who represents the Covington area, has sent letters to the EPA and EPD, demanding answers on why his constituents were not informed about the chemical being released into the community’s air. Concentrations of ethylene oxide in neighborhoods around the Covington plant range from 17 to 97 times the acceptable area concentration or AAC, Johnson said in a letter to the EPA administrator, dated Monday. “Despite EPA’s knowledge of the significant danger ethylene oxide poses, the agency has seemingly failed to mitigate the release of the toxin. Moreover, the EPA has not issued any press releases about these findings notifying residents living within exposed areas -- failing to even notify families and communities that the very air they breathe could be poisonous.’’ The letter was also signed by U.S. Rep. David Scott and U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, both Georgia Democrats, along with state Reps. Susan Wild (D-PA) and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas).",0
853,"Heart medication shows potential as treatment for alcohol use disorder

A medication for heart problems and high blood pressure may also be effective for treating alcohol use disorder, according to a new study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and their colleagues. The study presents converging evidence from experiments in mice and rats, as well as a cohort study in humans, suggesting that the medication, spironolactone, may play a role in reducing alcohol drinking. The research was led by scientists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), both parts NIH, and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. A report of the new findings is published in Molecular Psychiatry.

“Combining findings across three species and different types of research studies, and then seeing similarities in those data, gives us confidence that we are onto something potentially important scientifically and clinically. These findings support further study of spironolactone as a potential treatment for alcohol use disorder, a medical condition that affects millions of people in the U.S” said Lorenzo Leggio, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Clinical Psychoneuroendocrinology and Neuropsychopharmacology Section, a joint laboratory of NIDA and NIAAA, and one of the senior authors.

Currently there are three medications approved for alcohol use disorder in the United States, and they are an effective and important aid in the treatment of people with this condition. Given the diverse biological processes that contribute to alcohol use disorder, new medications are needed to provide a broader spectrum of treatment options. Scientists are working to develop a larger menu of pharmaceutical treatments that could be tailored to individual needs.

Previous research has shown that mineralocorticoid receptors, which are located throughout the brain and other organs and help regulate fluid and electrolyte balance in the body, might play a role in alcohol use and craving. Preclinical research suggests that higher mineralocorticoid receptor signaling contributes to increased alcohol consumption. The current study sought to expand this line of research by testing spironolactone, a medication with multiple actions, including blocking mineralocorticoid receptors. Spironolactone is used in clinical practice as a diuretic and to treat conditions like heart problems and high blood pressure.

In experiments conducted in mouse and rat models of excessive alcohol drinking, NIAAA and NIDA researchers led by co-senior author Leandro Vendruscolo, Pharm.D., Ph.D., from NIDA found that increasing doses of spironolactone decreased alcohol consumption in male and female animals, without causing movement or coordination problems, and without affecting their food or water intake.

In a parallel study that was part of this team’s collaborative efforts, researchers led by co-senior author Amy C. Justice, M.D., Ph.D., of the Yale School of Medicine, examined health records of a large sample of people from the U.S. Veterans Affairs healthcare system to assess potential changes in alcohol drinking after spironolactone was prescribed for its current clinical indications (e.g., heart problems, high blood pressure). They found a significant association between spironolactone treatment and reduction in self-reported alcohol consumption, as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption, a screening tool. Of note, the largest effects were observed among those who reported hazardous/heavy episodic alcohol consumption before starting spironolactone treatment.

“These are very encouraging findings,” said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D., a co-author of the study. “Taken together, the present study argues for conducting randomized, controlled studies of spironolactone in people with alcohol use disorder to further assess its safety and potential efficacy in this population, as well as additional work to understand how spironolactone may reduce alcohol drinking.”

“Just like for any other medical condition, people with substance use disorders deserve to have a range of treatment options available to them, and this study is an exciting step in our effort to expand medications for people with alcohol use disorder,” said Nora Volkow, M.D., director of NIDA. “In addition, we must address the stigma and other barriers that prevent many people with alcohol use disorder from accessing the treatments we already have available.”

About the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol use disorder.

855,"Cambridge scientists have created a comprehensive tool for predicting an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer, which they say could help ensure that those men at greatest risk will receive the appropriate testing while reducing unnecessary -- and potentially invasive -- testing for those at very low risk.

CanRisk-Prostate, developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge and The Institute of Cancer Research, London, will be incorporated into the group's CanRisk web tool, which has now recorded almost 1.2 million risk predictions. The free tool is already used by healthcare professionals worldwide to help predict the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.

Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men. According to Cancer Research UK, over 52,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year and there are more than 12,000 deaths. Over three-quarters (78%) of men diagnosed with prostate cancer survive for over ten years, but this proportion has barely changed over the past decade in the UK.

Testing for prostate cancer involves a blood test that looks for a protein known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that is made only by the prostate gland; however, it is not always accurate. According to the NHS website, around three in four men with a raised PSA level will not have cancer. Further tests, such as tissue biopsies or MRI scans, are therefore required to confirm a diagnosis.

Professor Antonis Antoniou from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge said: ""Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, but population-wide screening based on PSA isn't an option: these tests are often falsely positive, which means that many men would then be biopsied unnecessarily. Also, many prostate tumours identified by PSA tests are slow-growing and would not have been life-threatening. The treatment of these tumours may do more harm than good.

""What we need is a way of identifying those men who are at greatest risk, allowing us to target screening and diagnostic tests where they are most needed, while also reducing the harms for those men who have low risk of the disease. This is what CanRisk-Prostate aims to do. For the first time, it combines information on the genetic makeup and prostate cancer family history, the main risk factors for the disease, to provide personalised cancer risks.""

Prostate cancer is one of the most genetically determined of common cancers. Inherited faulty versions of the BRCA2, HOXB13 and possibly BRCA1 genes are associated with moderate-to-high risk of prostate cancer, though such faults are rare in the population. In addition, there are several hundred more common genetic variants that each confer a lower risk, but in aggregate they act like 'volume control' that moderate or increase the prostate cancer risk.

Writing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the researchers -- supported by Cancer Research UK -- describe the development of the first comprehensive prostate cancer model using genetic and cancer family history data from almost 17,000 families affected by prostate cancer. It uses data on rare genetic faults in moderate-to-high-risk genes and a risk score based on 268 common low-risk variants, together with detailed cancer family history, to predict the future risks.

One in six men (16%) will develop prostate cancer by the time they are 85 years old. Using the model, the team found that the predicted risk was higher for men who had a father diagnosed with prostate cancer -- 27% if the father was diagnosed at an older age (80 years) but as high as 42% if the father was diagnosed at a young age (50 years).

The risks were considerably higher for men with genetic faults. For example, 54% of men who carry an alteration in the BRCA2 gene would develop prostate cancer -- however, among men with BRCA2 gene faults, the risks were substantially lower if they also had a small number of the low-risk variants, but much higher if they also had a large number of the low-risk variants.

In practice, say the researchers, clinicians will be able to use any combination of cancer family history, rare and common genetic variants to provide a personalised risk.

To validate their model, the team ran the risk model on an independent cohort of over 170,000 men recruited to UK Biobank, a biomedical database and research resource containing anonymised genetic, lifestyle and health information from half a million UK participants. All of these men were free from prostate cancer when they were recruited to the study, but more than 7,600 developed prostate cancer within the subsequent ten years.

When validating their model, the researchers found that 86% of the UK Biobank participants who developed cancer were in the half of men with the highest predicted risks, which suggests that it may be possible to target screening and diagnostic tests to the subgroup of the population at highest risk, among whom the majority of the cancers will occur.

Dr Tommy Nyberg from the MRC Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge said: ""We've created the most comprehensive tool to date for predicting a man's risk of developing prostate cancer. We hope this will help clinicians and genetic counsellors assess their clients' risk and provide the appropriate follow-up.

""Over the next 12 months, we aim to build this tool into the widely used CanRisk tool, which will facilitate the risk-based clinical management of men seen in family cancer clinics and enable risk-adapted early detection approaches to the population at large.""

Professor Ros Eeles from The Institute of Cancer Research, London and co-author on the study said: ""This is an important step forward as it will enable clinicians to have conversations with men about their individual risk of prostate cancer based on the most accurate computer model to date. This will help them in making decisions about screening.""

So far, the data used to develop CanRisk-Prostate has been from men of European ancestry. The team hope to be able to include data from men of other ethnicities as further research is undertaken.

The University of Cambridge recently launched the Early Cancer Institute with the aim of detecting cancer early enough to cure it. It is the first physical institute in the UK dedicated to early cancer. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital is also planned for the near future, bringing together clinical and research expertise in a new, world-class hospital, designed in partnership with patients.

There is also an Early Detection and Diagnosis centre at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust where a prostate risk clinic has been established to translate these findings into targeted screening programmes.

The research was supported by the Cancer Research UK-funded CanRisk programme. Additional support for CanRisk-Prostate was provided by Prostate Cancer UK, The Institute of Cancer Research, Everyman Campaign, National Cancer Research Network UK, National Cancer Research Institute, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.",0

857,"The advantages of living in cities for children and adolescents' healthy growth and development are shrinking across much of the world, according to a new global analysis of trends in child and adolescent height and body mass index (BMI) led by Imperial College London and published in Nature.

The research, by a global consortium of more than 1500 researchers and physicians, analysed height and weight data from 71 million children and adolescents (aged 5 to 19 years) across urban and rural areas of 200 countries from 1990 to 2020.

Cities can provide a multitude of opportunities for better education, nutrition, sports and recreation, and healthcare that contributed to school-aged children and adolescents living in cities being taller than their rural counterparts in the 20th century in all but a few wealthy countries.

The new study found that in the 21st century, this urban height advantage shrank in most countries as a result of accelerating improvements in height for children and adolescents in rural areas.

The study also assessed children's BMI -- an indicator of whether they have a healthy weight for their height. The researchers found that on average children living in cities had a slightly higher BMI than children in rural areas in 1990. By 2020, BMI averages rose for most countries, albeit faster for urban children, except in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where BMI rose faster in rural areas.

Nevertheless, over the 30-year period, the gap between urban and rural BMI remained small -- less than 1.1kg/m² globally (less than 2kg in weight for a child who is 130cm tall or less than 3kg in weight for an adolescent who is 160cm tall).

Dr Anu Mishra, lead author of the study, from Imperial College London's School of Public Health, said: ""Cities continue to provide considerable health benefits for children and adolescents. Fortunately, in most regions, rural areas are catching up to cities thanks to modern sanitation and improvements in nutrition and healthcare.

""The results of this large global study challenge the commonly held perceptions about the negative aspects of living in cities around nutrition and health.""

While height and BMI has increased around the world since 1990, the researchers found that the degree of change between urban and rural areas varied greatly among different middle and low-income countries, while small urban-rural differences remained stable across high-income countries.

Middle-income and emerging economies, such as Chile, Taiwan, and Brazil, have seen the biggest gains in rural children's height over the three decades, with children living in rural areas growing to similar heights as their urban counterparts.

Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author for the study, from Imperial College London's School of Public Health, said: ""These countries have made great strides in levelling up. Using the resources of economic growth to fund nutrition and health programmes, both through schools and in the community, was key to closing the gaps between different areas and social groups.""

And contrary to the widespread assumption that urbanisation is the main driver of the obesity epidemic, the study found that many high-income western countries have had very little difference in height and BMI over time -- with the gap between urban and rural BMI differing by less than one unit in 2020 (close to 1.5kg of weight for a child of 130cm).

Professor Ezzati added: ""The issue is not so much whether children live in cities or urban areas, but where the poor live, and whether governments are tackling growing inequalities with initiatives like supplementary incomes and free school meal programmes.""

The trend in sub-Saharan Africa is also a cause for concern, researchers say. Boys living in rural areas have plateaued in height or even become shorter over the three decades, in part because of the nutritional and health crises that followed the policy of structural adjustment in the 1980s.

Professor Andre Pascal Kengne, co-author for the study, from the South African Medical Research Council, said: ""Rural sub-Saharan Africa is now the global epicentre of poor growth and development for children and adolescents. As the cost of food skyrockets and countries finances get worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the rural poor in Africa are at risk of falling further behind.""

Particularly large height gaps between urban and rural boys in 2020 were seen in Rwanda (around 4cm) and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Mozambique -- all by 2-3.5cm.

Over time, boys and girls in sub-Saharan Africa also gained weight more rapidly in rural areas than cities, which meant that in some countries they went from being underweight to gaining too much weight for healthy growth.

Professor Ezzati said: ""This is a serious problem at every level, from individual to regional. Faltering growth in school-aged children and adolescents is strongly linked to poor health through life, lost educational attainment and the immense cost of unrealised human potential.""

""Our findings should motivate policies that counter poverty and make nutritious foods affordable to make sure that children and adolescents grow and develop into adults who have healthy and productive lives.

""Programmes like healthy food vouchers for low-income families and free school meal programmes can also provide lifelong benefits for children and adolescent's health and wellbeing.""",0
858,"April 17, 2023 – Americans have flocked to Canada to get the pricey, and very trendy, weight loss drug Ozempic. But Canadians are saying not so fast. British Columbia, a province in Canada, is banning Americans from purchasing the drug, which was created to treat type 2 diabetes, “to ensure that diabetes patients in British Columbia do not experience a shortage of the diabetes drug semaglutide (Ozempic) in an environment where surging demand in some jurisdictions is creating shortages.” The drug can cost up to $1,000 per month in the U.S. Meanwhile, in Canada, Ozempic can cost around $300 a month. The British Columbia Ministry of Health released a report that said thousands of U.S. residents have been filling their Ozempic prescriptions in its region. Out of the Ozempic dispensed in British Columbia, 15% (15,798 doses) were sold to Americans in January and February of this year. Don’t be surprised if other Canadian provinces follow suit, said Walter Oronsaye, PharmD, a Houston-based pharmacist who creates online content with information about prescription drugs, including drug shortages “If Ozempic is not used for diabetes purposes, most of the time it’s not covered by insurance,” he said. “That $1,000 a month is not something that a lot of people can afford. So, I think it's very likely for other parts of Canada to ban it as well.” In fact, Canada's national health minister said late last week he's working with other provinces to prevent mass export of the drug to U.S. patients, Canadian media reported. Mark Decerbo, PharmD, a Las Vegas-based pharmacist, said doctors frequently prescribe “off-label medications.” He also said that British Columbia’s power move could be the best move as well. “Undoubtedly, the popularity of this drug, both because of its efficacy, as well as its social media footprint, have contributed to shortages, as have the omni-present global supply chain disruptions of the raw materials needed to produce the drug,” he said. “In general, I fully support British Columbia's ban on Ozempic purchases for Americans, as any country's focus should always be on prioritizing the health and well-being of its own citizens over others.”

One of the most controversial issues in the Ozempic dispute: People who don’t have diabetes have been taking Ozempic solely for weight loss, leaving some people with type 2 diabetes without vital medication. Social media platforms, along with celebrity endorsements, have greatly boosted the popularity, and sales, of Ozempic for weight loss – which has added to the shortages. “There are Facebook groups offering ways for people to get Ozempic at cheaper prices,” Oronsaye said. “I’m sure there’s a group that discovered that people could buy Ozempic in Canada.” People without diabetes who take Ozempic say the controversy has been overblown. Annie Brown, 33, doesn't have diabetes and takes the drug to shed pounds. After being overweight her whole life, she loves that Ozempic makes your stomach “feel full even if you’re not.” Brown called Ozempic “a miracle drug”. She lost 14 pounds within 6 weeks of taking the drug, which is made by Novo Nordisk. She has gotten some online pushback, with some saying that she will gain weight if she stops taking it. “You're stealing from the diabetics"" and “You should feel ashamed of yourself” are other comments she has received. Carol Sortore, who is pre-diabetic but does not have type 2 diabetes, takes Ozempic to lose weight after her doctor prescribed the medication, which her insurance also covers. She says she understands the frustration of people who have diabetes if they can't get Ozempic due to shortages, but also said they have “a plethora of insulin options available to them,” which is not always the case for obese people. “If an individual and their physician have determined that this is a course of action for someone without diabetes to take, then I don’t think they should feel guilty,” Sortore said.",0
859,"Chronic alcohol use is a major cause of liver damage and death: Approximately 30,000 persons in the United States die annually from alcoholic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis. Among the negative impacts of excessive alcohol use is its ability to adversely affect the gut microbiome, though how that happens has been a mystery, since the majority of consumed alcohol is absorbed in the mouth and stomach and does not reach the intestines.

In a new study, published August 8, 2022 in Nature Communications, researchers at University of California San Diego, with colleagues elsewhere, propose an answer: Reprogramming of gut microbiota is caused by acetate produced by the liver diffusing back into the intestines where it becomes a carbon source to support bacterial growth.

""You can think of this a bit like dumping fertilizer on a garden,"" said co-corresponding author Karsten Zengler, PhD, professor in the departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Jacobs School of Engineering, respectively. ""The result is an explosion of imbalanced biological growth, benefitting some species but not others.""

Bernd Schnabl, MD, professor of medicine and gastroenterology at UC San Diego School of Medicine, is the other co-corresponding author.

Acetate is a nutrient used in cellular metabolism and has roles in appetite regulation, energy expenditure and immune response. In moderate levels, it promotes overall health, from improved cardiac function to enhanced red blood cell production and memory function. In excessive levels, it is associated with metabolic changes linked to disease, including cancer.

In the latest study, Zengler and colleagues fed mice a molecule that could be broken down into three acetates in the rodents' gut. The researchers noted the animals' intestinal microbiota were altered by the additional acetate in a way similar to what they observed when feeding alcohol to the mice, but without damaging effects to their livers.

""Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with lower intestinal expression of antimicrobial molecules. Persons will alcohol-related liver disease commonly have bacterial overgrowth in their guts,"" said Zengler. ""These findings suggest that microbial ethanol metabolism does not contribute significantly to gut microbiome dysbiosis (imbalance) and that the microbiome altered by acetate does not play a major role in liver damage.""

""The situation is more complicated than previously assumed. It's not as simple as more ethanol equals microbiome changes and thus, microbiome dysbiosis equals more liver disease. While this finding does not translate to imminent new treatments for alcoholic liver disease, it will help to delineate the effect of acetate on the microbiota and help refining future study designs.""

The authors said the findings are important because they move the investigation past whether ""changes in the gut microbiome are related to ethanol consumption per se are critical … and towards identifying bacteria that are causal for deleterious effects of alcohol consumption, rather than side-effects either of consumption or disease.""

861,"Solving one of the great mysteries of type 2 diabetes, a team of Yale researchers found that triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood and liver, are produced in the liver independent of insulin action in the liver.

In type 2 diabetics, insulin fails to suppress blood sugar production by the liver while paradoxically allowing the production of hepatic triglycerides. This combination results in multiple health risks, including high blood sugar and fatty liver disease. For years, to gain insight into this phenomenon, researchers focused on the role of altered insulin action in the liver in the production of triglycerides. However, Yale researchers tested a theory that triglycerides formed in the liver were more dependent on the delivery of fatty acids to the liver than on insulin action.

In their study, the Yale team -- led by Gerald I. Shulman, the George R. Cowgill professor of medicine and cellular & molecular physiology -- developed a novel method to measure the rate of triglyceride production from fatty acids in three types of animals: normal rats, insulin-resistant rats fed a high-fat diet, and rats with genetically modified insulin receptors. They found that in all of the animals tested increased triglyceride production was primarily dependent on fatty acid delivery and not on insulin action in the liver.

The findings also explain the long-standing paradox of why insulin therapy does not exacerbate, but instead reduces, fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. ""These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic liver disease and provides new approaches to treat fatty liver disease, which is now the most common liver disease in the world,"" said Shulman.

Shulman and his team plan to apply similar methodology to translate their findings to insulin-resistant patients with type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease.",0

The method, published in a new study in the journal Scientific Reports, detects gait problems 15 to 20 years before their clinical diagnosis and could help advance intervention models to preserve brain structure and function.

""Walking patterns can be a revealing trait of health, but gait symptoms of disorders like Fragile X can escape the naked eye for years until they are visibly noticeable,"" said study coauthor Elizabeth Torres, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and director of the Sensory Motor Integration Lab. ""Given issues with anatomical differences -- such as people with longer or shorter limbs -- and disease complexity, it has remained challenging to use walking patterns to screen nervous system disorders more broadly, across disorders impacting people of different ages and developmental stages.""

The National Organization for Rare Disorders notes over 30 percent of people with SHANK3 deletion typically require two or more chromosome studies before the deletion is detected. As such, the estimated prevalence is 2.5-10 per million births with equal likelihood of males and females being affected.

In the study, researchers examined the walking movements that cannot be seen by the naked eye in 189 people to detect nervous system disorders.

The microscopic movements are detectable using statistical techniques developed by Torres and causal forecasting methods developed by Rutgers graduate student Theodoros Bermperidis, alongside wearable motion-sensored sneakers created by Stevens Institute of Technology collaborators.

The researchers combined gait data from various patients and those without any disorders using video, heart rates and wearable technology like a Fitbit. Participants completed a simple walking task while wearing the smart shoes that collected an assortment of signals across the body and feet.

Torres and her team analyzed how the spikes derived from microvariations in the movements' stream, changed from moment to moment and at what rate. Instead of taking grand averages that discard these spikes as noise, they examined peaks, valleys and neighboring points surrounding the peaks, and causally determined important lags in the spikes' timing.

The study provides a framework to help predict the early departure of normal walking patterns in healthy young people, both for normal aging and for participants who are Fragile X carriers. The methods help stratify a random draw of the population with autism-related disorders.

""Given that Fragile X and SHANK3-related syndromes remain high in other neurological conditions such as autism, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and Parkinson's, this is an important way to detect signs of abnormal patterns,"" said lead author Bermperidis.

According to the research, gait declines naturally with typical aging. However,the hip, knee and ankle joints and the thigh, leg and foot bones are the first limbs impacted by aging.

Doctors face the challenge of diagnosing a patient that comes to their office for the first time showing unusual gait patterns. Torres says biosensors paired with analytics and the doctor's broad experience can altogether offer much more than meets the eye.

Study co-authors included Richa Rai, a graduate student at Rutgers, Jihye Ryu, a former Rutgers student and researchers from Stevens Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

864,"Two new studies may lead to the development of more effective therapies for individuals with multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable blood cell cancer. The research, published by Cell Press in the August issue of the journal Cancer Cell, provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie aberrant NF-ºB activity in MM tumor cells and underscores the relevance of the NF-ºB signaling pathway as a target for MM therapy.

MM is a cancer of the plasma cell, a blood cell that produces antibodies to help the body fight off infections. Previous research implicates abnormal activation of the NF-ºB signaling pathway as a key event in MM pathology. NF-ºB target genes are known to be involved in cell proliferation and cell survival. Although there is significant overlap and interplay between them, there are two separate pathways that lead to activation of NF-ºB, the classical pathway and the alternative pathway.

Constitutive activation of NF-ºB to block apoptosis has been implicated in various types of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not well understood. Two separate research groups used a variety of sophisticated genomic techniques to examine mutations in hundreds of MM patient samples and cell lines to identify mutations that impact NF-ºB activation.

Dr. Louis M. Staudt from the National Cancer Institute led a research group who revealed the importance of both the classical and alternative NF-ºB pathways in MM pathogenesis. Most MM patient samples examined exhibited NF-ºB pathway activation via diverse genetic abnormalities. Importantly, targeted disruption of the classical NF-ºB signaling blocked myeloma proliferation and induced cell death. ""These genetic and functional data provide a molecular framework for the rational development of NF-ºB pathway inhibitors for the therapy of MM,"" offers Dr. Staudt.

In a separate study, Dr. Rafael Fonseca, from the Mayo Clinic Arizona, and colleagues report mutations in several genes that result in constitutive activation of the alternative NF-ºB pathway. ""We propose that the acquisition of the mutations identified in our study results in the accumulation of malignant plasma cells beyond the physiological control of the bone marrow compartment. Our results suggest a mechanism by which MM cells can overcome these limitations through acquisition of mutations that result in constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the alternative NF-ºB pathway,"" explains Dr. Fonseca.

Taken together, results for these studies define diverse mutations that lead to pathological activation of NF-ºB signaling in MM and describe a shift of plasma cells from dependence on the microenvironment to an environment-independent state during progression of MM. Regardless of the specific method of activation, the NF-ºB pathway plays a central role in MM pathogenesis and is an excellent target for development of new therapeutics.

865,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Despite improvements in median and short-term survival rates for patients with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor in adults, the percentage of patients achieving five-year survival remains low, according to new Mayo Clinic research.

A study to be published next month in Mayo Clinic Proceedings finds that little has changed in terms of five-year survival — only 5.5% of patients live for five years after diagnosis — and calls for more aggressive treatments to be considered for all glioblastoma patients.

Gliomas represent about 75% of malignant primary brain tumors, according to previous studies, and glioblastoma, grade 4 glioma, is among the most aggressive forms of cancer. The retrospective analysis of 48,652 cases in the National Cancer Database from January 2004 through December 2009 found that 2,249 patients survived at least five years after diagnosis. Among those who reached five-year survival, the median length of survival was 88 months. Patients who did not survive five years had a median survival of just seven months.

""The introduction of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma was revolutionary, although this research suggests that chemotherapy serves more as a temporizing measure against disease recurrence and death,"" says Daniel Trifiletti, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist and senior author of the study. ""Considerable work needs to be done to provide hope for patients with glioblastoma.""

The study involved oncology, radiation and biomedical statistics researchers from Mayo Clinic's Florida and Minnesota campuses, and East Tennessee State University.

According to the study, factors associated with five-year survival included age, race and gender. Those who achieved five-year survival were relatively younger adults, female and nonwhite. Other factors included generally good health, higher median income, tumors that were on the left side of the brain or outside the brainstem, and treatment with radiotherapy. Contrary to previous studies, tumor size did not appear to affect the odds of long-term survival significantly.

The findings suggest that more aggressive treatments that focus on long-term survival will be needed. ""Although it is uncertain how this may be achieved, it likely will require novel and radical approaches to treatment of the disease,"" Dr. Trifiletti says. The study recommends that nearly all patients should be offered enrollment in a clinical trial.

Dr. Trifiletti says there are several studies underway testing promising new surgeries, radiation techniques and drug therapies. ""To me, the most exciting area is in cellular therapy,"" he says. ""In my lab, I am evaluating the possibility of using targeted cellular therapy as an agent that can synergize with existing therapies, including radiation.""

Dr. Trifiletti discloses that he has received research grants from NovoCure, and Paul D. Brown, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist and co-author, serves on the data and safety monitoring panel of IQVIA Biotech. The other authors report no competing interests.

866,"Researchers have reported findings that add to our knowledge of how human behavior may be shaped by the default mode network, a specific network of brain regions with both resting and task-related states. The article, ""Reward enhances connectivity between the ventral striatum and the default mode network,"" was epublished on June 18, 2022, in NeuroImage. The authors are Ekaterina Dobryakova, PhD, of Kessler Foundation and David V. Smith, PhD, of Temple University.

The default mode network (DMN), which comprises the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral temporal-parietal regions, has been shown to be engaged in several task-related behaviors. Studies show that DMN activity increases during inward-directed thought and decreases during externally directed tasks requiring focused attention. Despite evidence for a role for the DMN in shaping behavior, little is known about how task-related changes in the DMN influence connectivity with other brain regions. For example, while some observations indicate an indirect relationship between the DMN and the striatum, how the DMN and striatum interact during tasks remains unclear.

To further explore the functions of the DMN, Drs. Dobryakova and Smith applied a novel analysis to the reward task, using behavioral and neuroimaging data from 495 randomly selected individuals in the Human Connectome Project, an open access database of healthy participants. The goals of this network-based psycho-physiological interaction analysis were twofold, according to Dr. Dobryakova, a senior research scientist in the Foundation's Center for Traumatic Brain Injury Research. ""First, to test the effects of reward on connectivity between the DMN and the striatum; and second, whether such connectivity is associated with behavioral and personality characteristics relevant to reward processing,"" she explained.

In line with other studies, during the task, they observed decreased activation of the DMN and relative increased activation of other networks. ""Most notably, we found that the experience of reward enhanced connectivity between the DMN and the ventral striatum,"" Dr. Dobryakova reported, ""an effect specific to the DMN. We were also surprised that the strength of this connectivity correlated with personality characteristics relating to openness,"" she added.

Greater understanding of the workings of the healthy brain will influence future research and care for individuals with neuropsychiatric syndromes. ""Improving our understanding of the interaction of the DMN with other brain networks has the potential to aid clinical research into better treatments for common syndromes such as depression, substance abuse, and schizophrenia,"" Dr. Dobryakova concluded.

The atlas could be a vital resource for brain research and has already led to a potential targetable vulnerability for therapeutic intervention of aggressive medulloblastomas, a type of fast-growing malignant tumors that form in the back of the brain. Thanks to data from the new fetal brain atlas, scientists have discovered a rare population of progenitor cells that give rise to group 3 medulloblastomas. Although mice were used to learn if the newly discovered progenitor cells could be attacked, eliminating or reducing their activity did not reverse tumor formation triggered by hyperactivity of the MYC gene. Nevertheless, early success in mouse models is sufficient for the production of a treatment to help future children diagnosed with this aggressive form of brain tumor.

The drug was tested in rats, and the findings were published online today in JCI Insight.

""Erectile dysfunction (ED) after radical prostatectomy has a major impact on the lives of many patients and their partners,"" said study co-leader David J. Sharp, Ph.D., professor of physiology & biophysics and of ophthalmology and visual sciences and professor in the Dominick P. Purpura Department of Neuroscience at Einstein. ""Since rats are reliable animal models in urologic research, our drug offers real hope of normal sexual function for the tens of thousands of men who undergo this surgery each year.""

Radical prostatectomy -- surgery to remove the prostate gland -- is considered the definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. ""Despite the advent of so-called nerve-sparing procedures, the surgery can damage the cavernous nerves, which control erectile function by regulating blood flow to the penis,"" said study co-leader Kelvin P. Davies, Ph.D., professor of urology and of physiology & biophysics at Einstein. He notes that about 60% of patients report having ED 18 months after surgery, and fewer than 30% have erections firm enough for intercourse after five years. Viagra and similar ED treatments are rarely effective in these patients, he said.

A decade ago, Dr. Sharp and colleagues discovered that the enzyme fidgetin-like 2 (FL2) puts the brakes on skin cells as they migrate towards wounds to heal them. To speed wound healing, the researchers developed an ""anti-FL2"" drug: small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) that inhibit the gene that codes for FL2. Packaged in gel nanoparticles and sprayed on mice, the siRNAs not only healed wounds twice as fast as untreated wounds but also regenerated damaged tissue. A February 2021 study in rats found that the siRNAs also aided the healing of corneal alkaline burns.

Dr. Sharp, Dr. Davies, and their teams realized that injured nerves might be especially amenable to this gene-silencing drug: For unknown reasons, the FL2 gene becomes over-active after injury to nerve cells, causing the cells to produce copious amounts of FL2 enzyme.

The Einstein team evaluated the drug using rat models of peripheral nerve injury in which the cavernous nerves were either crushed or severed, mimicking the nerve damage associated with radical prostatectomy. The siRNA gel was applied to the nerves immediately after injury.

When treatment was applied following a nerve crush injury, siRNA treatment enhanced nerve regeneration (regrowth) and restored nerve function as shown by cavernosometry, a test in which blood pressure within the penile shaft is measured after cavernous nerves are electrically stimulated. At three and four weeks post-therapy, the treated animals had significantly better erectile function compared to controls. After a month, the blood pressure response of the treated animals was comparable to that of normal animals.

Remarkably, even after nerves were severed, the drug treatment induced nerve regeneration and partial recovery of erectile function. Regenerated nerves were observed in 7 out of 8 treated animals, but not in any of the control animals (severed nerves treated with nonfunctioning siRNAs). The siRNA drug was able to heal gaps of several millimeters between the severed nerve ends -- a result previously achieved only by nerve grafting, according to Dr. Sharp. ""Functionally, the result from siRNA treatment was equivalent to or better than nerve grafting,"" he added.

The researchers also found that penile shafts of treated animals had higher levels of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase compared to controls. The enzyme produces the nitric oxide needed to trigger the sequence of events leading to erections. ""This is important because drugs like Viagra don't work if there's no nitric oxide to kick things off,"" said Dr. Sharp. ""But if we can restore even some of the nitric oxide in these nerves, Viagra and other ED drugs may then be able to exert their effects.""

Dr. Sharp's team is currently studying whether the siRNAs can promote nerve regeneration after spinal cord injuries.

The study is titled ""Fidgetin-like 2 negatively regulates axonal growth and can be targeted to promote functional nerve regeneration.""

872,"DNA-based “liquid biopsy” could help save lives and reduce health disparities.

Researchers have developed a blood test that could make it possible for doctors to detect — then quickly prevent or slow down — acute heart transplant rejection, a potentially deadly condition that occurs in the early months after a patient has received a donor heart. They estimate that the test could eliminate up to 80% of invasive heart tissue biopsies currently used to detect rejection.

In studies of a group of nearly 200 heart transplant recipients, the new blood test performed better than tissue biopsies, as it signaled problems even when no outward signs of rejection were evident.

The study was primarily funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study’s findings are scheduled to appear January 13 in Circulation, a publication of the American Heart Association.

“There’s an urgent need for an alternative method to monitor patients for acute heart transplant rejection,” said Sean Agbor-Enoh, M.D., Ph.D., study co-author and chief of the NHLBI’s Laboratory of Applied Precision Omics.

“We showed in our initial assessment that this ‘liquid biopsy’ is highly sensitive for detecting acute rejection, finding it weeks to months before current clinical tools. This could potentially save lives in the wake of a critical shortage of donor organs,” said Hannah Valantine, M.D., senior study author and the former lead investigator of the Laboratory of Organ Transplant Genomics in the Cardiovascular Branch at the NHLBI.

Currently a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and a noted pioneer in transplantation research, Valantine said the test is also important for addressing serious health disparities. Because African Americans tend to have higher rates of heart transplant rejection and experience poorer transplant outcomes than other groups nationwide, the test could help reduce existing transplant-related health disparities that have persisted for decades.

The test, called the donor-derived cell-free DNA test, tracks DNA markers from the organ donor that appear in the blood of the transplant recipient. Because injured or dying cells from the donor organ release lots of donor DNA fragments into the bloodstream compared to normal cells, higher amounts of donor DNA indicate a higher risk for transplant rejection in the recipient. The biomarkers can be detected using specialized lab equipment.

Current tests used to detect heart transplant rejection rely on frequent and painful biopsies of heart tissue. Those biopsies run the risk of damaging the heart and are limited by their invasiveness (ability to obtain tissue samples) and reliability for detecting acute rejection. Acute, or rapid, rejection tends to happen in the first three to six months after transplantation as opposed to chronic rejection, which occurs after many years.

In the current study, the research team collected blood samples from 171 people who had recently undergone heart transplantation at one of five regional transplant centers within or near the Washington, D.C.-metropolitan area. The sampling included nearly 2,000 cell-free DNA measurements. The population included a high percentage (about 44%) of African Americans. The researchers monitored the patients for signs of acute rejection for nearly 18 months using both traditional endomyocardial (heart tissue) biopsy and the new blood test.

The researchers found that the blood test performed better in their study than tissue biopsy, detecting higher amounts of rejection markers and earlier signs of rejection. It also detected more instances of other types of transplant injury that were missed by biopsy, including so-called antibody mediated rejection, one of the deadliest forms of rejection and the hardest to treat and diagnose. The new blood test may be able to detect rejection as early as 28 days after heart transplantation and at least three months before rejection is detectable using heart tissue biopsy.

Also, while current heart biopsies are only performed in hospitals, specimens for the new blood test can be collected at almost any commercial blood-collecting center. Since the blood test may lead to fewer biopsies, it could also provide significant financial savings. In addition, the noninvasive blood test may provide a potentially safer alternative to invasive biopsies during viral outbreaks like the current COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the new test still has limitations. “This test will not completely eliminate the need for invasive procedures, but it can eliminate about 80% of the biopsies currently performed after heart transplant,” said study co-author Palak Shah, M.D., a heart disease specialist at Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, Falls Church, Virginia.

Researchers need to conduct additional clinical studies, including a randomized controlled trial, to confirm these findings, but they are using the blood test to further study the mechanisms underlying acute rejection and explore why African Americans tend to have higher rates of transplant rejection, with the goal of eliminating this health disparity. If future testing in a clinical trial validates the safety and efficacy of the new test, it could become a routine tool used to monitor heart transplant patients for early stages of rejection, the researchers said. The exact timeline for its clinical availability is unclear, they noted.

874,"This National Diabetes Month, be the center of your diabetes care

Statement from Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers, Director, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

More than 30 million people in the United States have diabetes – and each one is the most important member of their diabetes care team. This National Diabetes Month, I urge everyone with diabetes to make your care a joint effort between you, your loved ones and your health care team.

In addition to managing blood glucose (often called blood sugar), blood pressure, and cholesterol, and not smoking, people with diabetes need to make healthy food choices, stay at a healthy weight, move more every day, and take their medicine even when they feel good. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it – research has shown that these efforts can dramatically lower the risk of many diabetes-related health problems, including heart, kidney, nerve, and eye diseases. Having a network of support can help people with diabetes cope with the daily demands that come with diabetes and help them be more successful in managing their health.

But there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to diabetes care, and treatment plans need to consider each person’s values, goals, needs, and preferences. Developing realistic goals – such as taking breaks for short walks during the day if you are too tired to be active in the evening– can help you manage your diabetes in a way that works for you.

At NIH, we are learning more about the importance of taking each person’s needs into account through research taking a “precision medicine” approach where a person’s genes, environment, lifestyle and other factors all help determine the best treatment for that person.

The NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) supports a wide range of research, including testing the most effective approaches for diabetes care for individuals. The ongoing Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study is comparing four drugs as additions to metformin, the most common first-line type 2 diabetes medication, to determine which drug works best to manage the disease in different people.

NIDDK research seeks to help all people with or at risk for diabetes. For example, Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet screens more than 16,000 people with a family history of type 1 annually to find ways to delay or prevent the disease.

To find recruiting medical trials funded by NIDDK, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov and search “diabetes.” Type “NIDDK” in the “Other Terms” box.

Diabetes takes multiple forms. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the most common type, the body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin well.

As we learn more about how to treat and someday prevent all types of diabetes, we hope you’ll use this National Diabetes Month as a chance to take charge of your health. Go to health visits with questions you may have. Start making small changes to your lifestyle. Learn more about diabetes with free health information from the NIDDK at www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information. Find even more ways to improve your diabetes health with the National Diabetes Education Program, a joint program of NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the NIH, we’re committed to improving outcomes for all people with diabetes. This National Diabetes Month, we encourage everyone with diabetes to take center stage in their health care and to set health goals that work for you.

The NIDDK, part of the NIH, conducts and supports basic and clinical research and research training on some of the most common, severe, and disabling conditions affecting Americans.

There is no national plan for what to do about the election if a coronavirus outbreak puts our cities on lockdown and fills our hospitals in November. But that doesn't mean there isn't a straightforward fix.
The answer is to take the vote-by-mail option that operates as a backup for the in-person polling in most states and prepare it to become the primary means of voting in November. This will require the states to both print the necessary additional ballots and to distribute them in a timely manner to registered voters. They'd need to step up their game swiftly: In the 2016 election, only about 24 percent of voters cast ballots by mail (either vote-by-mail or absentee). Only three states--Oregon, Washington, and Colorado--had all of their ballots cast by mail, while another six had over half their votes cast as absentee ballots. In all, 25 states have at least some form of vote-by-mail option, but in most of them it's a limited option.
Congress cannot mandate that the states prepare to carry out the November elections entirely via mail-in ballots, any more than they could mandate the nationwide transition to electronic voting in the early 2000s. But as with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which threw money at the states to make a four-year switch to e-voting, if Congress acts quickly it can help the states cover the cost of a major vote-by-mail rollout. It's reasonable to hope that we can move to vote-by-mail in just a few months, because unlike the e-voting transition, vote-by-mail just involves scaling up the the states' existing absentee ballot systems and not deploying an entirely new suite of technologies.

Sept. 28, 2022 -- The Biden administration is pushing to change nutrition labels on food packaging to help people eat better and to encourage manufacturers to make healthier products.

One change would be putting food labels on the front of packaging, or FOP.

The Food and Drug Administration will research FOP labeling, the White House announced Tuesday as part of its efforts to battle hunger and support nutrition.

FOP labels should help shoppers, “particularly those with lower nutrition literacy,” quickly see which foods are “part of a healthy eating pattern,” the White House said.

The FOP labeling could come in a variety of forms, including star ratings. It won’t replace longer nutrition labels on the back of products.

The administration also wants to make it harder for producers to claim foods are “healthy” without providing information to support the claim.

Manufacturers would be able to label products “healthy” if they have a significant amount of food from one of the food groups, the proposed guidelines say. And they have to follow certain limits on things like fat, sodium and added sugars, The Washington Post reported.",0

Prostate cancer accounts for a quarter of new cancer cases in men, and diagnosing it at an early stage can double 5-year survival rates. GPs do not make around 800,000 suspected prostate cancer referrals annually in the UK. However, incorporating genetic risk for cancer into GP triage may lead to unnecessary investigations for some patients. The PSA test is accurate but may miss up to 15% of cancers.

880,"Aug. 17, 2022 -- After the monkeypox virus has been found in a dog, U.S. health experts are expanding their quarantine recommendations.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging afflicted people to quarantine their pets for three weeks. The idea is to help curb the spread of the disease, following news that a dog in France tested positive.

“Infected animals can spread Monkeypox virus to people, and it is possible that people who are infected can spread Monkeypox virus to animals through close contact, including petting, cuddling, hugging, kissing, licking, sharing sleeping areas, and sharing food,” the CDC said.

Pets exposed to somebody with monkeypox should be separated from people and other animals for 21 days, the CDC says. People who are infected should let others care for their pets.

“If the person with monkeypox did NOT have close contact with pets after symptom onset, ask friends or family members who live in a separate home to be the animal’s caretaker until the person with monkeypox fully recovers,” the CDC adds.",0

The annual report, which examines crime and safety in schools and colleges, also found a rise in cyberbullying and verbal abuse or disrespect of teachers during the past decade.

“While the lasting impact of these crime and safety issues cannot be measured in statistics alone, these data are valuable to the efforts of our policymakers, school officials and community members to identify and implement preventive and responsive measures,” Peggy Carr, PhD, the commissioner for the National Center for Education Statistics, said in a statement.

886,"SAN DIEGO — Mayo Clinic researchers were among international experts who presented findings at Digestive Disease Week 2019, the world's largest gathering of physicians, researchers and industry leaders in gastroenterology and related fields.

Digestive Disease Week 2019 was held May 18–21 in San Diego. The meeting featured 5,400 lectures, poster presentations and oral abstract presentations. Mayo researchers were available to discuss their studies and findings with reporters during the conference.

Among the more than 40 Mayo studies and presentations featured were:

""Pancreatic Cancer Detection by Plasma Assay of Novel Methylated DNA Markers: A Case-Control Study""

Embargoed until presentation on Monday, May 20, from noon to 2 p.m. PDT.

Early detection of pancreatic cancer can lead to improved long-term survival. The only available blood-based biomarker is unreliable for detecting early-stage carcinoma, but this Mayo Clinic study, conducted in collaboration with Exact Sciences Corporation, of Madison, Wisconsin, demonstrates that a new blood-based DNA marker can accurately detect pancreatic cancer across all stages.

""A blood-based biomarker like the one described in this study, once validated prospectively, could be clinically used for early detection in patients at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer,"" says Shounak Majumder, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and the study's lead author.

Using blood samples from 340 patients — 170 pancreatic cancer patients and 170 normal controls — the study found that a panel of DNA markers in combination with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) detected 92% of all cancers, including 79% of stage 1 cancers. The combination of these DNA markers with CA 19-9 significantly improves cancer detection, compared to CA 19-9 alone. A prospective study to validate these results is underway at Mayo Clinic.

""Noninvasive Screening for Barrett's Esophagus Using an Electronic Nose""

Embargoed until poster presentation on Saturday, May 18, from noon to 2 p.m. PDT.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in the U.S., and it typically isn't diagnosed until advanced stages. The only known precursor for the disease is Barrett's esophagus, which also goes undetected as an asymptomatic condition that requires an endoscopy for diagnosis.

This Mayo Clinic study evaluated a new screening method for Barrett's esophagus, using an electronic nose device, called an ""e-nose,"" to analyze the patient's exhaled breath. The device can detect volatile organic compounds associated with Barrett's esophagus. The study showed that a distinctive signature for Barrett's esophagus can be detected with fairly high accuracy, according to lead author Juan Reyes Genere, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterology fellow.

Researchers prospectively invited patients with established Barrett's esophagus and controls without Barrett's esophagus to provide breath samples prior to routine, clinically indicated endoscopy. They found that the accuracy was high, especially among patients taking a high-dose proton pump inhibitor, an acid reduction medicine.

""It was surprising to see the dosage of acid-reducing medication made a significant difference to the accuracy,"" Dr. Reyes Genere says. ""Stomach acid is a protective barrier that kills bacteria entering our gastrointestinal tract. Reducing stomach acid permits more bacterial colonization in the gut, thereby enhancing the volatile organic compound signatures.""

This effect was noticeably reduced in patients on low-dose medications, he says. The research team is now testing this model in blinded samples.

Embargoed until Tuesday, May 21, at 3 p.m. PDT.

Dumping syndrome is a condition that frequently occurs after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, in which patients experience various symptoms after eating a meal, including low blood sugar, palpitation and diaphoresis. It can severely affect quality of life and at times requires reversal of the bariatric surgery.

Mayo Clinic researchers reviewed a multicenter series of patients who were treated for refractory dumping syndrome, with the goal of proposing a multidisciplinary management strategy for such patients. The study found that a minimally invasive endoscopic treatment option is safe and effective at improving symptoms and reducing rates of surgical revision.

""Before these findings, a large therapeutic gap between medications and reversal of their gastric bypass surgery existed for these patients,"" says Eric Vargas, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterology fellow. ""We believe our study adds a much-needed treatment alternative using endoscopy for patients who have failed medications but are concerned about undergoing gastric bypass reversal.""

""Sensitivity of Computerized Tomography During Prediagnostic Course of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma""

Embargoed until May 18 e-poster tour, from 1:20 to 1:50 p.m. PDT. Other presentations are May 20 from 11:45 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PDT, and poster on May 20 from noon to 2 p.m. PDT.

Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) offers the best hope for improved disease survival. Though strategies are being developed to test and screen asymptomatic high-risk patients, it's unclear whether routine imaging, such as CT scans, is effective.

Mayo Clinic researchers retrospectively looked at high-resolution CT scans that were performed on patients for other reasons prior to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma diagnosis. According to Suresh Chari, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist, findings suggestive of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were seen on CT scans in a majority of patients six months prior to diagnosis, when patients were asymptomatic.

Dhruv Singh, M.B.B.S., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterology research fellow, says the findings suggest that early CT screening for asymptomatic high-risk individuals may identify nonmetastatic disease, improving patient survival.

""Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%,"" Singh says. ""The mortality is high because by the time the cancer clinically presents, it is advanced and difficult to surgically resect. Our study shows that CT imaging, when used in the target population, can pick up subtle changes in the pancreas before PDAC becomes symptomatic.""

All abstracts selected for presentation at Digestive Disease Week 2019 have been published online in the April supplement to Gastroenterology or in the April supplement to Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

""Congress just introduced a bill. HR6666. it gives 100 billion dollars to schools, churches, and medical buildings ... the only way they can receive the money is to agree by contract that they will only allow people into their facilities that have the COVID-19 vaccination [and] are tested and tracked.""
This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:

HR 6666 has also been the subject of false claims that it hides a conspiracy to forcefully quarantine, vaccinate or control Americans, and that even the bill's number -- 6666 -- makes it suspect as ""the bill of the beast."" Numbers on Senate and House bills are simply consecutive, spit out by a computer based on however many bills came before.
So, what does HR 6666 really do? The bill, as introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, is found here.
It would provide $100 billion in grants to faith-based organization, clinics, medical centers, and other organization that perform testing for COVID-19, tracing of exposure to COVID-19, or services for patients who are isolating at home. The bill protects the privacy of people tested. The money is to be used to pay staff of these mobile units or purchase personal protective equipment to protect their staff. It was designed to improve Americans' health through mobile testing in medically underserved areas. It is being called the TRACE Act: COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone.
Its priority is to bring testing to ""hot spots,"" which means a geographic area where the rate of infection with COVID-19 exceeds the national average.
Requiring vaccinations is not -- and cannot -- be part of the bill because a COVID-19 vaccine is months-to-years away. More than 60 candidate vaccines are now in development, worldwide, and only a few have entered early clinical trials in human volunteers.
Developing a safe, effective vaccine against a new health threat typically takes years, and sometimes decades. That's because, unlike with experimental treatments, it's impossible to know right away if a vaccine has worked.
The first COVID-19 vaccine to enter clinical trials, for example, uses a genetic molecule called mRNA as its base. Scientists generate the mRNA in the lab and, rather than directly injecting SARS-CoV-2 into patients, they introduce this mRNA. By design, the vaccine should prompt human cells to build proteins found on the virus' surface and thus trigger a protective immune response to it.

890,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet?
• Fat (found in animal and dairy products, nuts, and oils)
• Carbohydrates (found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and other legumes)
• Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)
• Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)
• Water (both in what you drink, and what's naturally in foods) Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs.
• Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk.
• Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat.
• You don't have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.
• If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day.
• Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days. That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms.

Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats:
• Saturated fats: found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions, a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.
• Polyunsaturated fats: These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil).
• Monounsaturated fats: These come from plant sources. They're found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.
• Cholesterol: Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.
• Trans fat: Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. They're bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says ""0 g trans fat"" may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So also check the ingredients list: If it mentions ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, those are trans fats.

Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",0
891,"Dec. 3, 2022 -- With COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations rising quickly, Los Angeles County may require indoor masking in public spaces soon.

Face masks would be required in indoor spaces if the county hits the metrics that move it from a medium level of community transmission into a high level as defined by the CDC, County Public Health Department Director Barbara Ferrer said at a news conference Thursday. 

""There is this common line of thinking that the pandemic is over and COVID is no longer of concern, but these numbers clearly demonstrate that COVID is still with us,"" she said.

To move into the high transmission category, the county would need to exceed these metrics: a case rate exceeding 200 per 100,000 residents, hospital admissions for COVID of 10 per 100,000 residents, and having 10% of staffed hospital beds occupied by COVID patients.

The county is now reporting 185 new cases per 100,000 people, the health department said in a news release, and new COVID hospital admission rates hit 11.9% as of Thursday. However, the percentage of hospital beds occupied by COVID patients was only 5.6% as of Thursday, The Los Angeles Times reported, up from 2% in early November.

The county’s seven-day average case count is 3,053, about 44% higher than a week ago, the news release said. Over the last seven days, the average number of daily COVID-positive hospital patients has grown from 760 to 1,056, the release said.

The county recently moved from a low to medium level of community transmission. If the metrics push the county into the high community transmission category, the county government could decide to implement the rule several weeks later, Ferrer said.

The BA.5 subvariant of Omicron is “rapidly losing dominance,” the health department news release said. BA.5 snow makes up about 36% of sequenced specimens while the subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 now account for 38% of specimens.

""Given both the increases in hospitalizations and the lack of certainty in the winter trajectory for COVID-19, continuing some common-sense mitigation strategies that we know work to limit transmission and illness, including masking and being up to date on vaccines and boosters, remains a very sensible approach,"" Ferrer said.",0

895,"Gene mutation points to new way to fight diabetes, obesity, heart disease

Researchers say they have discovered a gene mutation that slows the metabolism of sugar in the gut, giving people who have the mutation a distinct advantage over those who do not. Those with the mutation have a lower risk of diabetes, obesity, heart failure, and even death. The researchers say their finding could provide the basis for drug therapies that could mimic the workings of this gene mutation, offering a potential benefit for the millions of people who suffer with diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.

The study, which is largely supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health, appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

“We’re excited about this study because it helps clarify the link between what we eat, what we absorb, and our risk for disease. Knowing this opens the door to improved therapies for cardiometabolic disease,” said Scott D. Solomon, M.D., a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a senior physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who led the research. He explained that the study is the first to fully evaluate the link between mutations in the gene mainly responsible for absorbing glucose in the gut — SGLT-1, or sodium glucose co-transporter-1 — and cardiometabolic disease.

People who have the natural gene mutation appear to have an advantage when it comes to diet, Solomon noted. Those who eat a high-carbohydrate diet and have this mutation will absorb less glucose than those without the mutation. A high-carbohydrate diet includes such foods as pasta, breads, cookies, and sugar-sweetened beverages.

In the study, the researchers analyzed the relationship between SGLT-1 mutations and cardiometabolic disease using genetic data obtained from 8,478 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study. The study was a 25-year-long observational trial of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors in people living in four U.S. communities.

The researchers found that about 6 percent of the subjects carried a mutation in SGLT-1 that causes limited impairment of glucose absorption. Individuals with this mutation had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, were less obese, had a lower incidence of heart failure, and had a lower mortality rate when compared to those without the mutation, even after adjusting for dietary intake (including total calories, sodium, and sugars).

Based on these findings, the scientists suggest that selectively blocking the SGLT-1 receptor could provide a way to slow down glucose uptake to prevent or treat cardiometabolic disease and its consequences. They caution that development of such targeted drugs could take years and that clinical trials are still needed to determine if the drugs reduce the incidence of diabetes and heart failure and improve lifespan.

The ARIC study is performed as a collaborative study supported by NHLBI contracts ((HHSN268201100005C, HHSN268201100006C, HHSN268201100007C, HHSN268201100008C, HHSN26820110000 9C, HHSN268201100010C, HHSN268201100011C, and HHSN26820 1100012C).

898,"
• New research suggests that legalizing cannabis at the federal level could help mitigate the sales of high-potency cannabis products, which may be harmful to overall health.
• Federal decriminalization would mean that states could each set their own cannabis laws, but some states may fail to set a limit on the amount of THC that can be included in products.
• According to experts, a universal THC cap on products across all states could be an effective solution. Federal legalization of cannabis would provide an opportunity to set regulations that better protect public health, researchers say. In a white paper published July 18, researchers at the University of Southern California’s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics outlined several potential policies that could be enacted by the federal government if it decriminalizes cannabis. This includes placing limits on the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — the main psychoactive compound in cannabis — that can be included in products, and restricting how much individuals can buy at one time based on the amount of THC in the product. Other policies include taxing cannabis products based on potency rather than weight or retail price and tracking all cannabis or hemp from cultivation to being sold as a product.

A published in The Lancet Psychiatry suggests that people who use higher-potency cannabis have a higher risk of developing cannabis use disorder. They are also more likely to experience a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. According to the USC white paper, other research has shown that legalizing cannabis at the state level is linked to an increase in cannabis-related visits to the emergency department by children and teens, and a rise in cannabis-involved impaired driving. “A public health approach to cannabis regulation is about incentivizing users in a manner that maximizes benefits and reduces harm,” Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, PhD, a senior fellow at the USC Schaeffer Center and Elizabeth Garrett Chair in Health Policy, Economics & Law at the USC Price School of Public Policy, told Healthline. Pacula added that a public health approach to how cannabis products are sold and developed is “mindful that higher levels of THC induce more impairment and more health risks.”

In the United States, cannabis is illegal at the federal level, although many states have passed laws allowing medical and/or recreational use of cannabis. A bill introduced in the U.S. Senate on July 21 would decriminalize cannabis at the federal level and allow states to set their own cannabis laws. Other bills in the House and Senate are in the works. While this may seem like a positive development for cannabis enthusiasts, Pacula expressed concern. “If the federal government legalizes cannabis without putting in a [THC] cap, we won’t ever get one,” she said. “The only states that have put potency caps in place have been the ones that did it when they first legalized cannabis.” Current state cannabis laws vary in terms of limits on purchase quantities and potency limits. For example, Vermont and Connecticut are the only states that have set THC potency limits for both cannabis flower and concentrates, according to USC researchers. Pacula said the limits set by these two states are “probably reasonable for the U.S. market, although they might still be too high. But I’m OK letting that be, as opposed to not setting a cap at all.” In addition, she and her colleagues point out that most states that limit cannabis sales do so based on product weight and type rather than the quantity of THC contained in the product. This allows people to buy a large amount of higher-potency cannabis products at one time.

The policies the USC researchers outline in the white paper would discourage excessive cannabis use, in particular the use of higher-THC products such as edibles and cannabis concentrates. “Right now [cannabis] flower is the main product being sold, but we are seeing a huge shift to vape oils concentrate, while edibles have stabilized in the market,” Pacula said. While the policies outlined in the white paper focused on the THC content of cannabis products, Liz Rogan, founder of The Cannabis Business Council of Santa Barbara County, said this misses the role that different components of cannabis may play in the intoxicating or other effects of these products. Pacula emphasized, however, that the standards would need to adapt as additional scientific data is available on the risks associated with different doses of THC. These policy updates could also take into account new science on the effects of other components of cannabis. “It took us decades to understand alcohol and what a standardized drink was,” Pacula said. “So we should set these caps and wait at least 5 years before we adjust them because it’s going to take some time for the science to come out.”

R. Lorraine Collins, PhD, professor and associate dean for research in the University at Buffalo’s School of Public Health and Health Professions, supports the white paper’s proposed policies. She said that setting THC limits for cannabis products and taxing products based on THC content would be easy to implement, calling these strategies an “excellent start.” For a THC cap to work to be effective, Collins said laws would need to cap the potency of all cannabis products, including ones that come directly from the cannabis plant and those that are derived from hemp or cannabis. “The cannabis industry is very smart,” she said. “One of the things that they do is if you say you’re going to cap the potency of cannabis flower, they’ll increase the potency in other cannabis products. So the key is to cap THC in ‘all cannabis products.'” In addition, she said the laws would need to be broad enough to cover cannabis products developed in the future. As for individual limits on cannabis purchases, Collins expressed some reservations about this policy since the U.S. doesn’t have similar limits for other adult-use products such as alcohol and tobacco. Rogan agreed: “This is an adult we’re talking about. This is somebody who should be able to make their own decisions,” she said. “It really goes back to personal choice — you have [the] freedom to do what you want; we’re hoping you’re going to be responsible.” In addition, Collins said that individual purchase limits may not be very effective. “What’s to stop a person from going from retail outlet to retail outlet?” she said. “You could accumulate a lot of cannabis that way, even if there’s a limit on how much you can buy at a time.” Rogan is also concerned about the impact that a cap on THC limits and purchase limits might have on people using cannabis to treat medical conditions. “When you’re treating cancer or chronic pain, you often need high doses of THC,” she said. “So is it fair to that person to have to go to the [cannabis] dispensary every day and buy more often because they can’t buy the products in a concentrated form?”

While states like Connecticut and Vermont have stricter caps on THC content, the USC researchers argue that federal regulation would ensure that public health is protected equally throughout the country. “You’re not going to incentivize good cannabis industry standards if you let states vary these caps,” Pacula said. “It’s going to be much easier to do it on a federal level.” A federal cap, she added, would only set the maximum potency for cannabis products. States could have more restrictive laws. In addition, there is now a precedent for the federal government to regulate the maximum THC content of cannabis products. “The FDA, which finally did get authorization to regulate nicotine products, is able to do things like set a cap on the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, or remove certain kind of flavors from tobacco,” Collins said. Collins noted that having different cannabis laws in each state — in particular THC caps — could lead to people in places with more restrictive laws shopping for cannabis in neighboring states with more lenient regulations. Something similar happened before all states set 21 years as the minimum drinking age for alcohol, she said. Still, Collins said that many people will be attracted to the legal cannabis market for what it offers — being able to buy products that are safe and contain exactly what they are supposed to. “You don’t have to worry about whether your weed is being cut with fentanyl or another drug that could do you harm,” she said. “You also don’t have to worry about poor cultivation leading to mold that could do you harm when you’re smoking cannabis.”

New research presents a compelling argument for regulating cannabis at the federal level. Decriminalizing cannabis could help limit the sales and use of high-potency cannabis products, which studies have shown pose dangers to human health. Even with federal legalization, however, experts like Collins and Rogan say that setting caps on THC could still drive consumers to buy higher-potency products in the illicit cannabis market. “If people are concerned about young people — especially males 26 and under — using high-THC products, the legal system is going to be better,” Rogan said. “Because at least they know what they’re getting there versus if they’re getting a product on some street corner.”",0

• He is fully vaccinated and currently taking Paxlovid.
• His press secretary said he has mild symptoms.

President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on the morning of July 21 and is experiencing “mild symptoms,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

As by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for someone of his age, the 79-year-old Biden has received two COVID-19 boosters.

“Because the president is fully vaccinated, double boosted, his risk of serious illness is dramatically lower,” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the White House COVID response coordinator, said at a briefing Thursday afternoon. “Our expectation is that he’s going to have mild illness.”

Biden first tested positive on Thursday morning with a rapid antigen test, as part of routine screening — later confirmed by a PCR test — and has started taking the antiviral Paxlovid.

This prescription medication is available through from the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in people 12 years and older who are at high risk of severe illness.

“Paxlovid … has been shown to retain excellent antiviral activity against the currently circulating Omicron variants,” said Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences.

However, he said in a small number of cases, people’s symptoms return, and/or they test positive again after completing the 5-day treatment.

Overall, though, the President’s “general good health … bodes well that he will make a full recovery,” said Siegel.

The President’s main symptoms are a runny nose and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started Wednesday evening, the President’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a letter.

These kinds of “mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [have] been more typical of the Omicron variant compared to previous COVID-19 variants that had more lower respiratory tract symptoms,” said Siegel.",0

907,"April 18, 2023 – YouTube announced today it will screen more eating disorder content to reduce the potential for dangerous copycat behavior. The video-based social media platform will also implement age-based viewing restrictions for some eating disorder content. In a statement, the director of YouTube Health, Garth Graham, MD, MPH, said the reason for the changes was “to create space for community, recovery and resources, while protecting viewers.” The changes were developed with input from the National Eating Disorder Association and other related groups. Lawmakers and advocates have called for social media companies to do more to protect people who may be sensitive to eating disorder content after the revelation that Meta officials knew in 2021 that its social media platform Instagram was influencing teens in concerning ways. The company’s own internal research found that Instagram caused 1 in 3 teen girls to feel worse about themselves, and that the platform could lead a 13-year-old girl seeking diet tips to instructional eating disorder content.

Up to 30 million people in the U.S. have eating disorders, which can be fatal. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates 2.7% of people experience an eating disorder by the time they turn 18. Considered mental illnesses, eating disorders can include dangerous behaviors such as restrictive eating, binge eating, and purging. YouTube says billions of people worldwide log into the platform per month, and that more than 500 hours of content are uploaded each minute of the day. YouTube already had policies for removing content that “glorified” or promoted eating disorders. Among the new policies is an additional ban of content about eating disorders that feature imitable behavior, which could include purging after eating, severely restricting calories, or weight-based bullying “in the context of eating disorders.” For some content about eating disorders that is not blocked, YouTube may implement age-based viewing restrictions or add a “crisis resource panel,” which lets people connect with live support from a YouTube partner. Age-based restrictions would apply to viewers under 18 years old and could also be triggered when someone is not signed into YouTube. “We developed this age restriction approach for eating disorder-related videos in consultation with third-party experts to strike the right balance in our continuing efforts to protect younger viewers from content they may be more susceptible to imitating than adults,” Graham said, adding that the changes will be implemented gradually.",0
908,"Researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have made a discovery linking lupus, a potentially debilitating autoimmune disorder, and macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness.

The two diseases share a common contributor to harmful inflammation, the scientists found. The insights could let researchers develop new treatments for those diseases and other conditions driven by the newly discovered inflammation source.

""We were quite surprised at the common link between lupus and macular degeneration,"" said Jayakrishna Ambati, MD, of UVA's Department of Ophthalmology and the founding director of UVA's Center for Advanced Vision Science. ""It appears that the new inflammatory pathway we identified could be therapeutically targeted for many chronic diseases.""

Ambati and his collaborators have discovered an unknown role for an inflammasome -- an agent of the immune system -- called NLRC4-NLRP3. Inflammasomes play an important role in marshaling the body's defenses to protect it from invaders such as viruses and bacteria.

In lupus and atrophic macular degeneration, however, it appears that NLRC4-NLRP3 contributes to harmful inflammation, the UVA researchers found. In lupus, it helps drive the hyperactive immune response that leads to symptoms such as joint pain, rash, fever and more. In macular degeneration, meanwhile, NRC4-NLRP3 appears to contribute to inflammation that destroys the vital light-sensing cells in the eye's retina.

Ambati's new work helps explain why. The inflammasome, he found, is sent into action by a special class of genetic material called ""short interspersed nuclear element RNAs,"" or SINE RNAs. This type of RNA makes up more than 10% of our genomes, and it activates in response to cell stresses such as infection, genetic damage and aging. The resulting inflammation caused by SINE RNAs can be harmful in many chronic diseases.

SINE RNAs are elevated in both macular degeneration and lupus, Ambati found. In addition to discovering the role of SINE RNA in the two diseases, Ambati and his colleagues identified an unknown receptor for the SINE RNAs called DDX17. Scientists have been looking for this receptor for decades, and the new discovery helps them better understand the process that leads to the harmful inflammation.

""These findings indicate that blocking a single inflammasome might not be enough, and that targeting both the NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes would be a superior strategy,"" Ambati said.

Using this new information, scientists may be able to target the source of harmful inflammation in lupus, macular degeneration and other diseases driven by SINE RNAs. That could lead to new treatments to benefit patients, the UVA researchers say.

""We're excited to have developed drugs called Kamuvudines that block this dual inflammasome, which we anticipate will be in clinical trials next year,"" Ambati said.",0
909,"Oct. 28, 2022 – The number of tuberculosis cases and deaths in 2021 increased from the previous year as the COVID pandemic disrupted medical services globally, the World Health Organization says. About 10.6 million people fell ill with TB in 2021, a 4.5% increase from 2020, according to the WHO’s Global TB Report 2022. The number of people dying from TB rose to 1.6 million in 2021, compared to 1.5 million in 2020. The number of drug-resistant TB cases went up 3%. This is the first time the number of TB cases and drug-resistant TB cases has gone up in a number of years, the WHO said in a news release. “TB services are among many others disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, but its impact on the TB response has been particularly severe,” the news release said. “Ongoing conflicts across Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East have further exacerbated the situation for vulnerable populations.”

TB is a contagious infection that usually attacks the lungs. After COVID-19, it’s the world’s deadliest infectious killer, the WHO says. The difficulty in receiving medical treatment during the pandemic meant many people were not diagnosed with TB and not treated for the illness, the WHO said. In 2019, before the pandemic, 7.1 million new cases were diagnosed. That number fell to 5.8 million in 2020 but rebounded slightly to 6.4 million in 2021. The report noted several small gains. Preventive TB treatment for people living with HIV reached more than 10 million people from 2018 to 2021, exceeding the global target of 6 million people. (People with HIV are highly susceptible to TB.) Most TB cases reported in 2021 occurred in “high burden” nations in the WHO regions of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific. WHO officials said health organizations need to make TB prevention a high priority again. “The report provides important new evidence and makes a strong case on the need to join forces and urgently redouble efforts to get the TB response back-on-track to reach TB targets and save lives,” Tereza Kasaeva, MD, director of the WHO’s Global TB Program, said in a statement.",0
910,"WEDNESDAY, March 1, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- For decades, people turned to cigarettes in times of stress. Now, a preliminary study hints that young people are using vaping in the same way. The study, of nearly 2,000 U.S. teenagers and young adults, found that those who vaped nicotine or marijuana were more likely to report anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts. In fact, a majority of vapers said they'd suffered anxiety or depression symptoms in the past week, while over half had contemplated suicide in the past year. ""One of the challenges is in teasing out the cause and effect,"" said Loren Wold, a professor in the Colleges of Nursing and Medicine at Ohio State University. Many of the young people surveyed explicitly said they'd started vaping to deal with depression -- including one-third of those who vaped marijuana.

 That's worrying, Wold said, since no one would consider vaping a healthy coping strategy. Wold, who was not involved in the study, was lead author on a recent report from the American Heart Association (AHA) on the physical health consequences of vaping during adolescence. There's still a lot to learn, as vaping is a relatively new phenomenon, Wold said. But it's clear there are shorter-term effects, including inflammation in the airways, blood pressure spikes and increased stiffness in the arteries. So young people who vape could be ""setting themselves up for heart and lung disease,"" Wold said. What's ""intriguing"" about the new findings, he said, is that they link vaping to mental health. The research is to be presented at an AHA meeting in Boston. Studies released at meetings are generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. But the results are the latest in a line of work raising concerns about the ""epidemic"" of vaping among young Americans. In 2022, over 2.5 million U.S. kids reported vaping, according to the nonprofit Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. And many were not just experimenting: Almost half of high school students who vaped said they did it on most days.

Vaping devices work by heating a liquid that produces a ""vapor,"" allowing users to inhale nicotine or THC (the active ingredient in marijuana). But while vaping does not involve smoke, it's not benign. Kids are still getting hooked on nicotine, and being hit with the harms of that drug (or THC), which can include effects on brain development. Plus, Wold said, the liquids in vaping devices do not -- contrary to popular belief -- produce ""harmless water vapor."" When heated, those liquids actually churn out over 1,000 chemicals, he said. Whether those exposures can directly affect kids' mental health is not yet known. The new findings are based on an online survey of 1,921 teens and young adults, ages 13 to 24. A majority said they had vaped in the past month, including 830 who said they'd vaped both nicotine and THC. Overall, 70% of THC-only vapers said they'd had anxiety issues in the past week, as did over 60% of those who vaped nicotine or both drugs. That compared with around 40% of participants who'd never vaped. Meanwhile, over half of all vapers had struggled with depression symptoms in the past week, versus one-quarter of nonvapers. Some -- 20% to one-third -- said depression had driven them to try vaping. It's not clear why they thought it might help, but Wold said he suspects industry marketing is partly to blame: Kids are regularly exposed to vaping images and messaging on social media, in ways that portray it as ""cool"" or a way to enjoy life. Dr. Rose Marie Robertson, deputy chief science and medical officer for the AHA, is the senior researcher on the study. She pointed to the ""broad view"" -- the fact that kids today are distressed by many things, from violence to the divisiveness in civil discourse. And they need help in dealing with that, so they do not turn to substances, she said. When it comes to vaping itself, Robertson said the problem needs to be tackled from various angles. One is regulation. ""We advocate for public policies that we have data to demonstrate will help prevent kids from taking up vaping -- things like eliminating flavored tobacco products,"" Robertson said. ""Flavors are a big part of the reason that many kids begin to vape.""",0

912,"July 28, 2022 – COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are increasing again as the very contagious BA.5 variant spreads across the country, with nearly 500 deaths reported each day. After 2 months of daily death numbers rarely climbing above 400, the average has recently grown to about 450 deaths per day, according to NPR. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and intensive care numbers have also risen in recent weeks, reaching the highest points of the summer. Although most people aren’t getting a severe disease, some are “still getting quite sick from it,” Ashish Jha, MD, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, told NPR. “If you look at who’s getting sick, who’s really ending up in the hospital, who’s ending up in the ICU, who’s dying – unfortunately, it’s people who are either not vaccinated or not up to date on their vaccines,” he said. “People who are not fully boosted, or double boosted if they’re older, people who have not gotten treatments. We have to continue working hard to make sure that Americans get vaccinated, get their immunity up, get treatments.”

More than 130,000 new coronavirus cases are being reported each day, according to the data tracker from The New York Times. All but a few states have seen steady increases during the past 2 weeks. Public health experts have said the official case tallies are considered a significant undercount because many people have chosen to use at-home tests or not test at all. The BA.5 Omicron subvariant accounts for 82% of new cases in the U.S., according to the latest CDC data. Other Omicron subvariants make up the rest of the cases, with 13% from BA.4, 5% from BA.2.12.1, and less than 1% from BA.2. Hospitalizations have been steadily increasing, with nearly 45,000 COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the country, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About 4,800 patients are in intensive care units. The trends vary across the country. In California, which is reporting the highest number of cases with nearly 20,000 per day, case counts are at the highest point in nearly 6 months, the Times reported. Georgia, which is reporting nearly 7,000 cases per day, has the most cases per 100,000 residents. Missouri has a test positivity of 37%. In New York, more COVID-19 patients are hospitalized now than at the height of the Delta surge last year, the newspaper reported.

914,"A new study finds forensics researchers use terms related to ancestry and race in inconsistent ways, and calls for the discipline to adopt a new approach to better account for both the fluidity of populations and how historical events have shaped our skeletal characteristics.

""Forensic anthropology is a science, and we need to use terms consistently,"" says Ann Ross, corresponding author of the study and a professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University. ""Our study both highlights our discipline's challenges in discussing issues of ancestral origin consistently, and suggests that focusing on population affinity would be a way forward.""

Race is a social construct -- there's no scientific basis for it. Population affinity, in the context of forensic anthropology, is determined by the skeletal characteristics associated with groups of people. Those characteristics are shaped by historic events and forces such as gene flow, migration, and so on. What's more, these population groups can be very fluid.

In practical terms, that this means that race can be wildly misleading in a forensic context. For example, a missing person may have been listed as Black on their driver's license because of their skin color. But their skeletal remains may not indicate they were of African descent, because their bone structure may reflect other aspects of their ancestry.

""Like many disciplines, forensic anthropology has been coming to terms with issues regarding race,"" Ross says. ""Some people in the discipline want to do away completely with assessing an individual's place of origin. Others say that conventional approaches still have value in helping to identify human remains.

""In this paper, we are recommending a third path. This study is focused on finding ways to evaluate human variation that give us valuable information in forensic and anthropological contexts, but that avoid clinging to the use of outdated defaults such as race.""

In one part of the study, the researchers looked at all of the papers published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences between 2009 and 2019 that referenced ancestry, race or related terms. The goal of this content analysis was to determine if the terms were being used consistently within the field. And they were not.

""The Journal of Forensic Sciences is the flagship journal for forensic sciences in the U.S., and even there we found inconsistencies in how our field uses these terms,"" Ross says. ""Inconsistent terminology opens the door to confusion, misunderstanding and misuse within the discipline.""

In a second part of the study, the researchers used geometric morphometric data and spatial analysis methods to evaluate the validity of terms such as ""European"" or ""African"" to describe the ancestral origin of human remains.

Altogether, the researchers evaluated nine datasets, comprising data on 397 people. The datasets were of human remains collected in Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Panama, Puerto Rico, Peru, Spain and a population of enslaved Africans that had been buried in Cuba. All of the remains, except for those of the enslaved Africans, were from the 20th or 21st centuries.

""Regarding the data we have on the remains of enslaved Africans, we want to acknowledge the value that data collected from such samples can contribute to discussions of human variation, while also noting that the history and ethics of human skeletal collections, in general, is often dubious,"" Ross says. ""Such body harvesting all too often occurred under the umbrella of scientific racism, without the permission of the deceased or next of kin, and disproportionately targeted marginalized populations.""

In their review of recent papers, the researchers found that forensics experts often still referred to remains as being of African, Asian or European origin.

""But our analysis of these nine datasets shows that this approach is wrong, because it's not that simple,"" Ross says.

""Let's use Panama as an example,"" says Ross, who is from Panama. ""There have been huge movements of people into this area from all over the world over the past 500 years: indigenous peoples who predate colonialism, colonizers from Europe, slaves from Africa, immigrants from Asia. The contemporary remains we see in Panama reflect all of those influences.""

Ross also noted that the analysis of the nine datasets also highlighted a flaw in the contemporary idea of ""clines."" The idea of clines is basically that, while there are changes from one group of people to another, populations who are geographically close to each other are more similar than populations that are geographically distant. However, the researchers found that this assumption can be misleading.

For example, Panama and Colombia share a border, but very different historical forces have acted on Panama and Colombia in recent centuries -- so the skeletal characteristics of remains from those two countries are much less similar than one would anticipate.

""All of this is important for multiple reasons, such as taking meaningful steps to reduce racism in our field, and ensuring that we are communicating clearly with each other within the discipline,"" Ross says. ""It is also important because marginalized people are most often the people whose remains go unidentified. Labeling them as 'Hispanic' or 'Black' is misleading. We, as forensic anthropologists, need to change the way we think about origin. We need to begin thinking about physical markers in the context of population affinity and how we can use that to both communicate clearly and to help understand who we are seeing when we work with unidentified remains. We need to ensure that we are not contributing -- even inadvertently -- to structural inequities and racism.

""This also means that we are faced with a wide range of new research questions. As a field, much of our work has focused on looking at data from the remains of historic populations. I think we need to begin doing more work that can help us better understand the ways in which historical events have helped to shape the skeletal characteristics of modern populations.""",0
915,"Aug. 12, 2022 – The United States has now recorded more than 10,000 confirmed monkeypox cases, according to data released by the CDC. The U.S. passed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday, with the number climbing to 10,768 by Friday morning, according to the latest CDC data. Monkeypox cases have been found in every state except Wyoming. New York (2,187), California (1,892), and Florida (1,053) have reported the most cases. So far, no monkeypox deaths have been reported in the U.S. The numbers are increasing, with 1,391 cases reported in the U.S. on Wednesday alone, by far the most in 1 day since the current outbreak began.

The smallpox-like disease was first found in humans in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970 and has become more common in West and Central Africa. It began spreading to European and other Western nations in May 2022. The WHO declared it a global public health emergency in late July, and the Biden administration declared it a national health emergency Aug. 4. To fight the spread of monkeypox, the Biden administration is buying $26 million worth of SIGA Technologies Inc.’s IV version of the antiviral drug TPOXX, the company announced Tuesday. U.S. health officials also modified monkeypox vaccine dosing instructions to stretch the supply of vaccine.

921,"Limited data on the uptake of contraception prior to and during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic could mean unforeseen issues for sexual and reproductive health services, research from the University of Warwick concludes.

It identifies additional barriers that women faced in accessing contraception during the Covid-19 lockdown, including disruption to sexual health services and fears about contracting the virus, as well as a pressing need to ensure that access to contraception is maintained to avoid the health and social impacts of unplanned pregnancies beyond the pandemic.

The research, published in the European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care, is a scoping review of existing research into the impact of disasters on contraception in higher income countries such as the United Kingdom to assist in disaster response planning. It aims to establish existing knowledge from previous disasters and epidemics, with a significant focus on the Covid-19 pandemic.

Previous research has shown that disasters are associated with increased rates of early pregnancy loss, stillbirth and premature birth, as well as with increased birth rates. However, until now there has not been a review of how the uptake of contraception is affected, and what impact this may have on women's reproductive health.

Policies on accessing contraception vary by country and include access to:

In the United Kingdom contraception is free through the NHS but requires a prescription. However, the Covid-19 pandemic created new barriers that may have prevented women from accessing contraception. They might avoid going to a healthcare provider due to the fear of contracting Covid-19, or concerns about travelling, especially if relying on public transport.

However, the research highlighted examples of good practice in overcoming these barriers, such as drive-through or kerbside provision of contraception. Some health providers were able to maintain access to contraception using telehealth (i.e. video or phone consultations), however these presented safeguarding and privacy issues. Evidence from outside the UK also showed that making emergency contraception prescription-free rather than cost-free has a greater impact on unplanned pregnancies.

As data were not collected on the uptake of contraception prior to the pandemic, it is unclear how successful these methods have been, nor how women's access to contraception has been affected. The researchers recommend collecting more data on the uptake of contraception, awareness of the benefits and pitfalls of telehealth methods, and a move to making more contraception prescription-free, as is currently being considered for the progestogen-only pills.

Co-author Dr Julia Gauly from Warwick Medical School said: ""We don't have a clear picture of how the uptake of contraception changes during disasters or the Covid-19 pandemic, because we don't have enough data from before, during and after the crisis to compare. Collecting better data would put us in a better position in the future to predict things like birth rates.

""It's important that women can access contraception and have a choice, especially during disasters. Many people lost their jobs during the pandemic or they became sick with Covid, so the needs of women for contraception may have changed. Someone who was planning to start a family might change their mind during a crisis or pandemic, due to financial or health reasons. So it's important that women and their partners have a choice in their family planning.""",0

924,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Patients, including the late actor/playwright Sam Shepard, become progressively weaker and eventually paralyzed as their motor neurons degenerate and die.

To find a cure for ALS, which is fatal, scientists need a deeper understanding of how it interrupts motor neuron communication channels. Because motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord, and from the spinal cord to the muscles, when they die, the brain can no longer initiate muscle movement.

Yuyu Song of Harvard Medical School was a Grass Fellow at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, when she took advantage of a powerful research organism in neuroscience, the local squid, to start asking how a mutant protein associated with familial ALS behaves under controlled conditions.

Her study, recently published in eNeuro, clarifies the mechanisms underlying neural dysfunction in ALS, and also suggests a novel approach to restoring the health of motor neurons in patients with the disease.

Song focused on how this mutant protein, called G85R-SOD1, affects neurotransmission at the squid ""giant synapse,"" the junction where neurons transmit chemical signals to muscle fibers, causing the muscle to contract.

The squid giant synapse is one of the few mature nervous systems that mimics human neuromuscular junctions, while allowing precise experimental manipulations and live measurements.

Song showed that the presence of misfolded mutant SOD1 inhibits synaptic transmission and diminishes the pool of synaptic vesicles, whose job is to deliver neurotransmitters critical for neuronal connections.

Surprisingly, synaptic function was restored by intermittent, high-frequency stimulation, which suggested aberrant calcium signaling may underlie SOD1 toxicity to normal synaptic transmission.

To test this hypothesis, Song used calcium imaging to capture the abnormal calcium influx in the presynaptic terminal and confirmed the protective role of a calcium chelator, which corrected the calcium imbalance without affecting neurotransmission.

This suggests a new approach to therapeutic intervention for ALS, in which chemical or electrical regulation of calcium and its downstream signaling pathways may restore the health of motor neurons.

""Altogether, our results not only demonstrated synaptic dysfunction related to ALS and its underlying molecular pathways, but also extended our understanding of fundamental synaptic physiology,"" Song says.",0

931,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Medical doctors in the United States are twice as likely to experience symptoms of burnout as other workers, which can compromise quality of care and place patients at risk. In a study in JAMA Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic researchers suggest a new approach to fighting burnout: external professional coaching.

Defined by the World Health Organization as “feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy,” burnout creates problems for both physicians and the patients they treat. This study, led by Liselotte Dyrbye, M.D. and Colin West, M.D., Ph.D., investigates the use of external professional coaching—focused on professional goal setting, work choices, professional relationships, and influencing change at work—to reduce burnout. Though researchers have previously studied coaching in other contexts, this is the first study specifically exploring its effects on physician burnout.

“Helping physicians navigate career decisions and manage the stress of their job is crucial,” says Dr. Dyrbye. “While many of these doctors have a good informal support system, professional coaches can address a variety of topics and needs, and provide a safe setting to admit perceived vulnerabilities and uncertainties. We really think it can improve physicians’ ability to manage their careers and change the detrimental aspects of their work environments, so that ultimately they can do their job well without feeling overwhelmed.”

Participants – 88 practicing physicians – began the study by filling out several self-assessment questionnaires, querying for burnout, quality of life, resilience, and job satisfaction. They then completed 6 sessions with a non-physician credentialed professional coach, who worked with the doctors on issues of their choice. After those six sessions, the physicians filled out the same questionnaires to chart their progress.

Results were promising. The doctors reported less burnout and a higher quality of life after coaching, as compared to before. Notably, the researchers also administered these tests on physicians who were not coached. Across the same span of time, these physicians actually reported more emotional exhaustion and lower quality of life, showing how these symptoms can worsen if left unaddressed.

More research remains to be done on the efficacy of professional coaching when combined with other programs, but these results suggest it may be added to a growing list of evidence-based tools to support physicians and, by extension, the patients they serve. While useful, professional coaching should be offered in parallel to organizational efforts to improve the practice environment and address the underlying drivers of burnout among physicians.

Additional coauthors of the study are Priscilla Gill, Ed.D., and Daniel Satele, of Mayo Clinic; and Tait Shanafelt, M.D., Stanford University. The study was funded by the Physicians Foundation and Mayo Clinic.

933,"A new study, published in Science Translational Medicine by researchers at the University of Oxford has identified that Talarozole, a drug that is known to increase retinoic acid, was able to prevent osteoarthritis (OA) in disease models.

Tonia Vincent, Professor of Musculoskeletal Biology & Honorary Rheumatologist at Oxford's Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), said: 'Hand osteoarthritis is a common and debilitating medical condition that affects mainly women, especially around the time of the menopause. We currently have no effective treatments that modify their disease.'

The researchers started by investigating a common gene variant that had been linked to severe hand OA. Using patient samples collected at the time of routine hand surgery, as well as a number of experimental models, they were able to identify a key molecule that was especially low in 'at risk' individuals, called retinoic acid.

More than 40% of individuals will develop osteoarthritis (OA) during their lifetime. Hand (OA) is an extremely common form of OA and there are currently no disease modifying treatments that effectively relieve symptoms or stop deformity and stiffness of the joints.

Professor Vincent added: 'This project was only possible because of the multi-disciplinary approach that we took; working with our hand surgical colleagues, geneticists, data scientists and biologists.'

As talarozole has an acceptable safety profile in human subjects, a small proof of concept clinical study is underway to see whether this drug might represent a new disease modifying treatment in patients.

Dr Neha Issar-Brown, Director of Research and Health Intelligence at the charity Versus Arthritis, which funded the research, said: 'Around 8.5 million people in the UK live with OA. Despite often being dismissed as just a few aches and pains, OA can have a profound and far-reaching impact on life, affecting people's ability to work, care for a family, or live independently.

'There is an urgent need for disease-modifying treatments designed to prevent or reverse the painful symptoms of OA. This study reveals a new understanding of the causes of hand osteoarthritis, which could lead to identifying new biological targets for intervention in hand OA.

'This research is still at an early stage, but with these encouraging findings we are a big step closer in being able to develop a new class of disease-modifying drugs to treat osteoarthritis, prevent chronic pain, and enable people to live well with the condition,' Dr Issar-Brown concludes.",0

935,"New research showing high infant mortality rates are contributing to an incessant rise of the global human population supports arguments for greater access to contraception and family planning in low- and middle-income nations.

In an article published in PLOS ONE, research led by Professor Corey Bradshaw, Matthew Flinders Professor of Global Ecology from Flinders University and Peter Le Souëf, Professor of Paediatrics from The University of Western Australia has found that with higher baby death rates and larger household sizes (as an indicator of population density), fertility rates are higher.

In the first study of its kind, Professor Bradshaw, says it provides a compelling argument that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for reducing infant mortality can be accelerated by increasing access to family planning.

""Although it sounds counterintuitive, higher baby death rates are linked to higher population growth because the more babies a women loses, the more children she is likely to have. Family planning, including access to quality contraception, enables women to plan pregnancies better and therefore reduce infant mortality to curb the so-called 'replacement', or 'insurance' effect,"" Professor Bradshaw says.

""We evaluated six conditions thought to influence a woman's fertility -- availability of family planning, quality of family planning, education, religion, mortality, and socio-economic conditions, across 64 low- to middle-income countries.""
• increasing the availability of family planning is associated with reduced fertility;
• increasing the quality of family-planning services is associated with reduced fertility;
• increasing years of female education is associated with reducing fertility;
• increased fertility is observed in countries with a higher prevalence of adherents of Catholicism or Islam, two main religions that expressly dictate elements of fertility and/or family structure;
• a larger mean household size is positively correlated with fertility, and lower socio-economic conditions; and
• higher mortality (both infant and maternal) is associated with higher fertility.

Co-author Dr Melinda Judge from The University of Western Australia's Medical School says, ""Keeping babies alive actually reduced average fertility and helps put the brakes on population growth. Essentially, higher infant mortality and a larger household size increased fertility, whereas greater access to any form of contraception decreased fertility.""

""Interestingly, female education, home visits by health workers, quality of family planning services, and religious adherence all had weak, if any, contribution at the scale of entire countries.""

Professor Bradshaw says the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 (good health and wellbeing) and 5 (gender equality) emphasise the basic right to exercise control over sexual and reproductive health through universal access to family planning.

The world is not on track to meet Goal 3 to reduce global maternal mortality to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030.

""Our results show the best pathway toward reaching these targets is by providing readily available and high-quality family-planning services. These actions will not only to decrease fertility rates, they will also to lower the number of unintended pregnancies, infant deaths, and maternal deaths.

""These findings support the notion that to encourage continued declines in global fertility, both infant survival rates plus access to contraception need to be increased,"" explains Professor Bradshaw.

Co-author Chitra Saraswati also of The University of Western Australia's Medical School says, ""Recommendations for measures to decrease infant mortality emphasise improving the quality of antenatal care, increasing the number of trained healthcare staff at births, and improving postnatal care for both infants and mothers. Given the evidence that large households can worsen child health, improving living conditions to ameliorate high-density living could also indirectly result in lower fertility.""

""Allowing parents to choose family planning by providing readily available, modern methods of contraception can be expected to improve infant survival as well as reduce maternal mortality. This is because parents can plan and space their births, and being able to decide to have fewer children also has the potential to facilitate better investment in the overall health and well-being of families. It emphasises the importance of providing access to contraception as a direct contribution to decreasing infant mortality.""

""If we don't act now to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, fertility will rise, more children will die, and more women will succumb to birth-related deaths,"" Professor Bradshaw concludes.",0

943,"NIH-funded studies show stents and surgery no better than medication, lifestyle changes at reducing cardiac events

Researchers find stents, surgery provide higher quality of life for those with chest pain.

Invasive procedures such as bypass surgery and stenting—commonly used to treat blocked arteries—are no better at reducing the risk for heart attack and death in patients with stable ischemic heart disease than medication and lifestyle changes alone. However, such procedures offer better symptom relief and quality of life for some patients with chest pain, according to two new, milestone studies.

The studies, designed to settle a decades-old controversy in cardiology, appear online March 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine. While researchers released preliminary findings last November at the American Heart Association annual meeting, the papers published today report the official outcomes of the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), the largest and one of the most consequential studies of its kind.

Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health, the trial followed more than 5,000 patients with stable heart disease and moderate to severe heart disease for a median of 3.2 years. It compared an initial conservative treatment strategy to an invasive treatment strategy. The conservative treatment strategy involved medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol, and angina (chest discomfort caused by inadequate blood to the heart), along with counseling about diet and exercise. The invasive treatment strategy involved medications and counseling, as well as coronary procedures performed soon after patients recorded an abnormal stress test. The trial allowed tests that assess coronary blood flow restriction, called ischemia, to determine who could participate in the study.

“Previous studies have reached similar conclusions as ISCHEMIA, but they were criticized for not including patients who had severe enough disease to benefit from the procedures. ISCHEMIA studied only patients with the most abnormal stress tests,” said Yves Rosenberg, M.D., study co-author and chief of NHLBI’s Atherothrombosis and Coronary Artery Disease Branch. “These findings should be applied in the context of careful attention to lifestyle behaviors and guideline-based adherence to medical therapy, and will likely change clinical guidelines and influence clinical practice.”

He cautioned patients in the meantime to confer with their doctors to determine what strategies are best for them.

Coronary artery disease, which is caused by narrowed arteries that reduce blood to the heart, is the most common type of heart disease. It affects about 18 million Americans and is the leading cause of death in the United States. Symptoms can vary, but some people do not have them at all and may not know they have heart disease until they experience chest pain, a heart attack, or sudden cardiac arrest.

To find out whether an invasive or conservative strategy would be more effective in reducing these kinds of events, researchers studied the impact of both on heart attack, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and cardiovascular death. An additional key outcome of study was quality of life.

From August 2012 to January 2018, ISCHEMIA enrolled 5,179 patients who were an average of 64 years old, at 320 sites in 37 countries. Most participants had a history of chest pain, with 21% reporting daily or weekly chest pain. About 35% had no chest pain one month prior to enrollment.

The patients then were randomly assigned to receive either the conservative, medical therapy alone (unless their symptoms worsened), or medical therapy and an invasive intervention soon after having an abnormal stress test. Over the five years of the trial, 21% of patients in the conservative treatment group ended up having a stent implant or bypass surgery; the rest continued medication alone. Of those in the intervention group, revascularization was performed in 79%, three-quarters of them receiving stents and the others, bypass surgery.

By the end of the trial, the death rate between the two groups proved to be essentially the same: among the participants who had invasive procedures, 145 died, compared to 144 who received medication alone. The overall rate of disease-related events was similar among those who took medication alone: 352 experienced an event such as heart attack, compared to 318 who had invasive procedures.

Researchers noted one caveat; patients in the conservative strategy had fewer cardiovascular events during the first two years of the study. However, the invasive strategy patients had fewer events during the last two years, researchers noted, because of an uptick in heart attacks in that group in the first six months.

“We have known and confirmed in this study that stent and surgical procedures have a risk of some heart damage,” said Judith Hochman, M.D., study chair, co-lead author and Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Sciences NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “However, we saw that the heart damage related to a procedure was not as serious in terms of the risk of subsequent death compared to heart attacks that occurred spontaneously, unrelated to any procedure.”

The long-term follow-up of patients will be needed to better determine the true difference in prognosis between these two group.

For patients with angina, or chest pain, the comparative benefits of an invasive procedure over medical therapy alone were more consistent throughout the trial.

“ISCHEMIA showed an impressive, sustainable improvement in patients’ symptoms, function and quality of life with an invasive strategy for up to four years of follow-up,” said John Spertus, M.D., M.P.H., director of health outcomes research at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, MO., and co-principal investigator for the ISCHEMIA quality of life analysis. “However, this benefit was only observed in roughly two-thirds of those who had angina at baseline and no benefit was seen in those who had no symptoms.”

“Taken together, the quality of life and clinical results suggest that there is no need for invasive procedures in patients without symptoms,” said David Maron, M.D., director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center at Stanford University and the study’s lead author and principal investigator. “For those with angina, our results show it is just as safe to begin treating with medication and lifestyle change, and then if symptoms persist, discuss invasive treatment options.”

Two other ISCHEMIA companion studies produced other key results. ISCHEMIA-Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and quality of life studies, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, did not show a reduced risk for death and heart attack for participants who had advanced chronic kidney disease, stable coronary disease, as well as moderate or severe ischemia with the invasive treatment compared to the conservative treatment. There were no benefits in quality of life, even if participants had angina symptoms.

944,"July 31, 2022 -- The Biden administration plans to begin a COVID-19 booster campaign with reformulated vaccines in September, according to The New York Times.

With the new shots on the way, federal officials have decided not to expand eligibility for second boosters of the existing vaccines for those under 50 this summer. The new boosters are expected to provide better protection against the Omicron subvariants, including BA.5.

For now, only adults over age 50 and those over age 12 with immune deficiencies are eligible for second booster doses of the current vaccines. FDA officials debated last week whether to open eligibility now as the BA.5 subvariant drives up coronavirus cases across the country. But they decided to wait to boost immunity in September to protect against a potential winter surge.

945,"NIH-funded study suggests that slight changes in a brain’s wiring can greatly change behavior.

According to a new National Institutes of Health-funded study, it is not destiny that brings two fruit flies together, but an evolutionary matchmaker of sorts that made tiny adjustments to their brains’ mating circuits, so they would be attracted to one another while rejecting advances from other, even closely-related, species. The results, published in Nature, may help explain how a specific female scent triggers completely different responses in different male flies.

“This study reveals how a very small tweak in brain wiring can result in large changes in very complex social behaviors, which can ultimately determine the fate of a species,” said Jim Gnadt, Ph.D., program director at the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which supported the study. “Understanding how variation in brain circuits leads to changes in behavior is one of the primary goals of the NIH’s BRAIN Initiative and this study provides a piece of the puzzle.”

Vanessa Ruta, Ph.D., professor at Rockefeller University in New York City, and her colleagues used cutting-edge genetic tools to compare the brain circuits behind courtship behavior in two closely related species of fruit fly, D. melanogaster and D. simulans.

Previous studies showed that although males from both species could detect a specific pheromone, or scent, called 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), their reactions to it were very different. Male D. melanogaster flies found it attractive while D. simulans males avoided females that carried it. In this study, Dr. Ruta and her team discovered that slight differences in the way the fly’s brains are wired may control these opposite reactions.

“From a fly’s perspective, courtship is the most important decision it will make, and so evolutionary processes have really fine-tuned their brains to ensure optimal behaviors, leading them to their ideal mates,” said Dr. Ruta.

In fruit flies, pheromones are detected by sensory neurons on the legs, and that information travels to P1 neurons that sit in the lateral protocerebral complex (LPC) in the brain. In between the sensory and P1 neurons, the wiring splits so that the P1 cells can be either turned on or off.

P1 neurons trigger courtship activity in D. melanogaster males but have not been studied in other fly species. When the P1 neurons were turned on in D. simulans males, they tried mating with nearby objects including unsuitable targets such as females from different species as well as rotating magnets. This suggests that P1 neurons may be important for sparking courtship behaviors across species.

Dr. Ruta and her team used state-of-the-art technology to watch brain cells light up in real time as male flies were exposed to D. melanogaster and D. simulans females releasing 7,11-HD. When D. melanogaster males were exposed to females from their species, there was a lot of activity by the P1 neurons. Exposure to D. simulans females did not turn on those neurons. However, P1 neurons in the D. simulans males did not light up when they were exposed to females from their species, suggesting that differences in P1 neurons may underlie species-specific responses to 7,11-HD.

Additional experiments suggested that as pheromone signals traveled from the legs to P1 neurons, that information was conveyed differently in the two species of fruit fly by brain cells that communicate directly with P1 neurons. Specifically, P1 neurons appeared to receive lots of excitation in D. melanogaster flies but got more calming signals in D. simulans flies, which led to opposite responses when the animals were exposed to 7,11-HD. These findings also suggested that in some species of flies, absence of pheromone signaling may be more attractive than the presence of certain scents.

Future experiments will look at similar behaviors in other species of fruit flies. More research is needed to learn the mechanisms that drive evolutionary changes in brain circuitry, which may have important consequences for individual and social behavior.

947,"Nov. 10, 2022 – A mysterious new listeria outbreak that's killed one person, caused one pregnancy loss, and hospitalized 13 people across six states is suspected to be linked to deli meats and cheeses, U.S. health officials said. The FDA is still investigating the outbreak and has not yet determined its exact source, but health officials suspect deli meat and cheese and are urging caution to vulnerable groups considering eating those foods. “It is difficult for investigators to identify a single food as the source of outbreaks linked to deli meats and cheeses,” the CDC explained in a news release. “This is because Listeria spreads easily between food and the deli environment and can persist for a long time in deli display cases and on equipment.” The warning includes deli-sold products such as cold cuts, hot dogs, pâtés, and cheeses. Sixteen people have been sickened across California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. The person who died lived in Maryland.

The CDC says the outbreak is likely much larger because most people who come into contact with listeria will not need medical care so they won’t be tested. “The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC explained alongside a map showing current case counts. People are at a higher risk of listeria illness if they are pregnant, have a weakened immune system, or are age 65 or older, the CDC news release warned. “If you are in any of these groups, do not eat meat or cheese from any deli counter unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or until steaming hot,” the CDC advised. People in these groups who have kept deli meat or cheese at home recently should clean their refrigerator, health officials advised. Listeria is caused by a bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. People can get sick when they eat food that's been contaminated with the bacteria. Symptoms of listeria illness usually start within 2 weeks but can also appear up to 10 weeks later. Symptoms in people who are not pregnant include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions, fever, or muscle aches. Pregnant people usually experience fewer symptoms – just fever, fatigue, and muscle aches – and the illness is extremely dangerous, potentially causing pregnancy loss.",0

955,"Dec. 18, 2022 – The percentage of people in the U.S. getting the latest COVID-19 booster shot has crept up by single digits in the past couple months, despite health officials pleading for people to do so before the Christmas holiday. Now, a new poll shows why so few people are willing to roll up their sleeves again. The most common reasons people give for not getting the latest booster shot is that they “don’t think they need one” (44%) and they “don’t think the benefits are worth it” (37%), according to poll results out this week from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The data comes amid announcements by the CDC that boosters reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by up to 57% for U.S. adults and by up to 84% for people age 65 and older. Those figures are just the latest in a mountain of research reporting the public health benefits of COVID-19 vaccines. Despite all of the statistical data, health officials’ recent vaccination campaigns have proven far from compelling.

So far, just 15% of people age 12 and older have gotten the latest booster, and 36% of people age 65 and older have gotten it, the CDC’s vaccination tracker shows. Since the start of the pandemic, 1.1 million people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, with the number of deaths currently rising by 400 per day, The New York Times COVID tracker shows. Many experts continue to note the need for everyone to get booster shots regularly, but some advocate that perhaps a change in strategy is in order. “What the administration should do is push for vaccinating people in high-risk groups, including those who are older, those who are immunocompromised and those who have comorbidities,” Paul Offitt, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. Federal regulators have announced they will meet Jan. 26 with a panel of vaccine advisors to examine the current recommended vaccination schedule as well as look at the effectiveness and composition of current vaccines and boosters, with an eye toward the make-up of next-generation shots.

Vaccines are the “best available protection” against hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19, said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement announcing the planned meeting. “Since the initial authorizations of these vaccines, we have learned that protection wanes over time, especially as the virus rapidly mutates and new variants and subvariants emerge,” he said. “Therefore, it’s important to continue discussions about the optimal composition of COVID-19 vaccines for primary and booster vaccination, as well as the optimal interval for booster vaccination.”",0

960,"June 2, 2022 – Right this minute, scientists are developing new tools that will improve the availability, safety, nutrition, and environmental impact of the food we’ll be eating 50 years from now. They’re mining a vein that reaches back to prehistoric times, when the first hunter-gatherers began farming. The discoveries have come fast and heavy since the Industrial Revolution: 1784: Flour made easy(er). In Philadelphia, Oliver Evans invented the first fully automated flour mill, powered by water. Across the Atlantic Ocean around the same time, Scottish inventor Andrew Meikle devised the first mechanical thresher for harvesting wheat. 1810: Efficient, effective food preservation. The “tin canister” was invented in England. In 1812, the first commercial cannery in the U.S. opened. Canned food fed the military in the 19th century’s large-scale wars, and then expanded to the public. 1863: A huge advance in food safety. Louis Pasteur invented the germ-killing process that would be named for him. 1927: This fridge made it easy to chill at home. Although electric refrigeration had been invented a decade before and some home models existed, it took a while for a mass-produced refrigerator to catch on. Once it did, refrigeration revolutionized the way we shop for, store, and cook food. 1928: Better than ... The first mechanically sliced bread was sold by Missouri's Chillicothe Baking Company. But it didn’t become a thing until Wonder hit the market in 1930, the first nationally distributed sliced bread. 1950: The Green Revolution. The end of World War II ushered in a new era of farming, in which technological innovations led to enormous leaps in production. Factories that had been producing ammonia for explosives were converted to produce nitrogen for chemical fertilizers. Between 1950 and 1998, the use of those fertilizers grew by more than 10 times worldwide. In that period in the U.S., insecticide use went up by a similar amount. And while mules and horses outnumbered tractors on farms by almost 5:1 in 1945, by 1960, more tractors were working than animals. Thanks to these advances and others, today, America has one-third as many farms as we did before World War II, but they produce three times as much food.

1967: Enter the microwave. Amana introduced the Radarange, the first microwave oven small enough and affordable enough for home use. It was another way to make home cooking easier, and it also created a whole new market for frozen dinners. (Microwave popcorn didn’t hit the market until 1981.) 1992: A burgeoning practice: precision agriculture. This relatively new farming practice uses cutting-edge technology to make farming decisions specific to each farm, and even each field. By focusing on the five Rs the right source of nutrients, at the right rate, in the right place, at the right time, in the right way – it produces higher yields using less land, water, and fertilizer, along with fewer herbicides and pesticides. 1994: GMOs hit stores. A tomato became the first produce termed a genetically modified organism (GMO) to come to market. It was engineered to stay firm after harvest, which meant it could ripen on the vine for longer without being damaged in shipping. Within the next few years, GMO summer squash, soybeans, corn, papayas, potatoes, and canola follow. 1999: Farming upward for sustainability. Columbia University professor Dickson Despommier, PhD, conceptualized vertical farming. The practice, which grows crops indoors in vertically stacked, climate-controlled tiers, is expected to reach almost $10 billion in sales by 2025. 2002: The protein of the future? The first lab-grown meat is successfully cultivated from a goldfish. Although it was a major technological breakthrough, it wasn’t sold for public consumption – would you want to eat a goldfish? 2009: Innovations’ unintended result. As food manufacturers continued to refine their methods, the products they created received a new term: “ultra-processed foods.” They’ve been linked to the obesity epidemic and the growth of type 2 diabetes, among other public health problems. By 2018, these foods provided 57% of the calories Americans ate every day. 2019: A vegan burger that bleeds. After 5 years of experimentation, Impossible Foods introduced the Impossible Burger, a plant-based patty that mimics the taste, texture, and appearance of ground beef to an uncanny degree. Yes, it’s ultra-processed.",0

963,"Genetic variations in the skin can create a natural sunscreen, according to University of Queensland researchers investigating the genes linked with vitamin D.

Professor John McGrath from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute said this was one of a number of ways vitamin D affected the body in a collaborative study that looked at the genomes of more than half a million people from the United Kingdom.

""This study has implicated several new skin-related genes that impact on our vitamin D status -- distinct from skin colour which affects our ability to make vitamin D depending on the concentration of the pigment melanin in the skin,"" Professor McGrath said.

""Vitamin D is the sunshine hormone and we need bright sunshine on the skin to make it, but variations in our genes also influence how efficient we are at doing that.

""Our findings suggest that genetic variants in the HAL (histidine ammonia-lyase) gene can vary the concentration of a small molecule in the skin which acts like an internal Sun Protection Factor, or SPF.

This molecule soaks up UVB light -- the light our bodies use to make vitamin D -- and the amount of it in our skin influences how much of the vitamin we can make.

Professor Naomi Wray from UQ's Institute for Molecular Bioscience and Queensland Brain Institute said the team found 143 gene locations linked to vitamin D concentration.

""Previously we only knew about six regions, so these findings will provide new insights into how our body handles vitamin D,"" Professor Wray said.

""The study has found many interesting new candidates that can help our understanding of factors that influence vitamin D concentration.

""Our findings are a treasure trove of clues which will keep researchers busy for a long time.""

The study supports the hypothesis that low vitamin D may be the consequence of poor health, rather than contributing to the risk.

This study was published in Nature Communications and funded by the NHMRC and the Danish National Research Foundation (Niels Bohr Professorship).

964,"Young kids with COVID-19 often have no symptoms at all, even when they have a high amount of the virus in them, according to a new study. Just 14% of adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had no symptoms of the disease, versus 37% of children up to age 4, the researchers found. This raises concern that parents, childcare providers, and preschools may not be seeing the level of infection in seemingly healthy young kids who have been exposed to COVID-19, wrote lead author Ruth A. Karron, MD, and colleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association Open. The study involved 690 people from 175 households in Maryland who were monitored closely between November 2020 and October 2021. Every week for 8 months, they completed online symptom checks and had PCR testing – which detects the presence of the virus causing COVID-19 – done with nasal swabs. Those with symptoms submitted more swabs for analysis. “What was different about our study [compared with previous studies] was the intensity of our collection, and the fact that we [tested those who did not have COVID symptoms],” Karron, a pediatrician and professor in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said in an interview. “The fact that we were sampling every single week meant that we could pick up those early infections.” The study also stands out for its focus on young children, Karron said. All households that took part in the study had at least one child up to 4 years old, with 256 out of the 690 people (37.1%) in this youngest age group. The other people in the study were 100 children ages 5 to 17 (14.5%) and 334 adults ages 18 to 74 (48.4%). Youngest Were Most Likely to Not Have Symptoms By the end of the study, 51 people had tested positive for the coronavirus, including 14 who had no symptoms. A closer look showed that children ages 4 and younger who got COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to not have symptoms as infected adults (36.8% vs. 14.3%).

The relationship between symptoms and viral load – the amount of the virus that causes COVID in a person – also differed between adults and young children. While adults with high viral loads – suggesting they were more contagious – typically had more severe COVID-19 symptoms, that was not the case with young kids. This suggests that children with mild or no symptoms could still be highly contagious. Karron says these findings should help parents and others make better decisions. She says that even if young children don’t have symptoms, they should be tested for COVID-19 if they have been exposed to others with the disease. And she recommends acting on the results. “If a family is infected with the virus, and the 2-year-old [has no symptoms], and people are thinking about a visit to elderly grandparents … one shouldn’t assume that the 2-year-old is uninfected,” Karron says. “That child should be tested along with other family members.” Testing should also be considered for young children exposed to COVID-19 at childcare facilities, she says. But other experts did not necessarily agree. “I question whether that effort is worth it,” says Dean Blumberg, MD, a professor and chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UC Davis Health in Sacramento, CA. He notes that recent FDA guidance for COVID-19 testing calls for three negative at-home antigen tests – which detect proteins, called antigens, from the virus that causes COVID-19 – to confirm lack of disease. “That would take 4 days to get those tests done,” he says. “So, it’s a lot of testing. It’s a lot of record keeping, it’s inconvenient, it’s uncomfortable to be tested, and I just question whether it’s worth that effort.” Do the Findings Still Apply? Blumberg also questions whether the study, which was completed almost a year ago, reflects the current pandemic landscape. Although the experts interviewed had different opinions of the findings, they shared similar views on vaccination. “The most important thing that parents can do is get their kids vaccinated, be vaccinated themselves, and have everybody in the household vaccinated and up to date for all doses that are indicated,” Blumberg says.",0
965,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Transplanted livers change the profile of blood cells in the recipients, reducing the potential for organ rejection, Mayo Clinic research shows. The findings are published in Kidney International.

For decades, transplant experts have observed that liver transplant recipients often need less anti-rejection medication, known as immunosuppressive drugs, than recipients of other solid organs. Similarly, when patients receive a multiple-organ transplant that includes the liver along with any other organ, they need less immunosuppressive medication and have less incidence of rejection even if they are highly sensitive to cellular bad actors, known as antigens, from the donor organs.

“This study shows that the liver transplant itself regulates the host’s immune responses. Compared to the other organs, the liver is immunologically a very active organ, so it is capable of regulating the immune responses against itself, said lead author Timucin Taner, M.D., Ph.D., a transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic.

When patients undergo a dual kidney-liver transplant, the liver has a protective effect on the kidney, the study found.

Researchers compared the blood samples of organ recipients a year after a kidney transplant, liver transplant or kidney-liver transplant. It found that patients who received a liver and kidney at the same time, or a liver alone, had fewer of the cells that leap into action to defend the body from an invader — known as killer cells or T cells — compared with people who had a kidney transplant alone. While the T cells of the liver transplant recipients reacted to the donor organ cells weakly, their reaction to other antigens was preserved.

The research helps pave the way for ongoing studies on the transplanted livers’ unique properties. The hope is that one day researchers will identify how the liver regulates the immune response and to mimic that to help patients receiving other types of transplants scale back their need for anti-rejection drugs.

Immunosuppression drugs are a necessary but difficult aspect of post-transplant care. Without it, the transplant would not be successful because the body would almost immediately reject the donor organ. But immunosuppression itself causes increased risk for infection, cancer and other issues. Future therapies may provide ways to target immune protection to the donated organ, and minimize the risks of immunosuppression for the patients.

With campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant provider in the United States.

April is Donate Life Month. Nearly 115,000 people are waiting for an organ transplant in the United States. Mayo Clinic has approximately 3,000 patients on the waiting list for an organ transplant. Every 10 minutes another name is added to the national waiting list. An average of 22 people die each day in the United States waiting for transplants that can’t take place because of the shortage of donated organs.

Fainting can happen after many types of vaccinations.Fainting can be triggered by many types of medical procedures. In fact, CDC has received reports of people fainting after nearly all vaccines. Fainting after getting a vaccine is most commonly reported after three vaccines given to adolescents: HPV, MCV4, and Tdap. Because the ingredients of these three vaccines are different, yet fainting is seen with all of them, scientists think that fainting is due to the vaccination process and not to the vaccines themselves. However, there is not yet a definite answer about whether an ingredient of the vaccines is responsible for the fainting or if adolescents are simply more likely than children or adults to experience fainting. About 3% of men and 3.5% of women report fainting at least once during their lifetimes, but it is not known just how often fainting happens after vaccination. Because fainting usually has no lasting effects, it is hard to study using medical records-based systems. However, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), receives many reports of syncope each year, and many more are likely to go unreported.

The most common example of this phenomenon is the practice referred to by the term couvade. Most commonly found among peoples in the Amazon basin (Gregor, 1985), the couvade is also found in Melanesia (Blackwood, 1935; Meigs, 1976). In general, during some portion, or all, of his spouse's pregnancy and childbirth, a man takes on some aspects of the woman's behavioral complex. This may range from observing the same food regulations to taking to his bed and experiencing the pains of childbirth, or observing restrictions on sexual activity. Sometimes, the couvade lasts until the child is weaned. ...

Among the Gabra in Kenya and Ethiopia, men, as they age, pass through a period in which they are said to be women (Wood, 1996, Wood, 1999). In a slightly different vein, Turnbull (1986) argues that the Mbuti in the Ituri Rainforest region of the Democratic Republic of Congo are genderless until they marry; that is, they pass through childhood without a distinct gender identity and are transformed only later.

968,"Sept. 30, 2022 -- The number of people in the United States who died by suicide increased 4% in 2021 compared to the previous year, the National Center for Health Statistics reported . The agency said 47,646 people died by suicide in 2021 compared to 45,979 in 2020. The number of suicides had fallen the two previous years. Before that, the national suicide rate increased 35% from 1999 to 2018, when it hit a peak of 48,344, the NCHS said. “Suicide is a major contributor to premature death in the United States, especially among people aged 10 [to] 34, for whom it is the second leading cause of death,” the report said. Provisional numbers showed the number of males dying by suicide in 2021 was four times that for females – 38,025 compared to 9,621. The age group with the biggest percentage increase was males 15 to 24, which saw an 8% increase from 2020 to 2021. Experts weren’t sure what caused the overall increase but noted that suicide numbers dropped in 2020, the year the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation, compared to the previous year.

“Suicides did not skyrocket the way a lot of people thought they would” during the pandemic, Doreen Marshall, PhD, a psychologist and vice president of mission engagement with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told CNN. That may have been because people were “trying to head off what we were afraid would happen,” she said. Julie Cerel, PhD, director of the Suicide Prevention and Exposure Lab at the University of Kentucky, noted that ""people were looking after each other"" early in the pandemic, NBC News reported. The report also showed that suicides increased among another vulnerable demographic: middle school-aged girls. In 2022, 237 girls aged 10 to 14 died by suicide, a 16% increase from the 204 suicide deaths in 2020, the report said. ""We can't jump to any conclusions,"" Cerel said.

Calls to the hotline increased 45% compared to the same time in the previous year, CNN said. “The impulse to act is a very short, intense one.

972,"According to an open-access Editor's Choice article in ARRS' American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), third-trimester fetuses with in utero opioid exposure exhibited multiple smaller 2D biometric measurements of the brain, as well as altered fetal physiology, on investigational MRI.

Noting the scarcity of imaging literature evaluating prenatal opioid exposure on brain development, ""our findings demonstrate the impact of prenatal opioid exposure on fetal brain development, which may in turn affect postnatal clinical outcomes,"" wrote first author Usha D. Nagaraj, MD, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio.

Nagaraj and colleagues' prospective multicenter case-control study included 65 women (mean age, 29 years) in their third trimester of pregnancy who underwent fetal MRI from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 at three U.S. academic medical centers: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Arkansas Children's Hospital, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A total of 28 fetuses (mean gestational age, 32.3 weeks)

were classified as opioid-exposed, while 37 fetuses (mean gestational age, 31.9 weeks) were unexposed in utero. Fourteen 2D biometric measurements of the fetal brain were manually assessed and used to derive four indices.

When adjusting for gestational age, fetal sex, and nicotine exposure, 7 of the 14 2D biometric measurements -- cerebral fronto-occipital diameter, bone biparietal diameter, brain biparietal diameter, corpus callosum length, vermis height, anterior-posterior pons measurement, and transverse cerebellar diameter -- were significantly smaller in opioid-exposed fetuses than in unexposed fetuses, as measured on fetal MRI.

973,"A major new study in the journal Nature reveals a 'traffic light' mechanism controlling genetic activity within cells -- a system which could potentially be targeted by cancer drugs already in development.

The research describes how 'epigenetic' changes to the structure of DNA can act as a stop-go signal in determining whether a gene should be read.

Unlike our genetic make-up, which is well understood, the world of epigenetics is still largely unexplored and referred to as the 'dark matter' of the genome.

But the new findings answer a fundamental and longstanding question -- how epigenetic proteins regulate the processes of transcription and gene expression, through which our genes are read and translated into proteins.

Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, today (Wednesday) reveal how a key epigenetic signal called H3K4me3 -- determines when and how DNA should be read and translated into proteins within our cells.

The study shows that H3K4me3 ensures genes are transcribed and activated at the right time in a controlled manner, like a set of traffic lights regulating the flow of cars on a busy road. Understanding how it functions in normal cells can also shed new light on the development of cancer -- and the role played by a breakdown in the regulation of gene activity.

It has been known for more than 20 years that the enzymes placing H3K4me3, a chemical tag added to DNA, are crucial for normal cell development, as well as being linked to leukaemia, breast, bowel and pancreatic cancers. But, until now, scientists lacked an understanding of what the chemical tag does, despite many years of research.

The new 'textbook discovery', as described by the researchers, transforms our understanding of:
• how epigenetic proteins help regulate cell development and can be involved in cancer
• how the process of gene expression -- decoding DNA into functional proteins used by our body -- is regulated
• how blocking epigenetic proteins could affect both normal and cancer cells.

The long-term hope is that this new understanding could lead to a new class of cancer treatments that target epigenetic 'traffic lights' to block the activity of genes that may be fuelling cancer.

The study was funded by The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) itself and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Epigenetics affects gene activity, or expression, without changing the underlying genetic code -- for example, by adding or removing chemical tags or modifications to DNA or proteins that the DNA is wrapped around, called histones. Chemical modifications such as H3K4me3 (tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4) can turn genes on or off, and are often altered in cancer.

Using mouse stem cells and sophisticated genetic and biochemical experiments in the lab, researchers found that the H3K4me3 modification is essential for regulating how and when our genes are expressed.

The team found that H3K4me3 acts like a traffic light at a busy intersection. By regulating the flow of RNA polymerase II -- a protein complex that reads and decodes DNA -- H3K4me3 determines when gene expression should start and the speed at which it runs.

When it gives the green light, H3K4me3 allows RNA polymerase II to move along DNA, transcribing it into RNA as it moves. But without H3K4me3, RNA polymerase II gets stuck at specific points on the DNA, creating a hold-up and slowing down transcription.

Previous results have suggested that disrupting or changing H3K4me3 levels in cells is important for cancer development and affects response to treatment.

Study leader Professor Kristian Helin, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and a world leader in the study of epigenetics, said:

""Our study offers a fundamental new understanding of epigenetics, a very exciting and still largely underexplored area of cancer research. We have solved a 20-year-old puzzle by discovering how a well-known epigenetic modification controls gene expression. Because the enzymes determining the level of H3K4me3 in the cell frequently are found mutated in cancer, our studies could have implications for understanding and treating cancer.

""This is what I call 'textbook' science -- the aspiration of many scientists, including myself, to solve fundamental questions so that our discoveries go into textbooks. Even the most cutting-edge treatments for patients are built on the foundations of fundamental scientific discoveries like this one. It is only thanks to basic understanding of how or genes and cells work, and what can go wrong with them, that we can create the cancer treatments of the future.

""Drugs targeting these 'traffic lights', or epigenetic modifications, such as H3K4me3, are already being developed -- and it is possible that they could one day become an effective way of treating cancer patients. This is an exciting new avenue for cancer research, and we believe our findings will pave the way for more effective development of these epigenetic drugs.""",0

As for mentioning 2020, well 2020-2030 was just significant years to me, as well as many other people that are educated on these esoteric topics. 10 years ago it was said that 2012 was nothing to worry about, it's 2020-30 to pay attention to. To me, the lyrics are just more of a coincidence than a prediction as I don't feel I was 'trying' to predict anything, I just rapped about what I was watching. (Check comment section for one of the vids that inspired writing some of the pandemic track). But call it a prediction, dumb luck, coincidence, remote viewing, predictive programming (lmao) or whatever you want.

981,"It's a mystery how human thoughts and dreams emerge from electrical pulses in the brain's estimated 100 trillion synapses, and Rice University neuroengineer Chong Xie dreams of changing that by creating a system that can record all the electrical activity in a living brain.

In a recently published study in Nature Biomedical Engineering, Xie and colleagues described their latest achievement toward that goal, a 3D electrode array that allows them to map the locations and activity of up to 1 million potential synaptic links in a living brain based on recordings of the millisecond-scale evolution of electrical pulses in tens of thousands of neurons in a cubic millimeter of brain tissue.

""The thing that is novel about this work is the recording density,"" said Xie, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice and a core member of the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative. ""Microcircuits in the brain are very mysterious. We don't have many ways to map their activity, especially volumetrically. We want to deliver very dense recordings of the cortex because those are important, scientifically, for understanding how brain circuits work.""

Xie collaborated on the study with colleagues from Rice and the University of California, San Francisco, including Loren Frank of UCSF and co-corresponding author Lan Luan of Rice.

Neurons are small. Each cubic millimeter of brain tissue contains about 100,000. That density is roughly the same for humans and other mammals, including the rodents that are the subject of experiments in Xie's lab. The processing power of the brain arises from synaptic connections between neurons. Synaptically linked neuron pairs are connected by narrow bridges of tissue called axons, which are just a few millionths of a meter in diameter.

Xie's team has spent years developing a material called nanoelectronic thread (NET) that is thin, ultraflexible and biocompatible, a trifecta of properties for making minimally invasive electrode implants. In previous studies, Xie's team has demonstrated techniques for emplanting tightly packed NET arrays of up to 128 electrodes. The researchers also showed their arrays could stay in place for up to 10 months, recording the pulsed spikes of electricity, or action potentials, in nearby neurons.

""When neurons fire action potentials, there are very faint electrical signals coming out of them,"" Xie said. ""You have to place the electrodes very close to each neuron in order to capture that signal. Usually, that means a distance less than 100 microns.""

Using electrodes to record neuronal spikes has been a primary technique in neuroscience for decades, but the evolution of electrode materials has gradually transformed the implantation of neural electrodes from highly invasive procedures that damaged the very brain tissue the electrodes were meant to measure to procedures that result in no measurable tissue damage.

One of the primary focuses of Xie's lab is scaling up the size of its implant arrays. In the new study, Xie and colleagues, including Hanlin Zhu, one of the lead graduate students on the project, implanted arrays of 1,024 NET electrodes in a 1 cubic millimeter volume of brain tissue.

""The primary signals we try to measure are the electrical spikes coming from neurons,"" Xie said. ""That's how they communicate. And one thing we care a lot about and really want to understand is how neurons are connected.""

Xie said there is no straightforward way to probe synaptic connections

""Axons can be very long, and each neuron can be connected by many thousands of others,"" he said. ""It's a very, very, very messy network. And probing it is an extremely challenging task, especially while the brain is working.""

The density of the new electrode array, together with its ability to capture millisecond-by-millisecond changes in the electrical spikes of individual neurons allowed Xie and co-authors to decipher potential synaptic links between neuron pairs.

""When the synapse works, you usually see a typical pattern when you look at the firing activity of the two neurons,"" Xie said.

It takes a bit of time for the electrical impulse that starts in the presynaptic neurons to propagate down the axon and activate the postsynaptic neuron, he said.

""We record many, many spikes, and then we need to sort the spikes and attribute each of them to individual neurons,"" he said. ""We know the location of each electrode, or channel. And each channel records no more than a few neurons at a time. Each neuron is also typically recorded by more than one contact as well. So, you can do something akin to triangulation to identify the location of individual neurons.""

Once the neurons are mapped, it's relatively easy to calculate the distance between them and from that, the propagation time for synaptic activation.

The 1,024-electrode array gave Xie's team a ratio of approximately one electrode per 100 neurons in the cubic millimeter volume of brain tissue under study. The lab is working to create denser arrays that pack more electrodes into the same volume.

The vast majority of neurons in people's brains are unused, despite the fact that our brains typically consume about as much energy as can be supplied by the body. Neuroscientists don't fully understand why the brain has so many unused neurons, and Xie said that's a factor his team considers in the design of their electrode arrays.

""I want to capture as much of the interactivity as possible,"" he said. ""I would argue that we don't need a 1-to-1 ratio of electrodes to neurons to capture all of it, and it is indeed my dream to capture all the interactivity.""

985,"McGill University researchers identify proteins that drive cancer stem cells. Targeting and supressing a particular protein called galectin1 could provide a more effective treatment for glioblastoma, in combination with radiation therapy.

Due to its resistance to therapy, glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive cancerous brain tumour in adults. It grows fast and spreads quickly. While treatments such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can help ease symptoms for a few months, in most cases tumour cells regrow after treatment and the cancer recurs.

According to the researchers, no matter how low the weeds are cut, if the roots are not pulled out, the weeds will just grow back.

Getting to the root of the problem

Among all cancerous cells, some act as stem cells that reproduce themselves and sustain the cancer, much like normal stem cells typically renew and sustain our organs and tissues, say the researchers. By targeting the way the cells operate, they discovered a new way to disrupt the production of new tumours.

""What we found was really astonishing for us. After we inhibited the galectin1 protein, the brain tumours simply didn't grow for several months,"" says Arezu Jahani-Asl, an Associate Professor of Medicine at McGill University. ""To improve patient response to therapy, we must exploit these newly identified vulnerabilities in cancer stem cells.""

The researchers discovered that a protein called galectin1 interacts with another protein called HOXA5 to control the genetic programs that drive cancer stem cell behaviour. By supressing galectin1 in preclinical models, they found a significant improvement in tumour response to radiation therapy, resulting in expanded lifespan.

The researchers also analyzed patient databases and found that glioblastoma patients with low expression of galectin1 and HOXA5 proteins had the best prognosis. Together, these proteins along with another called STAT3 activate mechanisms that promote a particularly aggressive type of glioblastoma.

Paving the way for new therapies

The discovery sheds light on the mechanisms that regulate cancer stem cells. The findings provide evidence that targeting galectin1 protein, in combination with radiation therapy, can pave the way for future clinical trials to treat glioblastoma tumours. The next step is to compare the effectiveness of different approaches to supressing the galectin1 and HOXA5 complex in the brain, with advances in gene therapy through CRISPR technology.",0
986,"Bacon could be back on the menu of health-conscious diners thanks to an unlikely salvation: Japanese knotweed.

The fast-growing plant, feared by homeowners for its ability to invade gardens and buildings, contains a chemical which could take the place of the nitrite preservative in cured meats such as bacon and sausages.

Diets high in nitrite have been linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancers -- leading scientists, including at the University of Reading, to look for alternatives.

The PHYTOME project has developed processed red meat that includes added natural substitutes which reduces the carcinogenic compound nitrite added to preserve meats. The range of sausages and hams had a mixture of plants and fruits added to them which included rosemary, green tea, and resveratrol -- an extract taken from Japanese Knotweed.

As well as developing versions of cooked and dry cured red meats which replaced nitrite with these natural alternatives, the project also tested whether those substitutes would have an effect alongside normal nitrite levels found in processed red meats.

In a paper published in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research, the international team of scientists have tested the specially formulated products against conventionally processed red meat as well as white meat.

They found that tell-tale signs of nitrite content in participants' faeces were significantly lower from both specially formulated meats, and levels were like those who were fed on minimally processed white meat.

Gunter Kuhnle, Professor of Nutrition and Food Science at the University of Reading, said:

""The ongoing worries about highly processed red meat have often focused on the role of nitrite, and its links with cancer. The PHYTOME project tackled the issue by creating processed red meat products that replace additives with plant-based alternatives.

""Our latest findings show that using natural additives in processed red meat reduces the creation of compounds in the body that are linked to cancer.

""Surprisingly, the natural additives seemed to have some protective effects even when the red meat still contained nitrite. This suggests that natural additives could be used to reduce some of the potentially harmful effects of nitrite, even in foods where it is not possible to take out nitrite preservatives altogether.""

A major consideration for the team was how the nitrate content in drinking water can significantly affect the formation of nitrite, which is produced in the body, as found in previous research.

The team controlled for this by controlling water content during the trial and participants were tested with both low and high nitrate-containing water across separate testing periods.

By controlling for drinking water, the results showed that PHYTOME red meats produced lower levels of the tell-tale signs of nitrite production in the body than either conventional red meat, or the unprocessed white meat.",0

The finding brings new hope for IBM patients with weakness, inflammation or atrophy of muscles in their fingers, wrists, forearms or quadriceps. There is no cure for IBM, nor is there an effective treatment, according to the National Institutes of Health.

""The immunization wasn't a complete fix, but it significantly slowed the deterioration of motor function in our IBM mice,"" said Frank LaFerla, director of UC Irvine's Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia. ""I hope our discovery leads to clinical trials and, eventually, a vaccine for people suffering from or at risk for IBM.

LaFerla and assistant project scientist Masashi Kitazawa tested the vaccine on 1-year-old mice with high levels of a protein called beta amyloid in their skeletal muscle tissue - a characteristic feature of IBM.

After three months of treatment, the mice were producing antibodies against beta amyloid and had less of the protein in their muscles. Levels of oligomeric beta amyloid - a more toxic form - also were reduced.

""It appears the antibodies helped remove beta amyloid or blocked its accumulation in muscle cells so they could stay healthy longer,"" Kitazawa said.

Immunotherapy approaches such as vaccination are being extensively studied for Alzheimer's in humans. In that disease, beta amyloid accumulates in the brain and leads to the creation of senile plaques, one of two signature Alzheimer's lesions. Although immunotherapy has shown some benefit in human clinical trials, there are significant safety concerns. For example, about 6 percent of people develop encephalitis, or brain inflammation.

LaFerla thinks it's unlikely IBM patients would develop encephalitis: ""With IBM, brain integrity is not compromised like it is with Alzheimer's. We should be cautious, but there's little reason to assume IBM patients would have the same problem.""

990,"The autoimmune disease lupus may be triggered by a defective process in the development of red blood cells (RBCs), according to a study led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine. The discovery could lead to new methods for classifying and treating patients with this disease.

The researchers, who published their findings August 11 in Cell, found that in a number of lupus patients, maturing red blood cells fail to get rid of their mitochondria -- tiny molecular reactors that help convert oxygen into chemical energy in most cell types, but are normally excluded from red blood cells. This abnormal retention of mitochondria can trigger the cascade of inappropriate and harmful immune activity that is characteristic of the disease.

""Our findings support that red blood cells can play a really important role in driving inflammation in a subgroup of lupus patients,"" said senior author Dr. Virginia Pascual, the Drukier Director of the Gale and Ira Drukier Institute for Children's Health and the Ronay Menschel Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""So this adds a new piece to the lupus puzzle, and could now open the door to new possibilities for therapeutic interventions.""

The lead author of the study was Dr. Simone Caielli, assistant professor of immunology research at the Drukier Institute and the Department of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Lupus, also known as systemic lupus erythematosus, is a chronic disorder that features intermittent and sometimes debilitating attacks by the immune system on the body's own healthy tissues, including skin, joints, hair follicles, heart and kidneys. A common underlying factor is the abnormally elevated production of immune-activating proteins called type I interferons. Treatments, which often are taken long-term and have side effects, aim to suppress immune activity, including interferon-driven inflammation. There is no cure for lupus, and how it arises is still largely mysterious. It is estimated to affect roughly 200,000 people in the United States, the vast majority of whom are female.

Previous studies have shown defective mitochondria within immune cells of lupus patients. In the new study, the researchers examined red blood cells, which are supposed to have no mitochondria at all. They found that a large number of lupus patients had red blood cells with detectable levels of mitochondria -- and these cells were especially frequent in patients with the most severe lupus symptoms. By contrast, healthy controls had no mitochondria-containing red blood cells.

Dr. Caielli then studied how human red blood cells normally rid themselves of mitochondria as they mature, as prior studies had mainly examined this in mice, and why this process could be defective in lupus patients.

Further experiments revealed how these abnormal red blood cells cause inflammation. In general, as red blood cells age or display signs of damage they are removed by scavenger immune cells called macrophages. Antibodies that bind red blood cells also facilitate their removal. Once ingested by macrophages, the red blood cells' mitochondrial DNA stimulates a powerful inflammatory pathway called the cGAS/STING pathway, which in turn drives type I interferon production. Underlining the relevance of these findings, ""those lupus patients with mitochondria-containing red blood cells and evidence of circulating anti-RBC antibodies had higher interferon signatures compared to those who didn't,"" Dr. Caielli said.

The researchers are now continuing to study the complex process by which mitochondria are retained in red blood cells and end up driving abnormal immune activation. Identifying patients whose lupus symptoms are driven this way might permit to detect when they are likely to undergo lupus flares and to identify specific therapies for them.",0
991,"The beta-carotene in so-called ""Golden Rice"" converts to vitamin A in humans, according to researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Tufts University in an article that appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Golden Rice was developed in the early 1990s with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation with the goal of creating rice that had beta-carotene -- a vitamin A precursor – in the rice grain. In its current form, Golden Rice contains 35 micrograms of beta-carotene per gram.

""We found that four units of beta-carotene from Golden Rice convert to one unit of vitamin A in humans,"" said Dr. Michael Grusak, associate professor of pediatrics at the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at BCM and Texas Children's Hospital.

They determined this by feeding five healthy adults a specific amount of specially-labeled Golden Rice and measured the amount of retinol, a form of vitamin A, in the blood.

Vitamin A deficiency is prevalent in many parts of the world where poorer community members rely on rice as their major food source. People who lack adequate amounts of this vitamin can have vision problems or even blindness as a result.

""By incorporating vitamin A into the major crop that is consumed, we would be able to make it accessible to the majority of people in the area,"" said Grusak.

993,"People with diabetes who experience periods of low blood sugar -- a common occurrence in those new to blood sugar management -- are more likely to have worsening diabetic eye disease. Now, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine say they have linked such low blood sugar levels with a molecular pathway that is turned on in oxygen-starved cells in the eye.

The research, involving human and mouse eye cells and intact retinas grown in a low sugar (low glucose) environment in the laboratory, as well as mice with low glucose levels, was published in the January issue of Cell Reports.

""Temporary episodes of low glucose happen once or twice a day in people with insulin-dependent diabetes and often among people newly diagnosed with the condition,"" says Akrit Sodhi, M.D., Ph.D., the Branna and Irving Sisenwein Professor of Ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Low glucose levels can also occur during sleep in people with non-insulin dependent diabetes. ""Our results show that these periodic low glucose levels cause an increase in certain retinal cell proteins, resulting in an overgrowth of blood vessels and worsening diabetic eye disease,"" adds Sodhi.

Eye disease among people with diabetes is among the most preventable causes of blindness in the U.S. Diabetic retinopathy, which occurs in up to a third of people with diabetes, is characterized by the overgrowth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina.

Sodhi says the current study suggests that people with diabetic retinopathy may be particularly vulnerable to periods of low glucose, and keeping glucose levels stable should be an important part of glucose control.

For the study, the researchers analyzed protein levels in human and mouse retinal cells and intact retinas grown in an environment of low glucose in the laboratory, as well as in mice that had occasional low blood sugar.

The researchers found that low glucose levels in human and mouse retinal cells caused a cascade of molecular changes that can lead to blood vessel overgrowth. First, the researchers saw that low glucose caused a decrease in retinal cells' ability to break down glucose for energy.

When the researchers looked specifically at so-called Müller glial cells, which are supportive cells for neurons in the retina and rely primarily on glucose for energy production, they found that the cells increased the expression of the GLUT1 gene, which makes a protein that transports glucose into cells.

The researchers found that, in response to low glucose, the cells increased levels of a transcription factor, called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. This turned on the cellular machinery -- including GLUT1 -- needed to improve their ability to utilize available glucose, preserving the limited oxygen available for energy production by retinal neurons.

However, in low-oxygen environments, as occurs in the retinas of patients with diabetic eye disease, this normal, physiologic response to low glucose triggered a flood of HIF-1α protein into the cells' nucleus, the cell's control center.

This resulted in an increase in the production of proteins such as VEGF and ANGPTL4, which cause the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels -- the key culprit of vision loss in people with diabetic eye disease.

The researchers plan to study whether low glucose levels in people with diabetes may impact similar molecular pathways in other organs, such as the kidney and brain.

Sodhi says the HIF-1α pathway may serve as an effective target for developing new treatments for diabetic eye disease.

Other researchers involved in the study include Chuanyu Guo, Monika Deshpande, Yueqi Niu, Isha Kachwala, Haley Megarity, Taylor Nuse, Savalan Babapoor-Farrokhran, Michael Ramada, Jaron Sanchez, Neelay Inamdar and Thomas V. Johnson of Johns Hopkins; Miguel Flores-Bellver and Maria Valeria Canto-Soler of the University of Colorado; and Silvia Montaner of the University of Maryland.

994,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Outpatient surgery may be an option for people who are having their hips, knees or other joints replaced.

It is part of a trend in orthopedic surgery to move total joint arthroplasty, commonly known as joint replacement, from inpatient to outpatient surgery. Patients benefit from the shorter hospital stay, and they are more satisfied recovering at home.

A decade ago, a patient who had a knee or hip replacement would likely stay in the hospital for a week. Even four years ago, the average hospital stay was around four days. Some patients now can go home the same day, says Hugh M. Smith, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic anesthesiologist.

""It is fundamentally a major surgery,"" says Matthew Abdel, M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon. ""Everything related to that remains essential– preparing the patient, educating the patient, managing expectations, and having a multidisciplinary team in place – all must work together to allow that patient to go home that day safely.""

The hip, knee, and shoulder joints are most amenable to outpatient surgery, but not all joint replacement patients are candidates for outpatient surgery. Surgeons, anesthesiologists, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and other care team members assess whether outpatient surgery is appropriate. They look at the patient's medical condition, whether the patient will be safe and comfortable at home after surgery, have adequate pain control, and have a person who can care for them there, Dr. Smith says.

Before surgery, physical therapists work with patients, and utilize a robust strategy for making sure patients get enough fluids before surgery. During surgery, anesthesiologists use short-acting anesthetics, which help patients mobilize earlier after surgery.

Patients have been receptive to outpatient surgery, Dr. Abdel says. It mitigates risk factors such as infections acquired in the hospital, blood clots, and lung and urinary problems.

""It takes a village,"" Dr. Smith says. ""We’re talking about delivering very sophisticated, fairly innovative surgical and anesthetic techniques. Ultimately, it comes down to the people, a coordinated and integrated effort by a broad set of care providers, and systems that enable this type of outcome.”

""It's a patient satisfier,"" Dr. Abdel says. ""You recuperate with your family. You recuperate in your home environment. You don't feel like you're institutionalized. You feel a part of a well model of care.""

A flight map of the Tuesday before Thanksgiving showed a staggering amount of Americans were traveling for the holiday – something experts and politicians warned against.

Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci warned in October that Americans would have to make an “individual choice” when it came to traveling during the holiday season while speaking during a live Q&A with Yahoo News.

“Each individual family needs to make the decision based upon the risk situation in your own family,” Fauci said, noting Americans may need to “bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering.”

“My Thanksgiving is going to look very different this year,” he said, adding that the traveling required to have his family together was not worth the risk.

Just a few days before Thanksgiving, he again warned while speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that there would be “an increase” weeks after Thanksgiving.

He also warned after Thanksgiving that there would be a significant case surge after millions traveled for the holiday, according to POLITICO.

Roughly 22% of Americans were not home on Thanksgiving, according to data compiled by SafeGraph, according to Bloomberg.

NPR estimated that 42% of Americans stayed home this Thanksgiving, up roughly 6% from the previous year. (RELATED: ‘I Didn’t Know I Had It’: 107-Year-Old Woman Defeats COVID-19)

Data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) days prior to the holiday showed more than three million people traveled through airports despite guidance suggesting otherwise.

However, nearly three weeks later, there so far appears to be no post-holiday surge in numerous cities and states.

“We haven’t seen something significant to talk about now,” Illinois Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “We’ll see for sure in this coming week … We’ll keep our fingers crossed that maybe we’re not going to see a big bump.”

Ezike was one of many public health officials who cautioned Americans to skip out on family gatherings, noting that the celebrations could actually be super spreader events, according to the report. The average new detected infections was declining prior to Thanksgiving but rose a bit afterwards. However, it has since been on the decline, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The decline could be partially attributed to the fact that the state implemented Tier 3 designation on Nov. 20 which limited how many people could be in a business at one time and banned indoor dining, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that the state was also not experiencing a post-Thanksgiving coronavirus spike, according to the Associated Press (AP).

“We are cautiously optimistic that there was not a post-Thanksgiving surge in cases,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive said, according to the AP. “That means many Michiganders did their part in keeping the spread of the virus down over the Thanksgiving holiday.”

Like Illinois, the state also prohibited indoor dining and shut down some businesses on Nov. 18 to slow the spread, according to the report.

Minnesota has also not seen a Thanksgiving related coronavirus case surge. Data reporter David Montgomery with MPR News said he feels confident that Thanksgiving didn’t seem to contribute to any new cases, according to KARE 11.

“There’s absolutely no sign of a direct trend-changing impact from Thanksgiving gatherings here in Minnesota,” Montgomery said, according to the report.

“This doesn’t mean that cases might not have fallen even more without Thanksgiving,” he added.

However, some health officials worry that an indirect surge could occur in which someone who was infected spread it to others and that data will show up far later, according to the report.

While some states have seen an increase in cases from Thanksgiving, which was Nov. 26, most were also on an upward trend. Using The New York Times (NYT) 7-day rolling average, the Daily Caller looked at the percent increase of the 7-day rolling average of coronavirus cases between Nov. 12 and Nov. 26 compared to the percent increase between Nov. 27 and Dec. 10.

In Alabama, there was a near 28% increase in coronavirus cases between Nov. 12 and Nov. 26. In the two weeks following Thanksgiving, the state saw coronavirus cases increase by approximately 34.7%.

Similarly, Arizona has also been on an upward trend since September. Between Nov. 12 and Nov. 26, the state saw an average increase in new cases of roughly 45.91%. Between Nov. 26 and Dec. 10, while cases have still increased, the rate at which they’re increasing actually fell to 39.1%.

California, which has seen an overall spike in new cases since November, recorded an approximate 48.3% increase between Nov. 12 and Nov. 26. That number only slightly increased to a near 52.59% when looking at the data between Nov. 26 and Dec. 10.

On the contrary, New York appears to show a spike in new cases following the holiday, though it is unclear what caused the spike. Between Nov. 12-Nov. 26 the coronavirus cases increased by roughly 34%. However, between Nov. 26 and Dec. 10 cases increased by 41.9%.

The Daily Caller chose the four states based on the NYT map that indicated these states were seeing the highest number of average daily cases per 100,000 people in the past week.""",1

1001,"Blocking the inhibition of PKD1 and PKD2 gene expression by deleting a binding site for microRNAs hindered the formation and growth of kidney cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) models, UT Southwestern researchers reported. The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest a strategy for gene therapy with the potential to arrest or cure ADPKD.

""For more than 25 years, we have known that ADPKD is caused by mutations of PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Yet, no therapeutic strategy exists to go after these root causes,"" said Vishal Patel, M.D., Associate Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at UTSW and corresponding author of the paper.

ADPKD is among the most common human genetic conditions and the most frequent genetic cause of kidney failure, affecting an estimated 12.5 million people worldwide. ADPKD is an inherited disease in which patients typically inherit one mutated copy of PKD1 (or PKD2) and one normal copy. The disease is characterized by the frequent formation of many small fluid-filled sacs called kidney cysts, which are believed to form when the levels of PKD1 or PKD2 fall below a critical threshold. This can occur when the normal copy of the gene does not produce enough of the proteins Polycystin-1/Polycystin-2.

Proteins are produced (or translated) from a gene's messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). At one end of the mRNA strand is a region of code that helps protect it from degradation but can also control how much of the protein is made. The binding of microRNAs to this region of the mRNA code can block translation, leading to production of less protein.

PKD1 contains a binding site for miR-17, a microRNA that is highly expressed and active in models of ADPKD. So, Dr. Patel and his colleagues asked if blocking the binding of miR-17 to PKD1 could prevent kidney cyst formation.

The researchers deleted the miR-17 binding site from PKD1 mRNA in cell cultures and an ADPKD mouse model. Their results indicated that deletion of the binding site increased stability of the mRNA strand, raised Polycystin-1 levels, and decreased kidney cyst growth. Moreover, the group found that blocking miR-17 binding to PKD1 mRNA with an anti-miR-17 drug after cyst formation also decreased cyst growth, indicating that this interaction could be a promising target for polycystic kidney disease (PKD) treatment.

""There are numerous genetic conditions where one copy of the causative gene is mutated, but the other copy is still normal. Our approach to harnessing the remaining normal copy is likely applicable to many other diseases besides PKD,"" said Dr. Patel.

UT Southwestern opened a PKD and genetic kidney disease clinic in 2016 that is co-led by Ronak Lakhia, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at UTSW. Dr. Lakhia is the co-first author on this study with Harini Ramalingam, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Patel lab. The UTSW PKD clinic is now the largest such clinic in Texas, said Dr. Lakhia, gaining recognition as a site for innovative clinical trials.

1005,"Amid longstanding debate on the effectiveness of the tuberculosis vaccine, a new study suggests that the vaccine is protective against TB in children under 5, but adolescents and adults in high-burden countries may need additional protection to maintain immunity beyond childhood.

The tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is one of the most widely administered vaccines across the globe. Nearly 100 years old, it is the only vaccine ever administered to treat TB, which afflicts more than 10 million people each year.

Despite the age and widespread use of the BCG vaccine, there is still considerable debate on its effectiveness in preventing TB, and how long immunity may last after it is administered in infancy. And as experts study and propose new TB vaccines to supplement the BCG vaccine, an important consideration is the age at which these new vaccines should be administered to high-risk populations.

Now, a new study led by a Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researcher provides new insight and clarity on these issues.

Published in The Lancet Global Health, the study found that BCG vaccination at birth does provide significant protection against TB disease -- but only among children under 5 years old. The vaccine provided no protection among adolescents or adults in this study.

These results suggest that protectiveness from the BCG vaccine may begin to wane as children get older and, thus, children over 10 years old and adults should receive a booster BCG vaccine -- and eventually a new, supplemental vaccine, as the researchers note that the BCG booster may also have limited efficacy -- for immunity against TB beyond childhood. Unfortunately, a BCG booster has limited efficacy, so new vaccines are needed.

""Unlike many of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which we know are highly effective, there is widespread debate on the BCG vaccine's effectiveness and duration of protection, as well as whether the vaccine only works in selective settings,"" says study lead author Dr. Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. ""Our findings indicate that BCG vaccination is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children. Since tuberculosis in children is a highly debilitating and severe disease, BCG vaccination should continue to be used.""

However, since the results show that the vaccine was ineffective in adolescents and adults, ""boosting immunoprotection is needed for older populations,"" Martinez says. ""Novel vaccines are urgently needed to supplement BCG vaccination in high-burden settings.""

These findings provide up-to-date assessments on TB vaccine effectiveness, as the majority of previously published studies on this subject were conducted more than 50 years ago, with varying results, and primarily in settings with a relatively low burden of the disease. This new analysis presents data over the past 10 years, from high-burden settings in 17 countries, including South Africa, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Uganda, The Gambia, and Brazil.

For the study, Martinez and colleagues analyzed individual-level data from 26 longitudinal studies that included nearly 70,000 participants exposed to TB from 1998 to 2018. The researchers examined the impact of BCG vaccination for all TB disease, as well as specifically for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. The analysis examined variability across the studies, including the use of skin and blood TB infection tests, and accounted for potentially confounding factors such as HIV, exposure status, and history of prior TB, amongst others.

Among all children under 5 years old, BCG vaccination was 37 percent effective. The researchers did not find conclusive evidence that the vaccine was protective among children over 10 or among adults. When focusing only on pulmonary TB, BCG vaccination was 19 percent effective, however this effect was also only among young children.

Although the BCG vaccine is not widely administered in the United States, Martinez says that this new information lends important implications for the US and other wealthy countries.

""The vast majority of tuberculosis in the US and other high-income countries occurs in immigrants who recently traveled to the US from settings with a high burden of tuberculosis,"" he says. ""Several cost-effectiveness and mathematical modeling studies have found that devoting resources to countries with a high burden of tuberculosis outside the US is amongst the most effective intervention to control tuberculosis inside the US. So although our results are mostly in settings with a high burden of tuberculosis, they are also relevant to low-burden settings.""

The researchers stress that substantial investment in TB vaccine development is critical to controlling global TB.

""We urgently need vaccines that are effective against TB in adults,"" says study coauthor Dr. C. Robert Horsburgh, professor of epidemiology. ""There are a number of promising TB vaccine candidates under study and we hope that one or more of them will prove effective.""",0

When ice on land slides into the ocean, it displaces ocean water and causes sea level to rise. People believe that when this floating ice melts, water level doesn't rise an additional amount because the freshwater ice displaces the same volume of water as it would contribute once it melts. Similarly, people also think that when ocean water freezes to form sea ice and then melts, the water is merely going through a change of state, so it won't affect sea level. However, in a visit to NSIDC in May, Dr. Peter Noerdlinger, a professor at St. Mary's University in Nova Scotia, Canada, suggested otherwise.In a paper titled ""The Melting of Floating Ice will Raise the Ocean Level"" submitted to Geophysical Journal International, Noerdlinger demonstrates that melt water from sea ice and floating ice shelves could add 2.6% more water to the ocean than the water displaced by the ice, or the equivalent of approximately 4 centimeters (1.57 inches) of sea-level rise.The common misconception that floating ice won't increase sea level when it melts occurs because the difference in density between fresh water and salt water is not taken into consideration. Archimedes' Principle states that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. However, Noerdlinger notes that because freshwater is not as dense as saltwater, freshwater actually has greater volume than an equivalent weight of saltwater. Thus, when freshwater ice melts in the ocean, it contributes a greater volume of melt water than it originally displaced.

1012,"ROCHESTER, Minn. – Mayo Clinic announced today that its Rochester campus is one of 16 cancer centers nationally selected to provide chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T-cell therapy) for adults with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who have not responded to, or have relapsed, after two or more lines of treatment. The therapy, called axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), is approved to treat subtypes of lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arising from follicular lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.

“CAR T-cell therapy is a cell-based regenerative immunotherapy, and it is one of the most promising new areas of cancer treatment,” says Yi Lin, M.D., Ph.D., a hematologist and chair of the Cellular Therapeutics Cross-Disciplinary Group at Mayo Clinic. “This therapy uses genetically modified versions of a patient’s own immune cells to fight their cancer. I like to describe these modified T-cells as super RoboCops designed to seek out and destroy a particular cancer.”

CAR T-cell therapy begins by collecting a patient’s white blood cells (T-cells) and sending them to a central manufacturing facility where they are genetically modified to direct them against a patient’s cancer. Once processed, the CAR T-cells are frozen and sent back to the hospital for IV infusion back into the patient.

Before the patients receives their CAR T-cells, they undergo a short chemotherapy regimen to condition their body to receive the cells. Once infused, the CAR T-cells proliferate inside the body, and begin to recognize and attack cancer cells.

Mayo Clinic has successfully participated in CAR T-cell clinical trials with Kite (a Gilead company) and other manufacturers of T-cell therapies. “As one of the first treatment centers in the country, patients will be under the care of a team of experts trained in CAR T-cell therapy for cancer treatment,” Dr. Lin says.

Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arising from follicular lymphoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to, or have relapsed, after two or more lines of treatment and are interested in CAR T-cell therapy may contact the Mayo Clinic Hematology Patient Appointment office at 507-284-5363 to request an appointment for evaluation and assessment for eligibility for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. In the future, Mayo Clinic plans to offer chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma at its campuses in Arizona and Florida.

The study findings, published Oct. 25 in Nature Communications, suggest exposure to specific chemicals within e-cigarette liquids (e-liquids) promote arrhythmias and cardiac electrical dysfunction.

""Our findings demonstrate that short-term exposure to e-cigarettes can destabilize heart rhythm through specific chemicals within e-liquids,"" said Alex Carll, assistant professor in the UofL Department of Physiology who led the study. ""These findings suggest that e-cigarette use involving certain flavors or solvent vehicles may disrupt the heart's electrical conduction and provoke arrhythmias. These effects could increase the risk for atrial or ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest.""

The researchers tested the cardiac impacts of inhaled e-cigarette aerosols solely from the main two ingredients in e-liquids (nicotine-free propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin) or from flavored retail e-liquids containing nicotine. They found that for all e-cigarette aerosols, the animals' heart rate slowed during puff exposures and sped up afterwards as heart rate variability declined, indicating fight-or-flight stress responses. In addition, e-cigarette puffs from a menthol-flavored e-liquid or from propylene glycol alone caused ventricular arrhythmias and other conduction irregularities in the heart.

Conducted in collaboration with Daniel Conklin and Aruni Bhatnagar, professors in the UofL Division of Environmental Medicine, this work adds to a growing body of research on the potential toxicity and health impacts of e-cigarettes reported by the American Heart Association Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center, for which UofL serves as the flagship institute.

""The findings of this study are important because they provide fresh evidence that the use of e-cigarettes could interfere with normal heart rhythms -- something we did not know before,"" Bhatnagar said. ""This is highly concerning given the rapid growth of e-cigarette use, particularly among young people.""

As e-cigarette use has grown nationwide, the potential advantages and harms of vaping have been debated. Since vaping does not involve combustion, it exposes users and bystanders to little if any carbon monoxide, tar or cancer-causing nitrosamines compared with conventional cigarettes. However, e-cigarettes can deliver aldehydes, particles and nicotine at levels comparable to combustible cigarettes. Vaping might help smokers quit combustible cigarettes, but the appeal and addictiveness of e-cigarettes may encourage youth to vape amidst unknown long-term risks or take up smoking. More than 25% of high schoolers and 10% of middle schoolers in the U.S. reported using e-cigarettes before the pandemic.

Additional research by Carll and Matthew Nystoriak, an associate professor of medicine at UofL, to determine the effects of vape flavorings on the heart recently received $3.6 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health.

""Our team's findings that specific ingredients in e-cigarette liquids promote arrhythmias indicates there is an urgent need for more research into the cardiac effects of these components in both animals and humans,"" Carll said.",0

So far in England and Wales, there have been two periods during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic when weekly and monthly registrations of deaths from all causes were consistently higher than the five-year average - also known as 'excess deaths.'
Using weekly data, the first period was from the week ending 20 March to the week ending 12 June 2020 and the second was from the week ending 11 September 2020 to the week ending 5 March 2021. Using monthly data, the periods above average were from March to July 2020 and then from September 2020 to March 2021.
Excess deaths are the clearest way to compare the likely impact of the pandemic over time, because a substantial number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths were recorded early in the pandemic, in March and April 2020. One reason for excess deaths could be that COVID-19 was undiagnosed.

1019,"An infant's odd case of rare encephalitis not typically found in children led researchers to discover never before seen genetic mutations and a more accurate technique to examine the IRAK4 gene responsible for innate immunity.

The IRAK4 gene instructs the production of a protein that plays a key role in the early recognition and response to invading pathogens. Inherited mutations in this gene can cause an immune system disorder that leaves the body susceptible to recurrent infections of pus-forming pyogenic bacteria. Cases of IRAK4 deficiency are quite rare and only about 10 familial instances were identified so far in Japan.

A Hiroshima University-led research team detected two novel IRAK4 mutations, c.29_30delAT (p.Y10Cfs*9) and c.35G>C (p.R12P), in a 10-month-old boy with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) reactivation. The p.Y10Cfs*9 and p.R12P variations were inherited from his father and mother, respectively. The research team found the mutations by using whole exome sequencing (WES), a method used to exhaustively examine the DNA for genetic disorders.

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, happens when the immune system attacks a vital brain receptor, causing psychiatric symptoms, involuntary movement, seizures, autonomic dysfunction, and central hypoventilation. It typically occurs in adult females suffering from ovarian tumor. Only a few cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis have been so far reported in infants.

The researchers suspect that reactivation of HHV6 may have induced brain damage that triggered the production of anti-NMDAR antibodies.

""It is well known that anti-NMDAR encephalitis is triggered by HSV1 (herpes simplex virus) infection. The post-infectious autoimmune process that follows the HSV-induced brain damage is thought to be the cause of anti-NMDAR encephalitis,"" the researchers said in their study published in the Journal of Clinical Immunology.

""The coexistence of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and HHV6 reactivation in this patient may reveal an unknown manifestation associated with IRAK4 deficiency,"" they said.

Although the researchers have yet to find direct evidence demonstrating a relationship between IRAK4 deficiency and the development of anti-NMDAR encephalitis or HHV6 reactivation, they were able to establish that mutations p.Y10Cfs*9 and p.R12P are damaging.

The researchers developed a novel NF-κB reporter assay that can precisely evaluate whether an IRAK4 mutation is harmful. The reporter assay allows them to investigate the activation of transcription factor NF-κB which regulates the body's inflammatory responses.

""Using this system, we confirmed that both novel mutations are deleterious. The current case revealed the possibility that genetics can contribute to characterizing infantile cases with anti-NMDAR encephalitis,"" study author Satoshi Okada, a professor at HU's Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, said.

They resolved potential issues of misevaluation in a previously developed NF-κB reporter assay by using CRISPR gene-editing technology to remove the IRAK4 naturally expressed in the HEK293 cell -- commonly used in studying gene function as it is much easier to transfect than other cell lines.

""HEK293 cells have endogenous IRAK4 expression. Their endogenous IRAK4 prevents the precise evaluation of the activity of introduced WT or mutant IRAK4,"" Okada explained.

To date, there are so far 24 known mutations identified in patients with IRAK4 deficiency.

The research team hopes to soon introduce their novel NF-κB reporter assay system to help evaluate IRAK4 gene mutations and achieve early diagnosis.",0

1025,"Conception within three months of a miscarriage or an abortion is not associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, according to new research publishing November 22 in the open access journal PLOS Medicine. The study suggests that, contrary to current advice, women could attempt pregnancy after a previous miscarriage or induced abortion without elevated perinatal risks and reassures those who want to try again sooner than guidelines recommend.

The World Health Organization recommends waiting six months after miscarriage or abortion before becoming pregnant again to avoid complications in the next pregnancy, yet evidence for this is scarce. Gizachew Tessema of the Curtin School of Population Health, Australia, and colleagues conducted a cohort study with a total of 49,058 births following miscarriage and 23,707 births following abortion in Norway between 2008-2016. They looked at six adverse outcomes: preterm birth, spontaneous preterm birth, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.

Compared with waiting 6-11 months after miscarriage, there were lower risks of small for gestational age for babies conceived in less than six months and a lower risk of gestational diabetes in women conceiving in under three months. Following abortion there was a slight but non-significant increased risk of small for gestational age for conception in less than three months compared with 6-11 months but the risk of large for gestational age was lower in the group with an interpregnancy interval of 3-5 months.

There was no evidence of higher risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with an IPI of greater than 12 months after miscarriages or induced abortions, with the exception of a modest increased risk of gestational diabetes. The authors acknowledge that the study was limited in that it lacked information on potential confounders, including pregnancy intention and health seeking behavior. Additionally, the data only included miscarriages recorded through the healthcare system.

The findings do not support current guidelines to wait six months after miscarriage or abortion, and suggest a need to review these guidelines and provide up to date, evidence based, recommendations for women.

The authors add, ""Based on this study and others, we called for a review of the existing World Health Organization recommendations for pregnancy spacing following pregnancy loss.""",0

1032,"Mount Sinai researchers have published one of the first studies to associate changes in blood gene expression during COVID-19 with the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as ""long COVID,"" in patients more than a year after they were hospitalized with severe COVID-19.

The findings, published in Nature Medicine on December 8, highlight the need for greater attention at the infection stage to better understand how the processes that begin then eventually lead to long COVID, which could help improve both prevention strategies and treatment options for COVID-19 survivors experiencing persistent symptoms after infection.

The research team identified, among other findings, two molecularly distinct subsets of long COVID symptoms with opposing gene expression patterns during acute COVID-19 in plasma cells, the immune system's antibody-producing cells. In patients who went on to develop lung problems, antibody production genes were less abundant. However, for patients with other symptoms such as the loss of smell or taste and sleep disruptions, the same antibody production genes were more abundant instead. These opposing patterns observed in the same cells, as well as additional unique patterns observed in other cell types, point to the existence of multiple independent processes leading to different long COVID symptoms; these processes are already present during the acute infection.

""Our findings show that molecular processes leading to long COVID are already detectable during COVID-19 infection,"" said senior author Noam D. Beckmann, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine (Data Driven and Digital Medicine) and Associate Director of Data Science Strategy at The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Furthermore, we see the start of multiple molecularly distinct paths leading to long COVID, providing a unique viewpoint into differences between long-term symptoms.""

Using the Mount Sinai COVID-19 Biobank, the researchers examined gene expression data in blood samples from more than 500 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between April and June 2020. More than 160 of these patients provided self-reported assessments of symptoms still present six months or more after hospitalization. The team tested each gene expressed in the blood for association with each long COVID symptom, accounting for ICU admission, COVID-19 severity during hospitalization, sex, age, and other variables. The team then tested for associations specific to each of 13 different types of immune cells, including plasma cells. Finally, these associations were categorized by whether they matched up with changes in patients' levels of antibodies specific to the virus.

""For long COVID symptoms, like smell or taste problems, connecting antibody gene expression in plasma cells with the actual levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein demonstrates a direct link to the body's response to the virus,"" said lead author Ryan C. Thompson, PhD, Data Science Analyst at The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine. ""On the other hand, the gene expression pattern for lung problems does not match up with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels, highlighting the different immune processes leading to long COVID that are triggered by COVID-19.""

The team said long COVID still remains poorly defined and future studies should take the initial stage of infection into account to more comprehensively characterize the molecular processes of long COVID and identify biomarkers that can help predict, treat, and prevent prolonged symptoms.

""Our findings show there is the potential to use data from the infection stage to predict what might happen to the patient months later,"" said co-corresponding author Alexander W. Charney, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and Co-Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine. ""We should not ignore the infection phase in research on long COVID -- this is clearly a critical window of time where the body's response to SARS-CoV-2 might be setting the stage for what is to come.""

1035,"An Australian nation-wide population-based follow-up study published in the Journal of Dental Research (JDR) has provided evidence that exposure to fluoridated water by young children was not negatively associated with child emotional, behavioral development and executive functioning in their adolescent years.

The study by Professor Loc Do of the University of Queensland Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Dentistry and colleagues examined the effect of early childhood exposures to water fluoridation on measures of school-age executive functioning and emotional and behavioral development in a population-based sample. This longitudinal follow-up study used information from Australia's National Child Oral Health Study of 2012-14. Children aged 5-10 years at the baseline were contacted again after 7-8 years, before they had turned 18 years of age.

Percent lifetime exposed to fluoridated water (%LEFW) from birth to the age of five years was estimated from residential history and postcode-level fluoride levels in public tap water. Measures of children's emotional and behavioral development were assessed by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and executive functioning was measured by the Behavior Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF). Multivariable regression models were generated to compare the associations between the exposure and the primary outcomes, controlled for covariates. An equivalence test was also conducted to compare the primary outcomes of those who had 100%LEFW against those with 0%LEFW.

Sensitivity analysis was also conducted. A total of 2,682 children completed SDQ and BRIEF, with mean scores of 7.0 (95%CI: 6.6, 7.4) and 45.3 (44.7, 45.8), respectively. Those with lower %LEFW tended to have poorer scores on the SDQ and BRIEF. Multivariable regression models reported no association between exposure to fluoridated water and the SDQ and BRIEF scores. Low household income, identifying as Indigenous, and having a neurodevelopmental diagnosis were associated with poorer SDQ/BRIEF scores.

The study concluded that exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning. Children who had been exposed to fluoridated water for their whole early childhood had their measures of emotional, behavioral development and executive functioning at least equivalent to that of children who had no exposure to fluoridated water.

1037,"While immune cells called neutrophils are known to act as infantry in the body’s war on germs, a National Institutes of Health-funded study suggests they can act as medics as well. By studying rodents, researchers showed that instead of attacking germs, some neutrophils may help heal the brain after an intracerebral hemorrhage, a form of stroke caused by ruptured blood vessels. The study suggests that two neutrophil-related proteins may play critical roles in protecting the brain from stroke-induced damage and could be used as treatments for intracerebral hemorrhage.

“Intracerebral hemorrhage is a damaging and often fatal form of stroke for which there are no effective medicines,” said Jaroslaw Aronowski, M.D., Ph.D., professor, department of neurology, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and senior author of the study published in Nature Communications. “Our results are a hopeful first step towards developing a treatment for this devastating form of stroke.”

Accounting for 10 to 15 percent of all strokes, intracerebral hemorrhages happen when blood vessels rupture and leak blood into the brain, often leading to death or long-term disability. Chronic high blood pressure is the leading risk factor for these types of strokes. The initial phase of damage appears to be caused by the pressure of blood leaking into the brain. Over time, further damage may be caused by the accumulation of toxic levels of blood products, infiltrating immune cells, and swelling.

Decades of research suggest that neutrophils are some of the earliest immune cells to respond to a hemorrhage, and that they may both harm and heal the brain. In this study, the researchers found that interleukin-27 (IL-27), a protein that controls the activity of immune cells, may shift the role of neutrophils from harming the brain to helping with recovery.

Injections of IL-27 after a hemorrhage helped mice recover. Days after the strokes, the treated mice had better mobility, including walking, limb stretching and navigating holes in a floor. In contrast, injections of an antibody that blocked natural IL-27 activity slowed recovery. The brains of the mice treated with IL-27 also showed less damage. They had less swelling around the hemorrhages and lower levels of iron and the blood protein hemoglobin, both of which are toxic at high levels.

“This study shines a spotlight on the critical role the immune system may play in helping the brain heal after a hemorrhage or stroke and opens new avenues for stroke treatment strategies,” said Jim Koenig, Ph.D., program director at the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Neutrophils are born in bone marrow and carry chemicals in hundreds of densely filled packets called granules, which look like dark spots under a microscope. Typically, when the body senses bacteria or an injury, neutrophils rush to the invasion site and release germ killing chemicals from the granules. This appears to happen minutes after a hemorrhagic stroke.

In this study, the researchers suggested that after a hemorrhagic stroke the brain secretes high levels of IL-27, which leads to a second wave of neutrophils arriving with granules filled with higher amounts of healing molecules. IL-27 levels were elevated in the brain and blood of the mice an hour after hemorrhages and stayed high for three days, peaking at 24 hours later. Further experiments suggested that brain cells called microglia produced the IL-27 in response to the presence of red blood cells.

Once released, IL-27 molecules appeared to travel to the bones of the mice, infiltrated the marrow, and changed the role newborn neutrophils played in response to a stroke. When the researchers extracted newborn neutrophils from the bones of mice and treated them with IL-27, the chemical raised the activity of genes associated with healing, especially lactoferrin, while reducing the activity of genes associated with killing cells. Conversely, treating mice with an IL-27 neutralizing antibody after a hemorrhage lowered lactoferrin gene activity.

“Our results suggested that IL-27 links the brain to the bones,” said Dr. Aronowski. “We can use these results as a source for ideas for developing potential treatments for hemorrhagic stroke.”

Finally, the researchers showed the iron binding protein lactoferrin may protect the brain from intracerebral hemorrhagic strokes. Mice and rats injected with lactoferrin 30 minutes after hemorrhages recovered faster and had reduced brain damage as compared to animals given placebos. In one set of experiments, the researchers found that giving mice lactoferrin 24 hours after a stroke was also effective.

“Lactoferrin appears to have a long treatment window,” said Dr. Aronowski. “This means lactoferrin might one day be used to help patients recover from intracerebral hemorrhage.”

Dr. Aronowski’s team is taking the next steps towards testing lactoferrin treatment in patients.

1040,"New tool that uses DNA sequencing could improve transplant outcomes and save lives.

Researchers have developed a simple blood test that can detect when a newly transplanted lung is being rejected by a patient, even when no outward signs of the rejection are evident. The test could make it possible for doctors to intervene faster to prevent or slow down so-called chronic rejection—which is severe, irreversible, and often deadly—in those first critical months after lung transplantation. Researchers believe this same test might also be useful for monitoring rejection in other types of organ transplants. The work was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The study’s findings were published Jan. 22 in EBioMedicine, a publication of The Lancet.

“This test solves a long-standing problem in lung transplants: detection of hidden signs of rejection,” said Hannah Valantine, M.D., co-leader of the study and lead investigator of the Laboratory of Organ Transplant Genomics in the Cardiovascular Branch at NHLBI. “We’re very excited about its potential to save lives, especially in the wake of a critical shortage of donor organs.”

The test relies on DNA sequencing, Valantine explained, and as such, represents a great example of personalized medicine, as it will allow doctors to tailor transplant treatments to those individuals who are at highest risk for rejection.

Lung transplant recipients have the shortest survival rates among patients who get solid organ transplantation of any kind—only about half live past five years. Lung transplant recipients face a high incidence of chronic rejection, which occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the transplanted organ. Existing tools for detecting signs of rejection, such as biopsy, either require the removal of small amounts of lung tissue or are not sensitive enough to discern the severity of the rejection. The new test appears to overcome those challenges.

Called the donor-derived cell-free DNA test, the experimental test begins with obtaining a few blood droplets taken from the arm of the transplant recipient. A special set of machines then sorts the DNA fragments in the blood sample, and in combination with computer analysis, determines whether the fragments are from the recipient or the donor and how many of each type are present. Because injured or dying cells from the donor release lots of donor DNA fragments into the bloodstream compared to normal donor cells, higher amounts of donor DNA indicate a higher risk for transplant rejection in the recipient.

In the study, 106 lung transplant recipients were enrolled and monitored. Blood samples collected in the first three months after transplantation underwent the testing procedure. The results showed that those with higher levels of the donor-derived DNA fragments in the first three months of transplantation were six times more likely to subsequently develop transplant organ failure or die during the study follow-up period than those with lower donor-derived DNA levels. Importantly, researchers found that more than half of the high-risk subjects showed no outward signs of clinical complications during this period.



 “We showed for the first time that donor-derived DNA is a predictive marker for chronic lung rejection and death, and could provide critical time-points to intervene, perhaps preventing these outcomes,” Valantine said. “Once rejection is detected early via this test, doctors would then have the option to increase the dosages of anti-rejection drugs, add new agents that reduce tissue inflammation, or take other measures to prevent or slow the progression.”

In 2010, Valantine was part of a research team that pioneered the first blood test to diagnose organ rejection. The now-widely used test, called the AlloMap, analyzes the expression of 20 genes in a transplant recipient’s blood sample to determine whether the patient’s immune system is launching an attack. The following year, Valantine and her colleagues showed for the first time that a cell-free DNA blood test could be useful for monitoring early signs of rejection. However, those early studies of the cell-free DNA test only identified signs of “acute” transplant rejection, which is easily reversed. The current study shows that high cell-free DNA levels during the first three months after transplant predicts chronic rejection. If validated, this blood test could become a routine tool used to monitor transplant patients at very early stages of rejection, the researchers said.

1041,"Fewer people are dying from cardiovascular disease in the U.S., according to new research from the University of Georgia. But rural counties and those with a higher percentage of Black residents consistently experienced higher rates of cardiovascular disease than urban and more predominantly white counties.

Published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the study showed that deaths from heart disease consistently declined at the county level from 2009 to 2018.

""Even though the rates of cardiovascular disease are decreasing, the gaps between rural and urban health and counties with more Black residents are not decreasing,"" said Heejung Son, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the College of Public Health. ""The main point of our study is that we need to try to find ways to reduce those gaps.""

The researchers relied on data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that covered more than 3,100 counties across the country.

The agency's annual survey is designed to understand the relationship between community-level factors such as demographics or socioeconomic status of communities, access to quality health care and emerging health issues like cardiovascular disease or obesity.

The researchers found that factors such as food insecurity and housing instability also played a large role in counties with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death. Deaths from heart disease were significantly lower in counties with higher household income levels and in areas where more individuals had Medicare coverage.

Previous research has shown that chronic stress caused by low wages can create inflammation in the body that leads to illness, which may explain the connection between low socioeconomic status and higher rates of death by cardiovascular disease, the researchers said.

""The environment that we are born, live and grow in has an effect on our health,"" said Zhuo ""Adam"" Chen, co-author of the study and an associate professor of health policy and management. Chen also serves as co-chair of the College of Public Health's health disparities research working group. ""Social factors, such as those that affect our income, housing conditions and transportation -- people may not make the connection that those things affect our health as well.""

The study also showed that cardiovascular disease caused more deaths in counties where more residents lived in mobile homes, relied on food stamps (or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or had only a high school education.

Increasing access to health care would be a great start to closing the cardiovascular health disparities, and making food stamps more available could help too.

""We need to be thinking outside of the box,"" Chen said. ""This study presents evidence for stronger interventions related to housing, income support and food security. We need to be proactive instead of waiting for people to get sick to provide medical care.""

This antibiotic may be a strong candidate for further consideration as a therapeutic drug for JE patients. Treatment with minocycline also improves behavioral outcomes following JE. The vaccine for JE is made by Central Research Institute but transporting it to rural and remote areas is logistically difficult, while minocycline is easily available and inexpensive even in remote areas. The Department of Biotechnology is considering a clinical trial for using minocycline for JE patients.",1
1043,"A recent study found that a Medicaid program in Colorado can help address the shortage of home healthcare workers for children with complex medical needs by offering family members certified nursing assistant (CNA) training and paying them for at-home medical care their child requires. Results show that children who received family-CNA care were not more likely to be hospitalized than children cared for by a non-family CNA. Children with family-CNA caregivers also experienced greater care continuity since turnover was not an issue as it tends to be with traditional home healthcare workers. Findings were published in the Journal of Pediatrics.

There is a general shortage of healthcare workers nationally across the board, which worsened with the COVID pandemic. The shortage of home healthcare workers has been an even longer standing concern and often drives families to leave a job or reduce work hours to care for their child with complex medical needs. In addition to the financial burden on families, the lack of professional home healthcare services can lead to unnecessarily prolonged hospitalizations and institutionalization.

Some states allow non-parent family members, such as grandparents, to be paid to provide care. But most states do not allow parent guardians to be paid to provide medical care to their children, except for some select programs that make exceptions for parents who are registered nurses (RNs) or licensed practical nurses (LPNs). Illinois Medicaid has committed to finding alternative ways for parents to be paid caregivers and is exploring ways for that to be implemented.

""Our study provides evidence that paid family caregiving as a concept is feasible and can be successfully applied to meet the home care needs of children with medical complexity,"" said lead author Carolyn Foster, MD, MS, from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""States should consider adopting policies that promote avenues to allow for parents to obtain CNA or other relevant credentials and to be paid for their child's at-home medical care. Such policies would enable state programs to meet their legal obligation to provide medical services for enrolled children while also reducing family financial strain and providing care continuity for these children.""

Dr. Foster and colleagues stress that according to previous research, care continuity results in higher quality care. Broader literature also demonstrates cost savings to the health system with reduced employee turnover. The lack of costs for re-training and onboarding employees may be a source of savings in family CNA programs.

The study compared the characteristics and healthcare utilization of children with medical complexity who received paid CNA care by a family member and by a traditional non-family CNA from 2017 to 2019, as part of the Medicaid program in Colorado. Researchers analyzed de-identified billing claims data for 861 children, including information such as hospitalization frequency and hospital lengths of stay.

""Colorado's family-centered model addresses the significant shortage of healthcare workforce while providing additional income to parents who are compelled to leave work to care for their children. This program may not be a fit for all situations but is a meaningful option for many children going without enough services,"" said Dr. Foster.

Research at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago is conducted through Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute. The Manne Research Institute is focused on improving child health, transforming pediatric medicine and ensuring healthier futures through the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Lurie Children's is ranked as one of the nation's top children's hospitals by U.S. News & World Report.

1044,"In a study published in Autophagy, researchers at the University of Maryland (UMD) shed new light on how Zika virus hijacks our own cellular machinery to break down a protein that is essential for neurological development and cellular communication, getting it to ""eat itself."" By triggering this process known as autophagy, Zika virus is able to degrade an important protein, a process that may contribute to the development of neurological or brain deficiencies and congenital birth defects in the newborns of infected pregnant women. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of how this process takes place, researchers are coming closer to developing therapeutic interventions to prevent congenital birth defects such as microcephaly caused by Zika virus infection in pregnant mothers.

""The Zika virus is able to disrupt our cellular mechanisms to create a conducive environment to replicate,"" explains Yanjin Zhang, associate professor in Veterinary Medicine at UMD. ""It upregulates some proteins and downregulates others that have antiviral roles, manipulating and interfering with cells to its own advantage. In this case, it looks like the KPNA2 protein may have some antiviral effects, so the virus uses the natural cellular self-destruction process called autophagy, or self-eating, to get rid of KPNA2.""

The human body is full of mechanisms to move information and equipment like proteins around, or clear out unnecessary equipment through self-destruct processes like autophagy. In autophagy, cellular components like proteins are marked as damaged, essentially triggering the cell to eat itself to recycle vital ingredients for cell regeneration. However, in this case, the Zika virus wants the protein KPNA2 destroyed for its own benefit.

""Researchers knew that KPNA2 has important roles in transporting proteins, but we didn't know the mechanism of its turnover until now,"" says Zhang. ""KPNA2 is known to transport important cellular factors needed for development, growth, and cell differentiation during neurological or brain development.""

Since Zika virus is known to cause infection in pregnant women that can lead to brain deficiencies and congenital defects like microcephaly (a birth defect leading to smaller head and brain size) in newborns, the fact that it degrades this particular protein is important to understanding the development of these defects.

Zika virus is a globally mosquito-transmitted virus that has been identified in 87 countries and territories as of 2019 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While no cases have been reported in the United States in the last few years, the WHO reports a suspected total of over 30,000 cases in the Americas alone in 2018. After the Zika virus epidemic in 2015-2016, the health risk for pregnant mothers and congenital birth defects in newborns became a major public health concern.

""Zika virus is more of an issue internationally than locally right now,"" says Zhang, ""but as we can see with COVID-19, a global disease can easily become a local concern. Nowadays, it is so easy to travel from one continent to another, and with commercial trade, everything is interlinked. Vectors like mosquitoes can be carried across the world and open new pathways of transmission.""

The changing climate also plays a role in the spread of infectious diseases like this, explains Zhang. ""This is vector-borne or mosquito-borne disease, and as the climate changes, the mosquitoes can reproduce more, and can move farther north and into other areas they may not have been before.""

Zhang is hopeful, however, that his work will help lead to therapeutic options that can help prevent birth defects caused by Zika virus infection. ""Understanding this mechanism is an important step towards understanding how to control the effects of Zika virus, including congenital birth defects,"" says Zhang.",0

1048,"A new study by scientists from The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and other institutions suggests a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

""Our work supports a common theme whereby loss of protein stability leads to disease,"" said John A. Tainer, professor of structural biology at TSRI and senior scientist at Berkeley Lab, who shared senior authorship of the new research with TSRI Professor Elizabeth Getzoff.

Getzoff, Tainer and their colleagues, who focused on the effects of mutations to a gene coding for a protein called superoxide dismutase (SOD), report their findings this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study provides evidence that those proteins linked to more severe forms of the disease are less stable structurally and more prone to form clusters or aggregates.

""The suggestion here is that strategies for stabilizing SOD proteins could be useful in treating or preventing SOD-linked ALS,"" said Getzoff.

Striking in the Prime of Life

ALS is notorious for its ability to strike down people in the prime of life. It first leapt into public consciousness when it afflicted baseball star Lou Gehrig, who succumbed to the disease in 1941 at the age of only 38. Recently, the ALS Association's Ice Bucket Challenge has enhanced public awareness of the disease.

ALS kills by destroying muscle-controlling neurons, ultimately including those that control breathing. At any one time, about 10,000 Americans are living with the disease, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it is almost always lethal within several years of the onset of symptoms.

SOD1 mutations, the most studied factors in ALS, are found in about a quarter of hereditary ALS cases and seven percent of ordinary ""sporadic"" ALS cases. SOD-linked ALS has nearly 200 variants, each associated with a distinct SOD1 mutation. Scientists still don't agree, though, on just how the dozens of different SOD1 mutations all lead to the same disease.

One feature that SOD1-linked forms of ALS do have in common is the appearance of SOD clusters or aggregates in affected motor neurons and their support cells. Aggregates of SOD with other proteins are also found in affected cells, even in ALS cases that are not linked to SOD1 mutations.

In 2003, based on their and others' studies of mutant SOD proteins, Tainer, Getzoff and their colleagues proposed the ""framework destabilization"" hypothesis. In this view, ALS-linked mutant SOD1 genes all code for structurally unstable forms of the SOD protein. Inevitably some of these unstable SOD proteins lose their normal folding enough to expose sticky elements that are normally kept hidden, and they begin to aggregate with one another, faster than neuronal cleanup systems can keep up -- and that accumulating SOD aggregation somehow triggers disease.

In the new study, the Tainer and Getzoff laboratories and their collaborators used advanced biophysical methods to probe how different SOD1 gene mutations in a particular genetic ALS ""hotspot"" affect SOD protein stability.

To start, they examined how the aggregation dynamics of the best-studied mutant form of SOD, known as SOD G93A, differed from that of non-mutant, ""wild-type"" SOD. To do this, they developed a method for gradually inducing SOD aggregation, which was measured with an innovative structural imaging system called SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) at Berkeley Lab's SIBYLS beamline.

""We could detect differences between the two proteins even before we accelerated the aggregation process,"" said David S. Shin, a research scientist in Tainer's laboratories at Berkeley Lab and TSRI who continues structural work on SOD at Berkeley.

The G93A SOD aggregated more quickly than wild-type SOD, but more slowly than an SOD mutant called A4V that is associated with a more rapidly progressing form of ALS.

Subsequent experiments with G93A and five other G93 mutants (in which the amino acid glycine at position 93 on the protein is replaced with a different amino acid) revealed that the mutants formed long, rod-shaped aggregates, compared to the compact folded structure of wild-type SOD. The mutant SOD proteins that more quickly formed longer aggregates were again those that corresponded to more rapidly progressing forms of ALS.

What could explain these SOD mutants' diminished stability? Further tests focused on the role of a copper ion that is normally incorporated within the SOD structure and helps stabilize the protein. Using two other techniques, electron-spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the researchers found that the G93-mutant SODs seemed normal in their ability to take up copper ions, but had a reduced ability to retain copper under mildly stressing conditions -- and this ability was lower for the SOD mutants associated with more severe ALS.

""There were indications that the mutant SODs are more flexible than wild-type SOD, and we think that explains their relative inability to retain the copper ions,"" said Ashley J. Pratt, the first author of the study, who was a student in the Getzoff laboratory and postdoctoral fellow with Tainer at Berkeley Lab.

In short, the G93-mutant SODs appear to have looser, floppier structures that are more likely to drop their copper ions -- and thus are more likely to misfold and stick together in aggregates.

Along with other researchers in the field, Getzoff and Tainer suspect that deviant interactions of mutant SOD trigger inflammation and disrupt ordinary protein trafficking and disposal systems, stressing and ultimately killing affected neurons.

""Because mutant SODs get bent out of shape more easily,"" said Getzoff, ""they don't hold and release their protein partners properly. By defining these defective partnerships, we can provide new targets for the development of drugs to treat ALS.""

The researchers also plan to confirm the relationship between structural stability and ALS severity in other SOD mutants.

""If our hypothesis is correct,"" said Shin, ""future therapies to treat SOD-linked ALS need not be tailored to each individual mutation -- they should be applicable to all of them.""",0

1050,"July 27, 2022 -- Scientists seeking to keep ahead of the evolving coronavirus are looking at new strategies, including developing nasal vaccines. The Biden administration held a summit on the future of COVID-19 vaccines, inviting researchers to provide a public update on efforts to try to keep ahead of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Scientists and federal officials are looking to build on the successes seen in developing the original crop of COVID vaccines, which were authorized for use in the United States less than a year after the pandemic took hold. But new variants are eating away at these gains. Officials at the CDC FDA have been keeping an eye for months on how the level of effectiveness of COVID vaccines has waned during the rise of the Omicron strain. And there’s continual concern about how COVID-19 might evolve over time. “Our vaccines are terrific,” said Ashish K. Jha, MD, the White House’s COVID-19 response coordinator, at the summit. But “we have to do better.” Among the approaches being considered are vaccines that would be applied intranasally, with the idea that this might be able to boost the immune response toCOVID-19. At the summit, Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, of Yale University, said the intranasal approach might be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus as well as reducing illness severity for those who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. “We're stopping the virus from spreading right at the border,” Iwasaki said at the summit. “This is akin to putting a guard outside of the house in order to patrol for invaders compared to putting the guards in the hallway of the building in the hope that they capture the invader.” Iwasaki is one of the founders of created last year to focus on ways to kill SARS-CoV-2 in the nasosinus before it spreads deeper into the respiratory tract. In a July 21 editorial in Science Immunology, Iwasaki and Eric J. Topol, MD, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, encouraged more federal investment in this approach to fighting SARS-CoV-2. (Topol is editor-in-chief of Medscape.)

Titled “Operation Nasal Vaccine—Lightning speed to counter COVID-19,” their editorial noted the “unprecedented success” seen in the rapid development of the first two mRNA shots. Iwasaki and Topol noted that these victories had been “fueled by the $10 billion governmental investment in Operation Warp Speed."" “During the first year of the pandemic, meaningful evolution of the virus was slow-paced, without any functional consequences, but since that time we have seen a succession of important variants of concern, with increasing transmissibility and immune evasion, culminating in the Omicron lineages,” Iwasaki and Topol wrote. Recent developments have “spotlighted the possibility of nasal vaccines,” they wrote, saying that these types of vaccines could help boost “circulating immunity.” Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have for some time been looking to vet an array of next-generation vaccine concepts, including ones that trigger mucosal immunity, The Washington Post reported in April. At the Tuesday summit, several participants at the White House summit, including Jha, stressed the role of public-private partnerships were key to the fast development of the initial COVID vaccines. They said continued support from the U.S. government will be needed to make advances in this field. One of the presenters at the summit, Biao He, PhD, founder, and president of CyanVac and Blue Lake Biotechnology, spoke of the federal support that his efforts have received over the years to develop intranasal vaccines. His Athens, GA-based firm already has an experimental intranasal vaccine candidate, CVXGA1-001, in The CVXGA-001 builds on technology already used in a veterinary product, an intranasal vaccine long used to prevent kennel cough in dogs, he said at the summit. But the emerging field of experimental intranasal COVID vaccines already has had at least one setback. The biotech Altimmune Inc. in June 2021 announced that it would discontinue development of its experimental intranasal AdCOVID vaccine following disappointing Phase 1 results. The vaccine appeared to be well tolerated in the test, but the immunogenicity data showed lower than expected results in healthy volunteers, especially considering the responses seen to already cleared vaccines, Altimmune said in a release.",0
1051,"Scientists have discovered a new material that can be applied to diabetic wounds to heal them faster with just one application.

Researchers from the University of Nottingham have discovered a new class of polymer that can provide instructions to both immune and non-immune cells to aid healing in hard-to-treat diabetic wounds. The findings have been published in Advanced Materials.

Wound healing is a complex biological process that involves various cell types working together, with a cell type called fibroblasts playing a critical role in forming new tissue required for healing. Diabetes can disrupt these processes in cells making wound healing slow and difficult to treat. This can lead to infection and in extreme cases the need for amputation.

Experts from the School of Life Sciences and Pharmacy screened 315 different polymer surfaces, examining the different chemical make-up of each until they identified a polymer type that actively drives fibroblasts and immune cells to promote healing. A team from the School of Engineering made small particles that are decorated with this polymer on their surface. These particles could be directly applied to the wound area.

A polymer is a chemical compound made up of molecules bonded together in long, repeating chains. This structure gives polymers unique properties that can be tailored for different uses. Using polymer microparticles the team showed how this new material, when delivered to a wound on an animal model, produces three times more fibroblast activity over a period of up to 96 hours and achieved more than 80% wound closure.

This new polymer could be applied as a coating to standard wound dressings to provide a fast and effective treatment.

Professor Amir Ghaemmaghami from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham is one of the lead authors on the study and says: ""This research is a significant step towards being able to create a new, low cost, effective treatment for diabetic wounds. The results we saw were achieved in just one application, which could be transformative for patients whose current treatment often involves repeated treatments delivered by trained health professionals.""

Professor Morgan Alexander from the School of Pharmacy at the University of Nottingham added: ""We have shown the medical potential of novel polymers in previous work; our bacterial biofilm resistant materials are used on urinary catheters in the NHS, showing how this can prevent infection by changing the bacterial cell behaviour at the polymer surface. These polymers also have the potential to be easily applied to dressings, and we are already working with industry partners to develop ways to help wound healing in this way.""",0

1058,"Results in cell and mouse studies may have implications for the development of a new class of anticancer drugs.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston have uncovered a potential new approach against liver cancer that could lead to the development of a new class of anticancer drugs. In a series of experiments in cells and mice, researchers found that an enzyme produced in liver cancer cells could convert a group of compounds into anticancer drugs, killing cells and reducing disease in animals.

The researchers suggest that this enzyme could become a potential target for the development of new drugs against liver cancers, and perhaps other cancers and diseases as well.

“We found a molecule that kills cells in a rare liver cancer in a unique way,” said translational scientist Matthew Hall, Ph.D., one of the leaders of the work at NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). “It emerged from a screening to find molecules that selectively kill human liver cancer cells. It took a lot of work to figure out that the molecule is converted by an enzyme in these liver cancer cells, creating a toxic, anticancer drug.”

Hall, Nabeel Bardeesy, Ph.D., a liver cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and their colleagues reported their results March 13 in Nature Cancer.

The finding stems from a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital and NCATS researchers. Bardeesy was originally studying cholangiocarcinoma, a type of liver cancer that affects the bile duct. The cancer is characterized by mutations in the IDH1 enzyme. Bardeesy’s team wanted to find compounds and drugs that might be effective against the IDH1 mutation. Through a collaboration with NCATS, Hall and other NCATS scientists rapidly tested thousands of approved drugs and experimental cancer agents for their effectiveness in killing cholangiocarcinoma cells, with IDH1 as a target.

They found several molecules, including one called YC-1, could kill the cancer cells. Yet, when they looked to see how YC-1 was working, they discovered the compound wasn’t affecting the IDH1 mutation.

The Massachusetts researchers showed that the liver cancer cells made an enzyme, SULT1A1. The enzyme activated the YC-1 compound, making it toxic to tumor cells in cancer cell cultures and mouse models of liver cancers. In the animal models treated with YC-1, the liver tumors either had reduced growth or shrank. Conversely, the researchers found no changes in tumors treated with YC-1 in animals with cancer cells lacking the enzyme.

The researchers examined other databases of drug screening results in compound and drug libraries to match drug activity with SULT1A1 activity. They also looked at a large National Cancer Institute database of anticancer compounds for additional possibilities to test for their activity with the enzyme.

They identified several classes of compounds that relied on SULT1A1 for their tumor-killing activity. Using computational methods, they predicted other compounds that also likely were dependent on SULT1A1.

“Once we found SULT1A1 activated YC-1, it led us to ask, ‘What other compounds are active and can kill cells by the same mechanism?’ Hall said. “Can we identify other compounds that were being developed and demonstrate that they were also active because of SULT1A1 activation? The answer was yes. We found other compounds with the same mechanism of action as YC-1.”

The scientists suggest these findings have broader implications for developing new anticancer drugs. “We think these molecules have the potential to be an untapped class of anticancer drugs that depend on SULT1A1 for their activity against tumors,” Bardeesy said.

The researchers see YC-1 and similar molecules as prototypes for developing compounds that could be effective against important proteins on cells. Modifying different parts of these molecules could make them more specific for such proteins. The researchers point to the creation of a “toolkit of SULT1A1-activated molecules” that could affect many different targets.

Such a toolkit is comprised of hundreds of known molecules. In theory, the toolkit covers many types of enzymes, called sulfotransferases, that are active in different tissues in the body. For example, in addition to SULT1A1, the human sulfotransferase SULT4A1 is active in the brain. It can activate a subset of the molecules in the toolkit. This might be useful in developing drugs specific for brain cancers.

“We knew SULT1A1-dependent drugs had already been identified,” Bardeesy said. “Our results suggest there could be other SULT1A1-dependent compounds with ranges of different targets. Identifying such compounds and targets on cells could have potential implications for developing other types of small molecules and drugs, not just limited to these cancers. This might become a new approach for some diseases.”

1071,"Since the late 1800s non-nutritive sweeteners have promised to deliver all the sweetness of sugar with none of the calories. They have long been believed to have no effect on the human body, but researchers publishing in the journal Cell on August 19 challenge this notion by finding that these sugar substitutes are not inert, and, in fact, some can alter human consumers' microbiomes in a way that can change their blood sugar levels.

In 2014, senior author Eran Elinav an immunologist and microbiome researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science and the German National Cancer Center (DKFZ) and his team found that non-nutritive sweeteners affected the microbiomes of mice in ways that could impact their glycemic responses. The team was interested in whether these results would also be found in humans.

To address this important question, the research team carefully screened over 1300 individuals for those who strictly avoid non-nutritive sweeteners in their day-to-day lives, and identified a cohort of 120 individuals. These participants were broken into six groups: two controls and four who ingested well below the FDA daily allowances of either aspartame, saccharin, stevia, or sucralose.

""In subjects consuming the non-nutritive sweeteners, we could identify very distinct changes in the composition and function of gut microbes, and the molecules they secret into peripheral blood. This seemed to suggest that gut microbes in the human body are rather responsive to each of these sweeteners,"" says Elinav. ""When we looked at consumers of non-nutritive sweeteners as groups, we found that two of the non-nutritive sweeteners, saccharin and sucralose, significantly impacted glucose tolerance in healthy adults. Interestingly, changes in the microbes were highly correlated with the alterations noted in people's glycemic responses.""

To establish causation, the researchers transferred microbial samples from the study subjects to germ-free mice -- mice that have been raised in completely sterile conditions and have no microbiome of their own.

""The results were quite striking,"" says Elinav. ""In all of the non-nutritive sweetener groups, but in none of the controls, when we transferred into these sterile mice the microbiome of the top responder individuals collected at a time point in which they were consuming the respective non-nutritive sweeteners, the recipient mice developed glycemic alterations that very significantly mirrored those of the donor individuals. In contrast, the bottom responders' microbiomes were mostly unable to elicit such glycemic responses,"" he adds. ""These results suggest that the microbiome changes in response to human consumption of non-nutritive sweetener may, at times, induce glycemic changes in consumers in a highly personalized manner.""

Elinav says that he expects the effects of the sweeteners will vary person to person because of the incredibly unique composition of our microbiome. ""We need to raise awareness of the fact that non-nutritive sweeteners are not inert to the human body as we originally believed. With that said, the clinical health implications of the changes they may elicit in humans remain unknown and merit future long-term studies.""

""In the meantime, we need to continue searching for solutions to our sweet tooth craving, while avoiding sugar, which is clearly most harmful to our metabolic health,"" says Elinav. ""In my personal view, drinking only water seems to be the best solution.""",0

1074,"A common, economic, and easy method of administering drugs is orally, by swallowing a pill or capsule. But oral administration is the most complex way for the human body to absorb an active pharmaceutical ingredient, because the bioavailability of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract depends on the medication's ingredients and the stomach's dynamic physiological environment.

In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine employ a biomimetic in-silico simulator based on the realistic anatomy and morphology of the stomach -- a ""StomachSim"" -- to investigate and quantify the effect of body posture and stomach motility on drug bioavailability.

""Oral administration is surprisingly complex despite being the most common choice for drug administration,"" said co-author Rajat Mittal. ""When the pill reaches the stomach, the motion of the stomach walls and the flow of contents inside determine the rate at which it dissolves. The properties of the pill and the stomach contents also play a major role.

""However, current experimental or clinical procedures for assessing the dissolution of oral drugs are limited in their ability to study this, which makes it a challenge to understand how the dissolution is affected in different stomach disorders, such as gastroparesis, which slows down the emptying of the stomach.""

Stomach contents, motility, and gastric fluid dynamics all play a role in a drug's bioavailability, and stomach contractions can induce pressure and generate complex pill trajectories. This results in varying rates of pill dissolution and nonuniform emptying of the drug into the duodenum and, sometimes, gastric dumping in the case of modified-release dosage.

Together, these issues pose several challenges for the design of drug delivery.

""In this work, we demonstrate a novel computer simulation platform that offers the potential for overcoming these limitations,"" said Mittal. ""Our models can generate biorelevant data on drug dissolution that can provide useful and unique insights into the complex physiological processes behind the oral administration of pills.""

The modeling appears to be the first of its kind to couple gastric biomechanics with pill movement and drug dissolution to quantify an active pharmaceutical ingredient passing through the pylorus into the duodenum. The model enabled the researchers to calculate and compare the emptying rate and the release of a dissolved active pharmaceutical ingredient into the duodenum for a variety of physiological situations.",0

1086,"ROCHESTER, Minn. -- Much remains unknown about COVID-19, but many studies already have indicated that people with cardiovascular disease are at greater risk of being susceptible to COVID-19. There also have been reports of ST-segment elevation (STE), a signal of obstructive coronary artery disease, in patients with COVID-19 who after invasive coronary angiography show no sign of the disease.

This false signal of coronary artery disease may cause patients to undergo procedures that present unnecessary risks, especially in the COVID-19 environment, according to a special article published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The article, written by a team of Mayo Clinic cardiovascular experts and radiologists, proposes algorithms for evaluating patients and determining a course of treatment.

""The impact of false activation of the catheterization laboratory includes inherent risks, beginning with the invasive arterial procedure itself and related care for these patients,"" says J. Wells Askew, M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist. In cases where patients test positive for COVID-19, the risks include respiratory failure, and potential exposure of medical staff and the downstream effects on cardiac catheterization laboratories and cardiac imaging services.

""Nonetheless, it's critically important for patients who are experiencing a heart attack due to coronary occlusion to receive immediate and appropriate treatment,"" says Dr. Askew. ""There is an urgent need for an algorithm that guides triage of patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 with STE to determine initial invasive or noninvasive pathways.""

The article notes that acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia and shock are common in patients with acute respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Myocardial injury is defined by an elevated cardiac troponin level; when myocardial injury is acute and occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia, it can signal a heart attack.

The article proposes algorithms, based on expert consensus, for responding to patients with STE and acute myocardial injury. It also provides guidance on decision-making regarding the use of an echocardiogram or a coronary CT angiogram for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

""The reported experiences from countries in which significant exposure to COVID-19 has occurred highlight the challenges we have in treating patients with COVID-19 and STE on the electrocardiogram,"" says Dr. Askew. ""Health care facilities need to rapidly prepare for this, so they can appropriately triage these patients with invasive or noninvasive pathways. This is critically important to minimize risks for the patient as well as risk of COVID-19 exposure to medical personnel.""

1088,"NIH clinical trial to test antibodies and other experimental therapeutics for mild and moderate COVID-19

Initial trial to determine if monoclonal antibodies can shorten severity of COVID-19 in outpatients.

A Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics for COVID-19, including an investigational therapeutic based on synthetic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to treat the disease. Researchers sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, are working with clinical sites to identify potential patient volunteers currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, who have mild to moderate disease not requiring hospitalization. They will be invited to take an experimental therapy or a placebo as part of a rigorously designed randomized clinical trial. The trial, which is known as ACTIV-2, also may investigate other experimental therapeutics later under the same trial protocol.

If the investigational mAbs show promise, the study would expand from a Phase 2 to a Phase 3 trial to gather additional critical data from a larger pool of volunteers without delay. The trial will be led by the NIAID-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and will enroll participants at sites around the world.

ACTIV-2 was established as part of NIH’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV), a public-private partnership program instituted to speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccines. This study is also receiving support through Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s multi-agency effort to develop, manufacture and distribute medical countermeasures to fight COVID-19.

The design of the study is adaptive to enable maximum flexibility in the shortest time frame. If the experimental treatment appears effective in the first stage, the treatment can be advanced rapidly to testing in larger groups of volunteers. The study also can be adapted to test additional therapeutics.

“We have seen encouraging, rapid results from other adaptive treatment trials for COVID-19,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “Under ACTIV, specific therapeutics are being prioritized based on their likelihood for success. Prioritized therapeutics under ACTIV will use a master protocol that emphasizes flexibility, which enables these critical trials to be conducted without incurring delays when a treatment shows promise.”

The first therapeutic to be tested in this trial will be LY-CoV555, an investigational monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Indiana). LY-CoV555 emerged from Lilly’s collaboration with AbCellera Biologics (Vancouver, British Columbia). Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins produced by immune cells. So-called neutralizing antibodies target specific viruses or other pathogens. This antibody, which was discovered by AbCellera in collaboration with NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center, was isolated from a blood sample from a recovered COVID-19 patient. Copies of this antibody were then synthesized in a lab—the term “monoclonal” refers to these laboratory-manufactured antibodies.

“Using an antibody generated by the immune system of a recovered COVID-19 patient gives us a jump start on finding a safe and effective therapeutic,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “Investigating a variety of different therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies, will help ensure that we advance towards an effective treatment for people suffering from COVID-19 disease as quickly as possible.”

The initial stage of the trial is designed to enroll approximately 220 volunteers who report recently experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and who test positive for the virus but are not hospitalized. Once enrolled, they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 110 volunteers will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of LY-CoV555, and 110 volunteers will receive a placebo infusion of a saline solution. The infusion takes approximately an hour to deliver, and volunteers will be observed afterwards to note any reactions.

Over the next 28 days, participants will attend a series of clinic or at-home visits by clinicians to track their COVID-19 symptoms. Investigators also will check whether RNA from SARS-CoV-2, can still be detected in participants’ noses and saliva using a standard nasopharyngeal swab. Because people with COVID-19 often have unusually low blood oxygen levels, participants will receive pulse oximetry tests to help determine if the investigational therapeutic has a positive effect on blood oxygen levels. They also will give blood samples to help researchers understand how the experimental therapeutics are functioning in their bodies, as well as whether they are affecting the course of their SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants will receive additional follow-up for up to 24 weeks.

The primary goals of the Phase 2 trial are to evaluate safety, to see if the investigational therapeutic can reduce the duration of symptoms through study day 28, and to see if the investigational therapeutic can increase the proportion of participants with undetectable virus in nasopharyngeal swabs at specific time points. If there are no serious safety concerns and if the investigational therapeutic appears to meet other specific other criteria (such as sufficiently reducing the duration of symptoms or the viral load in the volunteers’ bodies), the trial will transition to Phase 3 and enroll up to 1,780 additional outpatient volunteers, for a total of 2,000 trial participants. The primary goal of the Phase 3 study will be to determine if the investigational therapeutic can prevent either hospitalization or death through study day 28 while also continuing to evaluate its safety. Participants in the Phase 3 portion of the study will not be provided nasopharyngeal swabs, though they will still perform self-collected anterior nasal swabs, and they will attend fewer clinic visits.

The study team is led by Protocol Chair Davey Smith, M.D., of the University of California, San Diego, David Wohl, M.D., of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and Kara W. Chew, M.D., and Eric S. Daar, M.D., both of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA),serve as protocol vice-chairs. The ACTG network is led by chair Judith Currier, M.D. (UCLA) and co-chair Joseph Eron, M.D. (UNC).

To ensure that the trial is being conducted in a safe and effective manner, an independent data and safety monitoring board will oversee the trial and periodically review the accumulating data.

1090,"Senior citizens who are not vitamin D deficient have a better chance of walking after hip fracture surgery, according to a Rutgers-led study.

The findings in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggest that vitamin D deficiency could limit mobility in older adults, said senior author Sue Shapses, a professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.

Shapses suggests that older adults take 800 international units (IU), equivalent to 20 micrograms, of vitamin D daily to prevent deficiency. Vitamin D is important for bone health, and people get it through some foods, exposure to the sun and vitamin pills.

""An important next step is learning how vitamin D affects mobility,"" said Shapses, who is also an adjunct professor in the Department of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and director of the Center for Human Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism at Rutgers' New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition, and Health. ""For example, it is not clear if severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with direct effects on muscle, cognition and/or other organ systems.""

A broken hip -- among the most serious fall injuries -- is hard to recover from, with many people unable to live on their own afterward. In the United States, more than 300,000 people 65 or older are hospitalized for hip fractures annually and falling causes more than 95 percent of these type of fractures. Women fall more frequently than men, experiencing three-quarters of hip fractures, and the number of fractures is likely to rise as the population ages, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Regaining mobility after a hip fracture is important for full recovery and to reduce the risk of death. But vitamin D deficiency is associated with reduced mobility after surgery to repair a hip fracture.

The multi-site study of patients 65 or older in the United States and Canada examined the influence of vitamin D levels in blood serum and nutrition on mobility. The study focused on death rate or inability to walk 10 feet (or across a room) without someone's help after surgery.

The findings showed that vitamin D levels greater than 12 nanograms per milliliter (12 parts per billion) in blood serum are associated with a higher rate of walking at 30 and 60 days after hip fracture surgery. While poor nutrition is associated with reduced mobility 30 days after surgery, that factor was not statistically significant. Still, in patients with high levels of parathyroid hormone, which leads to high levels of calcium in blood, mobility was reduced if their nutritional status was poor.

""This matters because vitamin D deficiency and malnutrition are common disorders in elderly patients with hip fractures and often occur together since both are complications of poor nutrition,"" Shapses said.

Previous studies have shown that taking 800 IU of vitamin D a day can prevent falling and fractures. A Rutgers-led study published last year indicated that high vitamin D intake (4,000 IU a day) compared with 600 IU a day may reduce reaction time, potentially boosting the risk of falling and fractures. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D is 600 IU daily for people from 1 to 70 years old and 800 for people over 70.

""These studies suggest that too much or too little vitamin D will affect mobility and falls in the elderly,"" Shapses said.

1091,"One of the first real-world data studies comparing the new bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccines with the original monovalent vaccines reports the bivalent conveyed greater short-term protection against symptomatic COVID-19 infection in adults.

The multi-state study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's VISION Network found that the bivalent booster dose provides greater short-term protection against symptomatic COVID-19 infections which generate emergency department and urgent care visits or hospitalization, compared to prior receipt of two, three or even four doses of first-generation vaccines without a bivalent booster vaccine.

How well the bivalent shots protect against COVID-19-associated medical visits had previously been largely unknown.

""This study clearly shows the benefit conveyed by a bivalent booster vaccine -- lowering the risk that you will have to go to the E.D. or be hospitalized due to COVID,"" said study co-author Shaun Grannis, M.D., M.S., vice president for data and analytics at Regenstrief Institute and Regenstrief Professor of Medical Informatics at Indiana University School of Medicine.

The study found that from mid-September to mid-November 2022, adults who had received bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines made 57 percent fewer COVID-19 related emergency department or urgent care visits compared to adults without prior vaccination and 51 percent fewer visits compared to adults who first had received monovalent vaccines. Bivalent booster vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was also significant -- 61 percent compared to adults without prior vaccination and 44 percent compared to adults who were vaccinated with first generation vaccines.

Among adults who had completed a primary vaccine series or one or more monovalent boosters, greater time since the most recent dose was associated with greater relative protection following the bivalent booster vaccine.

Data from immunocompromised individuals were not included in this study of the effectiveness of bivalent mRNA vaccines.

The authors conclude, ""These findings support efforts to improve coverage with bivalent vaccines, although optimal timing for receipt of bivalent vaccine booster doses needs to be established. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including receiving a bivalent booster dose. In addition, persons should consider taking other precautions to avoid respiratory illness this winter season, including masking in public indoor spaces, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high, to protect themselves and others and reduce strain on the health care system during an ongoing surge in multiple respiratory viruses.""",0

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. The study appears in Scientific Reports.

Gestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother’s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.

In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.

The researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).

Women who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.

In middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.

“Our results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,” said the study’s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Exercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.

The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.

1093,"June 7, 2022 – The U.S. threw out 82.1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses between December 2020 and mid-May 2022, tossing about 11% of the doses distributed.

Pharmacies, states, territories, and federal agencies got rid of doses that expired on shelves before they could be used, that spoiled when the power went out or freezers broke, and that were tossed at the end of the day when no one used the remaining doses in an opened vial, according to NBC News.

The overall number of discarded doses falls in line with public health estimates for large vaccination campaigns using multidose vials, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine wastage rates calculator. But public health experts have said the waste is still alarming when 53% of fully vaccinated Americans haven’t gotten a booster shot.

“It’s a tremendous loss to pandemic control, especially in the context of millions of people around the world who haven’t even been able to get a first dose,” Sheela Shenoi, MD, medical director of the infectious diseases program at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News.",0

1096,"Despite some improvements to lower “bad” cholesterol levels, people with cardiovascular diseases still need to do a better job controlling overall blood lipid levels, according to a UC Irvine Heart Disease Prevention Program study.

Researchers found that 37 percent of Americans with diseases that affect the heart and vascular system had reached recommended levels of LDL-C (bad cholesterol), but only 17 percent were at recommended levels for all lipids – LDL-C, HDL-C (“good” cholesterol) and triglycerides. In contrast, 85 percent of those without cardiovascular diseases were at recommended LDL-C levels, while 67 percent were at recommended levels for all lipids.

The study reveals that many adults, particularly those with known cardiovascular diseases, inadequately control these key lipids. Proper diet, exercise, and more appropriate use of therapies to target all lipids are needed, especially for those most at risk, said Nathan D. Wong, study leader and Heart Disease Prevention Program director.

The researchers analyzed data from the nearly 3,000 adults older than 20 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2003-04 and published their findings in the American Heart Journal.

“While national treatment recommendations have focused on aggressive management of LDL-C levels, mainly through statin therapy, we have found little change in HDL-C levels and an actual increase in triglyceride levels,” Wong said. “This is not good news, as these factors are important components of cardiovascular risk.”

Persons with known cardiovascular diseases should have LDL-C levels below 100 mg (or below 130 mg for most other adults). For all adults, HDL-C levels should be 40 mg or higher for men and 50 mg or higher for women. Triglyceride levels should be below 150 mg.

Obesity and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle are controllable factors that can lead to low HDL-C and elevated LDL-C and triglycerides. High blood pressure, smoking and diabetes can further compound risks associated with high lipid levels.

Wong recommends that all adults have a lipid profile done and speak to their healthcare provider about lifestyle measures and appropriate medications to improve their levels.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading killer of Americans, taking nearly 500,000 lives each year. To decrease risk, doctors recommend that people control their weight, blood pressure and blood lipid levels through good lifestyle habits and minimal stress.

1097,"A University at Buffalo researcher has some good news for athletes and fitness enthusiasts who favor thick, heavily cushioned running shoes. Although these shoes are increasingly popular because they provide comfort and a high degree of shock absorbing protection, those benefits were thought to come at the expense of increased overall leg stiffness, which altered a runner's normal stride and could increase muscle fatigue.

Plenty of research suggests just such a result when running on a compliant surface, like a synthetic rubber track, but no one had actually tested how the cushioned midsole of a running shoe affects overall leg stiffness.

""Our results show that runners do not need to worry about the amount of cushioning,"" says Nicholas Holowka, PhD, an assistant professor of anthropology in the UB College of Arts and Sciences and the paper's first author. ""That element of shoe design is not interrupting your normal running style in any significant or meaningful way.""

The findings of the study conducted with Daniel Lieberman, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University; Emmanuel Virot, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard; and Stephen Gillinov, a medical school student at Yale University, appear in the Journal of Biomechanics.

Leg stiffness can be compared to a spring's tension. If the leg alone were modeled as a single spring, that coil would have one level of stiffness. The leg, however, is made up of many muscles that control degrees of stiffness. When running on cushioned surfaces, leg stiffness increases, but that's not the case when running in heavily cushioned shoes.

""There is an assumed optimal leg stiffness for runners, but if you increase your leg stiffness above that point you'd be using more muscles to stiffen that leg spring, which means more energy and fatigue over long distance,"" says Holowka, an expert on the biomechanics of walking and running. ""We were interested in the idea that when people run on surfaces that are elastic, with a certain amount of compliance, they subconsciously change the stiffness of their leg to maintain an optimal stiffness. Was this the same when it came to the cushioning of their shoes?""

At a glance, the absence of research on midsole running shoe thickness and running style seems surprising, but Holowka says the problem is more complicated than it appears.

""It's very hard to account for all of the factors in such a way that allows you to isolate specifically on the stiffness of the footwear itself,"" he says. ""If you try to compare different shoes, then you have design differences, like heel height or arch support, which makes it difficult if not impossible to look at the effects of the shoe's cushioning.

""Our study was geared at looking at this one variable.""

And to do that, Holowka's team custom created sandals for the study.

The researchers enrolled 20 experienced runners and measured them in four different conditions: barefoot and sandals made from three different materials. The first sandals were a commercially available model inspired by the footwear of the Tarahumara, an Indigenous population living in Mexico who have developed a tradition of long-distance running. These sandals, made from the common shoe cushioning material ethylene-vinyl acetate foam (EVA), served as molds for two other similar designs with different degrees of cushioning.

Participants ran on treadmills that measured the forces the body was putting against the ground. Their motions were also measured through a specialized camera system. The data contributed to a model of the leg as a linear spring, which allowed the researchers to calculate leg stiffness under the different conditions

""We went into this with the hypothesis that the cushioning might change leg stiffness, but that just wasn't supported,"" says Holowka. ""The results show that your running style is still natural even when running in these heavily cushioned shoes.

""Our findings tell us something that was previously unknown about shoe design, essentially the extent to which shoe cushioning influences normal running style.""

And that's important information for runners who prefer heavily cushioned shoes, but are concerned about how those shoes affect running style, according to Holowka.

""You can have that cushioning if you like it and still run with normal natural leg stiffness,"" he says.",0

1103,"High triglycerides -- a type of fat, or lipid, in the blood -- increase the risk of heart disease and perhaps type 2 diabetes. For the first time, it has been shown that profoundly lowering triglycerides in diabetics improves their insulin sensitivity over time, which helps them maintain healthy glucose -- blood sugar -- levels. Volanesorsen, an experimental lipid-lowering medication, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control by significantly decreasing patients' overall hemoglobin A1c -- the standard clinical measurement of blood glucose levels for diabetics -- in a new study reported by researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The results are published online this month in Diabetes Care.

Researchers enrolled 15 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia who had been taking metformin -- an oral medication that helps control blood sugar levels -- for their diabetes. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one to receive volanesorsen and the other a placebo. After taking the medication for 12 weeks, researchers found that patients on volanesorsen experienced a 69 percent reduction in triglycerides, and a 57 percent improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity. Several tests of glucose control, including hemoglobin A1c, were also significantly improved. Researchers concluded that the drop in triglycerides was strongly related to improved insulin sensitivity and improved hemoglobin A1c.

""These results prove volanesorsen to be an effective treatment method for improving insulin sensitivity, but what's most interesting, and perhaps most encouraging, is that this drug also significantly improved patients' hemoglobin A1c levels,"" said the study's lead co-author, Richard Dunbar, MD, an assistant professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Penn. ""In most cases, it takes many months of therapy to improve the hemoglobin A1c, so to move the needle so significantly in a fairly short time is very promising. Scientifically, these results provide important proof that profoundly lowering triglycerides improves insulin sensitivity. And clinically, the results go a step further and show that doing so improves the underlying metabolic problems enough to actually improve diabetes.""

To quantify the effects of the drug, researchers used a very sophisticated test of insulin sensitivity, the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp or ""the clamp,"" which is largely regarded as the gold standard in insulin sensitivity measurement. This technique infuses insulin at fixed rates, and infuses glucose at a varying rate to keep blood glucose constant, in order to determine how well a patient responds to insulin.

For many years, researchers had suspected that high triglycerides worsened diabetes, but there had not been powerful tool to prove this concept.

""While we were able to determine the effectiveness of this medication in a very specific group of diabetic patients, it will be important to evaluate this drug in a broader diabetic population,"" Dunbar said. ""The next phase will be to determine clinical success in patients with type 2 diabetes on the whole range of diabetic medications or perhaps with less severe lipid problems. It will also be important to conduct longer studies, as glucose control may improve even further with longer exposures to the drug.""

Several other classes of medications that profoundly lower triglycerides are also in development. If improved insulin sensitivity and improved glucose control are truly the result of lowering triglycerides, researchers suggest these other novel drugs should show the same effect.

Dunbar added, ""after a long dry spell, there is a lot of activity right now for triglyceride-lowering therapies. Penn Medicine has been conducting several clinical trials evaluating this and other novel triglyceride-lowering drugs. Not only do we have a variety of very potent options emerging, we may be able to help improve glucose at the same time. Both of these developments would be great news for our patients with high triglycerides, including diabetics.""",0

The idea of persistent mRNA or spike protein after COVID vaccination gets recycled regularly by conspiracy theorists. I am not aware of any new data in that space. We know that any naked RNA in cells and in circulation is chopped up quickly [in the body] - so vaccine mRNA persistence defies what we know about biology. And if people are worried about spike protein flying around, they should be much more concerned with COVID-19 disease vs vaccination. We know people have high burden of spike protein associated with replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus (in other words, being infected and having COVID-19 disease).

1106,"Six-year vitamin E supplementation increased tuberculosis risk by 72% in male smokers who had high dietary vitamin C intake, but vitamin E had no effect on those who had low dietary vitamin C intake, according to a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition.

Previous studies had suggested that vitamin E might improve the immune system. In animal studies vitamin E seemed to protect against various infections.

Harri Hemila and Jaakko Kaprio, of the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, studied whether vitamin E supplementation might decrease the risk of tuberculosis. They analyzed the data of the randomized trial (Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study) which was conducted in Finland between 1985-1993 and included male smokers aged 50-69 years. There were 174 cases of tuberculosis in 29,023 participants during the 6-year supplementation of 50 mg/day vitamin E.

The effect of vitamin E on tuberculosis risk was modified by the intake of vitamin C in diet. Vitamin E had no effect on participants who had dietary vitamin C intake less than 90 mg/day. Unexpectedly, vitamin E supplementation increased tuberculosis risk by 72% in those who had dietary vitamin C intake over 90 mg/day. The most dramatic increase in tuberculosis risk by vitamin E was restricted to a one-year period after the initiation of supplementation.

The US nutritional recommendations, issued by the prestigious Institute of Medicine, consider that vitamin E is safe in amounts up to 1000 mg/day. This new study suggests that in some population groups vitamin E supplementation may be harmful at a substantially lower dose, 50 mg/day.

The researchers concluded that ""the consumption of vitamin E supplements by the general population should be discouraged because there is evidence of harm for some people.""",0
1107,"MONDAY, March 27, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- For depressed or anxious children, taking melatonin may afford a good night's sleep and, as a result, lower the odds they will harm themselves, new research suggests. The risk of self-harm increased before melatonin was prescribed and decreased by about half after kids started taking the supplement, the study found. Teen girls suffering from depression or anxiety were the most likely to benefit. ""This suggests that melatonin might be responsible for the reduced self-harm rates, but we cannot rule out that the use of other psychiatric medications or psychotherapy may have influenced the findings,"" said senior researcher Sarah Bergen, from the department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. ""Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone, and we believe the findings are due to improved sleep,"" she said. The study can't prove that melatonin caused the drop off in self-harm, only that there appears to be a link.

Of the more than 25,000 young people in the study, 87% had psychiatric disorders in addition to sleep problems. ""Melatonin was probably only one part of their treatment package,"" Bergen said. ""We found that controlling for antidepressant use did not appreciably alter the results, but it’s possible that other medications or psychotherapy are contributing to the observed findings."" For the study, her team identified nearly 25,600 Swedish youngsters between 6 and 18 years of age who were prescribed melatonin. Most had at least one psychiatric disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, depression or autism spectrum disorder were the most common. Girls were about five times more likely to harm themselves than boys, the study authors noted. Self-harm can include cutting or burning oneself, breaking bones, and other behaviors that can cause injury or lead to suicide attempts. ""Melatonin has no serious side effects and is not addictive, so using it to improve sleep in children and adolescents could be an important intervention strategy leading to reduced self-harm behaviors in this population,"" Bergen said. An expert who reviewed the findings agreed that the reduction in self-harm seen in the study is a result of better sleep.",0

National Institutes of Health scientists have developed an ultrasensitive new test to detect abnormal forms of the protein tau associated with uncommon types of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. As they describe in Acta Neuropathologica, this advance gives them hope of using cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF—an accessible patient sample—to diagnose these and perhaps other, more common neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

Scientists have linked the abnormal deposition of tau in the brain to at least 25 different neurodegenerative diseases. However, to accurately diagnose these diseases, brain tissue often must be analyzed after the patient has died.

For their study, the researchers used the same test concept they developed when using post-mortem brain tissue samples to detect the abnormal tau types associated with Pick disease, Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). They adapted the test to use CSF for the detection of abnormal tau of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and other less common tauopathies.

They detected abnormal tau in CSF from both living and deceased patients. In one case, the test led to a corrected diagnosis in a patient who had died from CBD, but who was initially diagnosed with PSP. The new test is called 4R RT-QuIC—which stands for 4-repeat tau protein amplified in a real-time, quaking-induced conversion process.

The test was developed at NIH’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories, part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Study collaborators, who provided patient specimens and clinical guidance, included investigators from the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida; the University of Bologna, Italy; the University of California, San Diego; the University of California, San Francisco; Indiana University; and the University of Verona in Italy.

The researchers plan to continue evaluating the clinical performance of 4R RT-QuIC by analyzing larger sets of CSF samples. One focus will be to compare test results from tauopathy patients who agree to provide CSF samples both before and after death. The scientists hope this type of evaluation will help them better understand how abnormal tau in CSF evolves during brain disease.

1113,"Eating higher levels of fish, including tuna and non-fried fish, appears to be associated with a greater risk of malignant melanoma, suggests a large study of US adults published in Cancer Causes & Control.

Eunyoung Cho, the corresponding author said: ""Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the USA and the risk of developing melanoma over a lifetime is one in 38 for white people, one in 1,000 for Black people and one in 167 for Hispanic people1. Although fish intake has increased in the USA and Europe in recent decades, the results of previous studies investigating associations between fish intake and melanoma risk have been inconsistent. Our findings have identified an association that requires further investigation.""

Researchers from Brown University, USA found that, compared to those whose median daily fish intake was 3.2 grams, the risk of malignant melanoma was 22% higher among those whose median daily intake was 42.8 grams. They also found that those whose median daily intake was 42.8 grams of fish had a 28% increased risk of developing abnormal cells in the outer layer of the skin only -- known as stage 0 melanoma or melanoma in situ -- compared to those whose median daily intake was 3.2 grams of fish. A portion of fish is approximately 140 grams of cooked fish.

To examine the relationship between fish intake and melanoma risk, the authors analysed data collected from 491,367 adults who were recruited from across the USA to the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study between 1995 and 1996. Participants, who were aged 62 years on average, reported how frequently they ate fried fish, non-fried fish, and tuna during the previous year as well as their portion sizes.

The researchers calculated the incidence of new melanomas that developed over a median period of 15 years using data obtained from cancer registries. They accounted for sociodemographic factors, as well as participants' BMI, physical activity levels, smoking history, daily intake of alcohol, caffeine and calories, family history of cancer, and the average UV radiation levels in their local area. 5,034 participants (1.0%) developed malignant melanoma during the study period and 3,284 (0.7%) developed stage 0 melanoma.

The researchers found that higher intake of non-fried fish and tuna was associated with increased risks of malignant melanoma and stage 0 melanoma. Those whose median daily tuna intake was 14.2 grams had a 20% higher risk of malignant melanoma and a 17% higher risk of stage 0 melanoma, compared to those whose median daily tuna intake was 0.3 grams. A median intake of 17.8 grams of non-fried fish per day was associated with an 18% higher risk of malignant melanoma and a 25% higher risk of stage 0 melanoma, compared to a median intake of 0.3 grams of non-fried fish per day. The researchers did not identify significant associations between consumption of fried fish and the risk of malignant melanoma or stage 0 melanoma.

Eunyoung Cho said: ""We speculate that our findings could possibly be attributed to contaminants in fish, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, arsenic and mercury. Previous research has found that higher fish intake is associated with higher levels of these contaminants within the body and has identified associations between these contaminants and a higher risk of skin cancer. However, we note that our study did not investigate the concentrations of these contaminants in participants' bodies and so further research is needed to confirm this relationship.""

The researchers caution that the observational nature of their study does not allow for conclusions about a causal relationship between fish intake and melanoma risk. They also did not account for some risk factors for melanoma, such as mole count, hair colour, history of severe sunburn and sun-related behaviours in their analyses. Additionally, as average daily fish intake was calculated at the beginning of the study, it may not be representative of participants' lifetime diets.

The authors suggest that future research is needed to investigate the components of fish that could contribute to the observed association between fish intake and melanoma risk and any biological mechanisms underlying this. At present, they do not recommend any changes to fish consumption.",0
1114,"NIH scientists show how tularemia bacteria trick cells to cause disease

Francisella tularensis is the bacterium that causes tularemia, a life-threatening disease spread to humans via contact with an infected animal or through mosquito, tick or deer fly bites. As few as 10 viable bacteria can cause the disease, which has a death rate of up to 60 percent. Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — part of the National Institutes of Health — have unraveled the process by which the bacteria cause disease. They found that F. tularensis tricks host cell mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell, in two different phases of infection. In the first eight hours of infection, the bacteria increase mitochondria function, which inhibits cell death and prevents the cell from mounting an inflammatory response to avoid an immune system attack. In the 24 hours after, the bacteria impair mitochondrial function, undergo explosive replication and spread. These basic science findings could play a role in developing effective treatment strategies, according to the researchers.

Previously, researchers discovered that F. tularensis could inhibit inflammation following infection of immune system cells called macrophages, but they did not understand how it occurred. The new study, published in Infection and Immunity, illuminates that process, confirming that the bacterium’s manipulation of the mitochondrial machinery in the host cell is required to block strong inflammatory responses. Also, the researchers show that the timing of the manipulation of the mitochondria machinery during infection is important to how the bacteria control host cell death. The researchers also said this could be the first study to show that a bacterium’s sugar-like protective outer capsule, or polysaccharide, can increase mitochondria function, in this case, during early infection.

The researchers believe that better antimicrobial treatment strategies — against F. tularensis and possibly other pathogens — could result from further study of the role the capsule polysaccharide plays in manipulating mitochondria. For example, learning how to block the increased mitochondrial function in phase one could limit infection, they say. In their study, they also treated F. tularensis-infected macrophages in the laboratory with two types of drugs that protect mitochondria. The treatment reduced cell death and limited bacterial replication. The group plans to extend that work to mice.

1117,"Researchers restore sight in mice by turning skin cells into light-sensing eye cells

Researchers have discovered a technique for directly reprogramming skin cells into light-sensing rod photoreceptors used for vision. The lab-made rods enabled blind mice to detect light after the cells were transplanted into the animals’ eyes. The work, funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI), published April 15 in Nature. The NEI is part of the National Institutes of Health.

Up until now, researchers have replaced dying photoreceptors in animal models by creating stem cells from skin or blood cells, programming those stem cells to become photoreceptors, which are then transplanted into the back of the eye. In the new study, scientists show that it is possible to skip the stem-cell intermediary step and directly reprogram skins cells into photoreceptors for transplantation into the retina.

“This is the first study to show that direct, chemical reprogramming can produce retinal-like cells, which gives us a new and faster strategy for developing therapies for age-related macular degeneration and other retinal disorders caused by the loss of photoreceptors,” said Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., senior investigator in the NEI Neurobiology, Neurodegeneration, and Repair Laboratory, which characterized the reprogrammed rod photoreceptor cells by gene expression analysis.

“Of immediate benefit will be the ability to quickly develop disease models so we can study mechanisms of disease. The new strategy will also help us design better cell replacement approaches,” he said.

Scientists have studied induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with intense interest over the past decade. IPSCs are developed in a lab from adult cells —rather than fetal tissue— and can be used to make nearly any type of replacement cell or tissue. But iPS cell reprogramming protocols can take six months before cells or tissues are ready for transplantation. By contrast, the direct reprogramming described in the current study coaxed skin cells into functional photoreceptors ready for transplantation in only 10 days. The researchers demonstrated their technique in mouse eyes, using both mouse- and human-derived skin cells.

“Our technique goes directly from skin cell to photoreceptor without the need for stem cells in between,” said the study’s lead investigator, Sai Chavala, M.D., CEO and president of CIRC Therapeutics and the Center for Retina Innovation. Chavala is also director of retina services at KE Eye Centers of Texas and a professor of surgery at Texas Christian University and University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) School of Medicine, Fort Worth.

Direct reprogramming involves bathing the skin cells in a cocktail of five small molecule compounds that together chemically mediate the molecular pathways relevant for rod photoreceptor cell fate. The result are rod photoreceptors that mimic native rods in appearance and function.

The researchers performed gene expression profiling, which showed that the genes expressed by the new cells were similar to those expressed by real rod photoreceptors. At the same time, genes relevant to skin cell function had been downregulated.

The researchers transplanted the cells into mice with retinal degeneration and then tested their pupillary reflexes, which is a measure of photoreceptor function after transplantation. Under low-light conditions, constriction of the pupil is dependent on rod photoreceptor function. Within a month of transplantation, six of 14 (43%) animals showed robust pupil constriction under low light compared to none of the untreated controls.

Moreover, treated mice with pupil constriction were significantly more likely to seek out and spend time in dark spaces compared with treated mice with no pupil response and untreated controls. Preference for dark spaces is a behavior that requires vision and reflects the mouse’s natural tendency to seek out safe, dark locations as opposed to light ones.

“Even mice with severely advanced retinal degeneration, with little chance of having living photoreceptors remaining, responded to transplantation. Such findings suggest that the observed improvements were due to the lab-made photoreceptors rather than to an ancillary effect that supported the health of the host’s existing photoreceptors,” said the study’s first author Biraj Mahato, Ph.D., research scientist, UNTHSC.

Three months after transplantation, immunofluorescence studies confirmed the survival of the lab-made photoreceptors, as well as their synaptic connections to neurons in the inner retina.

Further research is needed to optimize the protocol to increase the number of functional transplanted photoreceptors.

“Importantly, the researchers worked out how this direct reprogramming is mediated at the cellular level. These insights will help researchers apply the technique not only to the retina, but to many other cell types,” Swaroop said.

“If efficiency of this direct conversion can be improved, this may significantly reduce the time it takes to develop a potential cell therapy product or disease model,” said Kapil Bharti, Ph.D., senior investigator and head of the Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section at NEI.

Chavala and his colleagues are planning a clinical trial to test the therapy in humans for degenerative retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.

The work was supported by grants EY021171, EY025667, EY025905, and EY025717 and NEI Intramural Research Program grants ZIAEY000450, ZIAEY000474 and ZIAEY000546.

1121,"The foods we eat on a regular basis influence the makeup of the bacteria -- both good and bad -- in our mouths. And researchers are finding that this collective of bacteria known as the oral microbiome likely plays a large role in our overall health, in addition to its previously known associations with tooth decay and periodontal disease.

Scientists from the University at Buffalo have shown how eating certain types of foods impacts the oral microbiome of postmenopausal women. They found that higher intake of sugary and high glycemic load foods -- like doughnuts and other baked goods, regular soft drinks, breads and non-fat yogurts -- may influence poor oral health and, perhaps, systemic health outcomes in older women due to the influence these foods have on the oral microbiome.

In a study in Scientific Reports, an open access journal from the publishers of Nature, the UB-led team investigated whether carbohydrates and sucrose, or table sugar, were associated with the diversity and composition of oral bacteria in a sample of 1,204 postmenopausal women using data from the Women's Health Initiative.

It is the first study to examine carbohydrate intake and the subgingival microbiome in a sample consisting exclusively of postmenopausal women. The study was unique in that the samples were taken from subgingival plaque, which occurs under the gums, rather than salivary bacteria.

""This is important because the oral bacteria involved in periodontal disease are primarily residing in the subgingival plaque,"" said study first author Amy Millen, PhD, associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health in UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions.

""Looking at measures of salivary bacteria might not tell us how oral bacteria relate to periodontal disease because we are not looking in the right environment within the mouth,"" she added.

The research team reported positive associations between total carbohydrates, glycemic load and sucrose and Streptococcus mutans, a contributor to tooth decay and some types of cardiovascular disease, a finding that confirms previous observations. But they also observed associations between carbohydrates and the oral microbiome that are not as well established.

The researchers observed Leptotrichia spp., which has been associated with gingivitis, a common gum disease, in some studies, to be positively associated with sugar intake. The other bacteria they identified as associated with carbohydrate intake or glycemic load have not been previously appreciated as contributing to periodontal disease in the literature or in this cohort of women, according to Millen.

""We examined these bacteria in relation to usual carbohydrate consumption in postmenopausal women across a wide variety of carbohydrate types: total carbohydrate intake, fiber intake, disaccharide intake, to simple sugar intake,"" Millen said. ""No other study had examined the oral bacteria in relation to such a broad array of carbohydrate types in one cohort. We also looked at associations with glycemic load, which is not well studied in relation to the oral microbiome.""

The key question now is what this all means for overall health, and that's not as easily understood just yet.

""As more studies are conducted looking at the oral microbiome using similar sequencing techniques and progression or development of periodontal disease over time, we might begin to make better inferences about how diet relates to the oral microbiome and periodontal disease,"" Millen said.",0
1122,"THURSDAY, Feb. 23, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- All those images of beautiful-looking people on social media can deflate a young person's self-image, but there may be an easy fix: limiting time spent on TikTok, Instagram and the like. A new Canadian study finds that teens and young adults who already had symptoms of anxiety or depression and who cut their social media usage by about 50% experienced a significant improvement in how they felt about their overall appearance in just a few weeks. They also felt better about their weight.

 “I don't think it completely surprised me,” said study co-author Helen Thai, a PhD student in the psychology department at McGill University in Montreal. Past research on traditional media and the impact of unattainable beauty and body ideals has obtained similar results, Thai suggested. “Not only are there celebrities and influencers on there, but it's also people within your social circle,” Thai said about social media, “which can make comparison a bit more easy.” The authors estimated that youth spend about six to eight hours each day on screens. A lot of that time is spent on social media sites, where they may see hundreds or thousands of images, internalizing them.

 In a news release about the study, lead author Gary Goldfield, a senior scientist with the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, said that whether people who already have body and mental health issues simply spend more time on social media or whether social media leads to greater issues had not been known. For this study, the researchers worked with 220 undergraduate students ages 17 to 25. About 76% were women, 23% men and 1% other. Participants needed to regularly use social media for at least two hours each day on their smartphones. “I think before asking the why, we wanted to ask who would be most vulnerable to it, and so that's specifically why we targeted youth who are at risk of body image concerns,” Thai said. These were students who had symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Each was asked to respond to statements about their appearance, such as “I’m pretty happy about the way I look” or “I am satisfied with my weight” on a 5-point scale at the start and end of the experiment. “Especially if you're feeling vulnerable and you don't think that great about yourself, seeing all these people who look, in your eyes, more beautiful than you or more whatever is just going to make you feel worse and worse,” said study co-author Chris Davis, a professor in the psychology department at Carleton University in Ottawa. During the first week, all participants were asked to use social media as they typically would. A screen-time tracking program measured their usage. After that, half were asked to use social media for no more than 60 minutes a day. The participants who were asked to restrict their social media usage got it down to 78 minutes a day on average. The control group averaged 188 minutes daily. After three weeks, those who reduced their social media usage had a significant improvement in how they regarded their overall appearance and body weight after the intervention, compared with the control group, which saw no significant change, the researchers said. Nancy Mramor, a psychologist in Pittsburgh, said that when you compare yourself to others, you’ll have a 50-50 chance of feeling bad about yourself. Mramor was not involved in this study. In everything, she said, it’s important to compare yourself only to yourself. That’s true of social media, sports performance, academics or social standing, she said. For example, don’t compare your weight to that of someone you see online but instead to what it was like for you last week. “Focusing on your inner feeling about yourself, rather than outside images creates an opportunity to see yourself from the inside out, not just the outside. When images are not fed to you on your phone, you have a breather to notice what is important to you,” Mramor said. For minors, the best way to limit social media is with extreme parental supervision, Mramor said. Block the sites on their phones that you think will be harmful.",0
1123,"After decades of relative neglect, star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes are finally getting their due. To gather insight into a critical aspect of brain development, a team of scientists examined the maturation of astrocytes in 3-D structures grown in culture dishes to resemble human brain tissue. The study, which confirms the lab-grown cells develop at the same rate as those found in human brains, was published in Neuron and funded in part by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

“This work addresses a significant gap in human brain research by providing an invaluable technique to investigate the role of astrocytes in both normal development and disease,” said NINDS program director Jill Morris, Ph.D.

In 2015, a team directed by Sergiu Pasca, M.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford University in California, and Ben Barres, M.D., Ph.D., a Stanford professor of neurobiology, published a method for taking adult skin cells, converting them to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and then growing them as 3-D clusters of brain cells called human cortical spheroids (hCSs). These hCSs, which closely resemble miniature versions of a particular brain region, can be grown for many months. The cells in the cluster eventually develop into neurons, astrocytes, and other cells found in the human brain.

“One of the challenges of studying the human brain is the difficulty of examining it at different stages of development,” Dr. Pasca said. “This is a system that tries to simulate brain development step by step.”

In the new study, Steven Sloan, a student in Stanford’s M.D./Ph.D. program, led a series of experiments comparing astrocytes from hCSs to those found in tissue from the developing and adult human brain. The team grew the hCSs for 20 months, one of the longest-ever studies of lab-grown human brain cells.

The results verified that the lab-grown cells change over time in a similar manner to cells taken directly from brain tissue during very early life, a critical time for brain growth. This process is considered critical for normal brain development and deviations are thought to cause a variety of neurological and mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. Creating hCSs using cells from patients could allow scientists to uncover the underlying developmental biology at the core of these disorders.

“The hCS system makes it possible to replay astrocyte development from any patient,” Dr. Barres said. “That’s huge. There’s no other way one could ever do that without this method.”

The current study showed that hCS-grown astrocytes develop at the same rate as those found in human brains, in terms of their gene activity, their shapes, and their functions. For example, astrocytes taken from hCSs that were less than six months old multiplied rapidly and were highly engaged in eliminating unnecessary connections between neurons, just like astrocytes in babies growing in the womb. But astrocytes grown in hCSs for more than nine months could not reproduce and removed significantly fewer of those connections, mirroring astrocytes in infants 6 to 12 months old. On the other hand, just like astrocytes from developing and adult brains, the early- and late-stage astrocytes from hCSs were equally effective at encouraging new connections to form between neurons.

“Astrocytes are not just bystanders in the brain,” Dr. Pasca said. “They’re not just there to keep neurons warm; they actually participate actively in neurological function.”

“Since astrocytes make up a greater proportion of brain cells in humans than in other species, it may reflect a greater need for astrocytes in normal human brain function, with more significant consequences when they don’t work correctly,” added David Panchision, Ph.D., program director at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which also helped fund the study.

The researchers caution that hCSs are only a model and lack many features of real brains. Moreover, certain genes that are active in fully mature astrocytes never switched on in the hCS-grown astrocytes, which they could conceivably do if the cells had more time to develop. To address this question, the researchers now hope to identify ways to produce mature brain cells more quickly. hCSs could also be used to scrutinize precisely what causes astrocytes to change over time and to screen drugs that might correct any differences that occur in brain disease.

“These are questions that are going to be very exciting to explore,” Dr. Barres said.

The study was funded by NINDS (NS081703), the National Institute of Mental Health (MH099555, MH107800, MH106261), the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (GM007365), the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (TR001085), the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, the MQ Fellow Award, and Stanford University.

1125,"An international team led by scientists at the National Institutes of Health is the first to discover a new way that cells fix an important and dangerous type of DNA damage known as a DNA-protein crosslink (DPC). The researchers found that a protein named ZATT can eliminate DPCs with the help of another protein, TDP2. Since DPCs form when individuals receive some types of cancer treatments, understanding how TDP2 and ZATT work together to repair the damage may improve the health outcomes of cancer patients. The findings were published in the journal Science.

Researchers knew that TDP2 was important for removing DPCs, but they did not know how it was directed to where it needed to work, according to corresponding author Scott Williams, Ph.D., deputy chief of the Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH. Williams and his team used a multi-pronged approach to identify ZATT as a new contributor to this process and determine how it guides TDP2 to DPCs so they can be repaired.

To visualize how these proteins choreograph DPC repair, one must first know how DPCs are created. Matthew Schellenberg, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author on the paper, said when DNA becomes tangled inside of cells, organisms use a protein called topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) to untangle it.

""Imagine your DNA is a giant ball of yarn,"" Schellenberg said. ""TOP2 cuts and reties individual threads to disentangle the ball.""

Schellenberg explained that TOP2 normally conceals its cut DNA ends within the core of the TOP2 protein that encircles DNA. Doing so ensures the protein can complete the second part of its job, which is rejoining DNA ends. However, chemotherapeutic drugs or environmental chemicals sometimes block the protein’s DNA-retying ability, so that TOP2 remains stuck on DNA. This situation creates a stable TOP2-DPC complex, which leads to the accumulation of severed DNA that kills cells.

Williams likened TOP2-DPCs to ticking time bombs for cells. He said these molecular charges are armed by TOP2’s interaction with environmental toxicants, chemical metabolites, tobacco exposures, or DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light.

He added that TOP2-DPCs are most potently formed by pharmaceutical drugs that humans exploit to eradicate cancer cells, making TOP2-DPCs double-edged swords. If they are not removed, they trigger cell death. While cancer drugs induce formation of TOP2-DPCs to treat cancer, TOP2-DPC lesions can also be the source of disease, as they can cause rearrangement of an organism’s genome that leads to cancer. For this reason, Williams and his colleagues said it was necessary to learn how DPCs are located and broken down.

""In this study, we discovered a new molecular disarmament apparatus for these cell-killing bombs,"" Williams said. ""ZATT is like a bomb sniffing dog, so when it locates its target, it sounds an alarm to mobilize the recruitment of TDP2, which cuts the red wire to disarm these threats.""

Schellenberg said chemotherapeutic drugs, such as etoposide, are not the only pharmaceuticals that induce DPCs. Many of the antibiotics that are currently on the market use the same method to damage bacterial DNA. He said this work was part of a larger effort to figure out how researchers can exploit this key vulnerability to improve health.

""We’ve discovered how we defend against this potent means of cell killing,"" Schellenberg said. ""It is our hope that this information will enable development of new drugs that target these defenses. By lowering the defenses, we may make drugs that kill cancer cells more effective.""

• A new study looked at eating avocados and the potential to improve metabolic factors.
• Researchers found people who ate one avocado a day had slightly lower cholesterol levels than the control group.
• Other measures, including body weight, BMI and insulin levels, were not significantly different between the two groups. Nearly 40 percent of Americans live with high cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This puts them at risk for heart disease and stroke, two leading causes of death in the U.S. New research this month in the Journal of the American Heart Association looked at whether or not eating one avocado per day could impact these levels. Researchers found a small but noticeable reduction in key cholesterol levels. “While one avocado a day did not lead to clinically significant improvements in abdominal fat and other cardiometabolic risk factors, consuming one avocado a day did not result in body weight gain,” study author Joan Sabate, MD, professor at Loma Linda University School of Public Health, said in a statement.

Called the Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT), the study was designed to test whether consuming one large avocado per day for 6 months in a diverse group of about 1,000 people with an elevated waist circumference would decrease belly fat compared with those who ate their habitual diet. The study received funding from the Avocado Nutrition Center, which supports research on avocado nutrition health. Researchers provided participants with written instructions describing how to ripen, cut, remove the pit of, and peel avocados and serving ideas and recipes containing avocados. No additional dietary counseling or guidance was provided. The group given a daily avocado was called the Avocado Supplemented Diet Group; the other group that continued their usual diet was called the Habitual Diet Group. Sabate and team found the group that avocado eaters experienced “modest but nominally significant” reductions in total and LDL cholesterol compared to the habitual diet group. They pointed out that fiber in avocados may contribute to lower cholesterol levels. “The between‐group differences in total cholesterol and LDL‐C align with the observed dietary fiber differences between groups,” the authors wrote, pointing out that a single avocado can have about 3.3 g of soluble fiber. Other measurements that included body weight, body mass index (BMI), and insulin were similar between the two groups. “LDL is also known as the bad cholesterol which can build up plaque in the blood vessels of the body,” Aeshita Dwivedi, MD, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told Healthline.

He emphasized that the observed reduction in cholesterol wasn’t significant enough to improve heart health. When asked about the government’s , Dwivedi said they’re “good to follow.” “It is important to discuss your diet with your doctor and or a nutritionist so it can be tailored to the medical conditions and medications that you take,” Dwivedi added. Dwivedi found the study interesting but acknowledged that dietary studies are “tough to perform.” “This study tested a simple hypothesis which did not seem to make clinically significant changes,“ he said. “Following a moderate, sustainable and balance lifestyle is the key to good health.”

“For many folks, it would be great if a simple step like eating one avocado a day could significantly reduce LDL levels; however, there’s no one ‘magic pill’ for good heart health,” said Michael Chan, MD, an interventional cardiologist with Providence St. Jude Medical Center in Southern California. He pointed out that the key to maintaining heart health comes down to focusing on fundamentals that include: “The study showed that simply adding one large avocado a day to your diet for six months does not make a significant difference in reducing your total body fat levels and had minimal impact on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels,” said Chan. “This was essentially a negative study.” Chan recommended a diet rich in vegetables and fruits to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. This includes legumes such as lentils, lima beans, chickpeas, soybeans, kidney beans, and whole grains like oatmeal, buckwheat, and barley. Chan said lean protein like fish with high omega-3 fatty acids could also help. “Avoid red meat, shellfish, whole milk products and limiting saturated, and trans fats would be ”rudent,” he cautioned.",0

All SARS-CoV-2 isolated from humans to date are closely related genetically to coronaviruses isolated from bat populations, specifically, bats from the genus Rhinolophus. SARS-CoV, the cause of the SARS outbreak in 2003, is also closely related to coronaviruses isolated from bats. These close genetic relations suggest that they all have their ecological origin in bat populations. Bats in the Rhinolophus genus are found across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. SARS-CoV-2 is not genetically related to other known coronaviruses found in farmed or domestic animals. The analysis of the virus genome sequences also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is very well adapted to human cell receptors, which enables it to invade human cells and easily infect people. All the published genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human cases are very similar, suggesting that the start of the outbreak resulted from a single point introduction in the human population around the time that the virus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China. The analyses of the published genetic sequences further suggest that the spillover from an animal source to humans happened during the last quarter of 2019.

1134,"Better mouse model built to enable precision-medicine research for Alzheimer's

Incorporating genetic diversity into a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease resulted in greater overlap with the genetic, molecular and clinical features of this pervasive human disease, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study also suggests that adding genetic diversity may be key to improving the predictive power of studies using mouse models and increasing their usability for precision medicine research for Alzheimer’s. This research comes out of the newly established Resilience-Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (Resilience-AD) and was published online Dec. 27, 2018 in the journal Neuron.

“This is the first study to show that you can replicate many of the molecular features of Alzheimer’s disease in a genetically diverse mouse model,” said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D. “It points to a strategy for better use of mouse models for precision medicine research—both basic and translational—for Alzheimer’s disease.”

Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. As many as 5.5 million Americans age 65 and older are estimated to be living with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia.

A key tool among the multiple efforts to find a treatment or cure for Alzheimer’s, mouse models allow researchers to explore genetic, molecular and even behavioral aspects of disease that can’t be done in humans. The researchers, led by Catherine C. Kaczorowski, Ph.D., an associate professor and Evnin Family Chair in Alzheimer’s Research at the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and her graduate student, first author Sarah Neuner, noted that mouse models with Alzheimer’s mutations are important for defining high-risk as well as protective genes and disease mechanisms, and to efficiently test new potential interventions and therapeutics.

In this study, the researchers tested the idea that including more real-world genetic variation into a mouse model of Alzheimer’s would improve the translatability of the model—meaning that findings would be more likely to parallel the many complex features of the human disease. To do this, they combined a well-established mouse model of familial Alzheimer’s (5XFAD) with a genetically diverse set of mice. All members of this family of transgenic mice therefore carry the high-risk human familial Alzheimer’s genes but otherwise have very different genetic make-up. The detailed analysis of this new panel of mice (referred collectively as AD-BXD), showed a high degree of overlap with the genetic, molecular, pathologic and cognitive features of Alzheimer’s. Moreover, in the presence of identical Alzheimer’s risk genes, the differences in genetic background led to profound differences in the onset and severity of the pathologic and cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s.

Through a series of comparative analyses, the research team also discovered that one mouse strain, C57BL/6J, commonly used to generate Alzheimer’s transgenic mouse models, harbors resilience factors that lessen the impact of Alzheimer’s risk factor genes. This new finding has two important implications. First, it suggests that Alzheimer’s mouse models with this genetic background may not be suitable for testing of novel therapeutic agents and may explain the poor predictive power of drug screening studies using the current Alzheimer’s transgenic mouse models. Second, by using the AD-BXD panel, the protective genes from the C57BL/6J strain and their mechanisms can be precisely identified leading to new candidate targets for Alzheimer’s prevention.

The authors noted that the AD-BXD panel represents a new tool for better understanding the heterogeneous nature of normal aging and Alzheimer’s, and for precisely identifying molecular factors that lead to resilience to genetic and environmental disease risk factors.

“The ability to model genetic diversity and its impact on multiple aspects of disease risk and resilience in transgenic mice in a robust and reproducible way will enable the research community to learn a lot more about the complex nature of Alzheimer’s a lot faster,” said Suzana Petanceska, Ph.D., program director in the NIA Division of Neuroscience, who oversees the Resilience-AD program. “This new resource adds to the series of new NIA/NIH programs generating data, analytical and research tools needed to enable more efficient and predictive drug development for Alzheimer’s.”

Kaczorowski’s team is one of 10 multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research teams supported through the Resilience-AD program, one of a series of NIA-supported open-science consortia. Resilience-AD, launched in 2017, aims to address why and how some individuals remain dementia-free despite being at high genetic or biomarker risk of Alzheimer’s. The program was developed to generate deeper mechanistic understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interact and lead to cognitive resilience in individuals who are at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease and to identify novel therapeutic targets for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic prevention strategies.

1137,"The complex sugars found in human breastmilk, long believed to be fixed in their composition, may change in women who are taking probiotics, according to new research from the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC).

The finding, published in a research letter in JAMA Pediatrics, upends what scientists thought of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) -- the sugar molecules found exclusively in human breast milk -- and could lead to future studies on how the compounds can be potentially influenced by diet and other factors.

Though HMOs are indigestible for a newborn child, they are consumed by certain species in the microbiome and can significantly affect its composition. As a result, scientists have begun focusing on HMOs as a possible reason that infants who consume breastmilk are less likely to get certain viral and bacterial infections, and other severe conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, along with allergic diseases like food allergy.

""HMOs were thought to be genetically determined, almost like your blood type,"" said Antti Seppo, Ph.D., research associate professor of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology at URMC and the letter's lead author. ""But this data shows you can manipulate the HMOs by external factors.""

""We thought the interaction between HMOs and the microbiome was a one-way street, with HMOs shaping microbial communities by acting as prebiotics,"" said Lars Bode, Ph.D., associate professor of Pediatrics at the University of California San Diego, who co-authored the letter. ""Here, we have the first example suggesting that maternal dietary microbes, in the form of probiotics, shape HMO compositions.""

The study analyzed data from 81 pregnant women who were enrolled in a probiotic supplementation study in Finland. The researchers then compared 20 different HMOs in the two groups of women -- those taking probiotics and those that were not.

Future studies could potentially look at the effect of specific types of probiotics and food groups on specific HMOs, allowing for customization and clinical application tailored to optimize HMO composition in a disease specific way.

""Because HMOs may be linked to development of food allergies in an infant, manipulating HMO composition favorably could open up a new avenue for prevention of food allergies,"" said Kirsi Jarvinen-Seppo, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology at URMC and senior co-author on the paper.",0

1143,"University of Granada researchers have identified four plant extracts that might help in preventing and fighting obesity. The researchers identified the most effective plant extracts through in vitro assays; subsequently, extracts were tested on rats. While the results obtained are promising, further studies on animals are required to evaluate and confirm the anti-obesity effects of these extracts. Once their anti-obesity effects are confirmed on animals, the extracts will be tested on humans.

In vitro assays revealed that two of these extracts -which name cannot be disclosed for confidentiality reasons- inhibited the activity of one of the key enzymes involved in the breakdown of dietary lipids, which would eventually reduce lipid absorption.

In addition, cell assays revealed that another two extracts induced the hydrolysis ​​of the triglycerides accumulated within fat cells, thus reducing their fat content.

The effects of these extracts were tested on animals. To carry out this study, Wistar rats were used as a model for study of the absorption of a fat-rich diet, and Zucker rats -characterized for being obese rats- were used as a model for studying the effects of these extracts on body weight and plasma lipid levels in obese animals.

Two extracts were selected as they demonstrated to have potential inhibiting effects on dietary fat absorption. Rats were fed with a fat-rich diet supplemented with these extracts during three days; they showed a 6-8% increase in the fat excreted in feces, as compared to the fat excreted by rats fed with a fat-rich diet without any supplementary extract. The results suggest that this extract inhibits fat absorption.

Subsequently, obese rats were administered the two extracts that were found to reduce cell fat contents during ten weeks; lipid concentrations in plasma improved as did the parameters associated with the metabolism of glucose -which is related with diabetes and obesity.

Dietary administration of one of these extracts to obese rats significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma by 67 and 49% respectively, as compared to a control group of obese rats that received no extracts. also Glucose and insulin levels in plasma were also significantly improved. Another extract reduced free fatty acid levels in plasma by 68%, as compared to a control group of obese rats receiving no extract.

This research study was conducted by Belén San Román Arenas, at the Biosearch Life Department of Research, in collaboration with the professor at the University of Granada Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II Olga Martínez Augustín, and coordinated by doctors Mónica Olivares Martín and Óscar Bañuelos Hortigüela.

According to the researchers, the introduction of any drug in food is banned by current national regulations. However, it is legal that food is enriched with natural compounds that are commonly consumed by humans. Accordingly, as the extracts selected for this study come from vegetables commonly consumed by humans, they can be used as nutritional supplements or added to food, once their effectiveness is tested and verified on humans.",0
1144,"Diabetes, which affects millions of people worldwide, develops when the body either generates insufficient amounts of the hormone insulin- a hormone that maintains healthy blood sugar -- or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. When the number of beta cells is too low or they aren't functioning properly, there isn't enough insulin getting released. Beta cells communicate with each other to secrete insulin in a coordinated manner. An international team of scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany, the Paul Langerhans Institute Dresden (PLID), and the Universities of Oulu, Finland and Copenhagen, Denmark now shows that the gene Wnt4 in beta cells enables them to sense glucose and release the hormone insulin that enables other cells in the body to store glucose. These insights could help to create replacement beta cells for diabetes therapy in the future.

At birth, a baby starts to eat food and turns it into energy. Many nutrients can be converted to sugar (glucose) and be released into the bloodstream. Higher blood sugar levels signal the beta cells in the pancreas to release insulin, which lets the blood sugar into the cells to use or store it as energy. However, at different stages of life, the food-sensing beta cells need to adapt to different foods and needs. In a recent study in Nature Communications, Anne Grapin-Botton, director at MPI-CBG, and her team in Dresden and at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology in Copenhagen, Denmark, together with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus of the Technische Universität Dresden found that the gene Wnt4 becomes active in food-sensing beta cells as they mature in early postnatal life.

How it all began

The discovery of the role of Wnt4 in the development of a pancreas started in the 1990s at Harvard University, when Anne Grapin-Botton, a postdoctoral researcher at that time, discussed with Seppo Vainio, now a research unit leader at the University of Oulu. ""I remember that when I worked with Wnt4 in kidney development, we speculated that this signal would have a role in the development of the pancreas too,"" says Seppo Vainio. But the researchers were lacking the right tools at that time. Over 20 years later, postdoctoral researcher Keiichi Katsumoto in the lab of Anne Grapin-Botton was keen on finding out what function the gene Wnt4 has in pancreas development. In the meantime, the lab of Vainio at Oulu had further developed their mouse models: ""With all these tools, we could target Wnt4 function in pancreas development and physiology with Anne Grapin-Botton's research lab,"" says Seppo Vainio.

Keiichi Katsumoto describes what he observed, ""We found that the gene Wnt4 is expressed in beta cells during the maturation of the cell. The cells that start expressing Wnt4 stop proliferating and become more functional. We saw that with less Wnt4, the beta cell secretes less insulin."" The team found that even though the beta cells were able to detect sugar in the blood, they secreted less insulin in response to glucose.

""When we saw that mice without the gene Wnt4 were becoming diabetic, we knew we had found something important, but we did not understand how it was acting,"" says Anne Grapin-Botton, who supervised this study. ""We understood from work in other organs, notably our collaborator Seppo Vainio and his colleagues, that this gene is a signal sent by cells to others. It was exciting to find communication between beta cells in the pancreas, its conservation across several animal species and the mechanisms by which it operates, notably the profound metabolic changes it provokes in beta cells. However, we do not understand yet if beta cells release Wnt4 constantly or under special circumstances. This will be something, we want to explore in the future.""

""The results also suggest that the increase of Wnt4 shortly after birth enables beta cells to mature,"" says Katsumoto. Our next step is to understand why Wnt4 becomes expressed as the cells mature."" Those results could support the development replacement beta cells for diabetes therapy with added Wnt4 to promote maturation.",0
1145,"More than one million U.S. children fractured a bone while riding a bicycle over the past 20 years, and most of them were boys between ages 10 to 15 years old, according to research presented during the 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition.

Authors of the abstract, ""Pediatric Fractures Associated with Riding Bicycles: A National Twenty-Year Analysis,"" found that, despite efforts to make roads more bike-friendly, over 65,000 injuries occurred in an accident involving a motor vehicle. About 85% of children who sustained a skull fracture while riding bicycles were not wearing helmets.

""The results of our study suggest that continued efforts teaching road safety and promoting helmet use should be targeted towards all children, but with additional efforts being directed towards the most affected population, namely 10- to 15-year-old boys,"" said J. Todd R. Lawrence, MD, PhD, at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Municipalities should continue to evaluate traffic patterns on their local roads to improve bike safety for children.""

The researchers examined information provided in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database for the years 2001 through 2020 to identify patients ages 18 or younger who showed up at U.S. emergency departments with fractures associated with bicycles. They found an average 50,975 fractures reported annually, with about 71% of patients being male. Only a small minority of patients with skull fractures were wearing helmets; nearly 87% of patients were not wearing helmets at the time of the skull fracture.

While the number of fractures from children riding bicycles has decreased over the past two decades, researchers noted an increase in fractures in 2020 that is consistent with literature showing a significant increase in other injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is potentially due to an increased use of bicycles from stay-at-home orders and cancellation of school and summer camps.

""Given the results of our study, we recommend targeting bicycle safety efforts toward the most affected populations, largely 10- to 15-year-old boys,"" said William Huffman, a medical student. ""Teaching road and helmet safety for bicycle riders is paramount to keeping children safe.""",0
1146,"In a study publishing in the journal Cell Stem Cell on February 2, researchers show that brain organoids -- clumps of lab-grown neurons -- can integrate with rat brains and respond to visual stimulation like flashing lights.

Decades of research has shown that we can transplant individual human and rodent neurons into rodent brains, and, more recently, it has been demonstrated that human brain organoids can integrate with developing rodent brains. However, whether these organoid grafts can functionally integrate with the visual system of injured adult brains has yet to be explored.

""We focused on not just transplanting individual cells, but actually transplanting tissue,"" says senior author H. Isaac Chen, a physician and Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Brain organoids have architecture; they have structure that resembles the brain. We were able to look at individual neurons within this structure to gain a deeper understanding of the integration of transplanted organoids.""

The researchers cultivated human stem cell-derived neurons in the lab for around 80 days before grafting them into the brains of adult rats that had sustained injuries to their visual cortex. Within three months, the grafted organoids had integrated with their host's brain: becoming vascularized, growing in size and number, sending out neuronal projections, and forming synapses with the host's neurons.

The team made use of fluorescent-tagged viruses that hop along synapses, from neuron to neuron, to detect and trace physical connections between the organoid and brain cells of the host rat. ""By injecting one of these viral tracers into the eye of the animal, we were able to trace the neuronal connections downstream from the retina,"" says Chen. ""The tracer got all the way to the organoid.""

Next, the researchers used electrode probes to measure the activity of individual neurons within the organoid when the animals were exposed to flashing lights and alternating white and black bars. ""We saw that a good number of neurons within the organoid responded to specific orientations of light, which gives us evidence that these organoid neurons were able to not just integrate with the visual system, but they were able to adopt very specific functions of the visual cortex.""

The team was surprised by the degree to which the organoids were able to integrate within only three months. ""We were not expecting to see this degree of functional integration so early,"" says Chen. ""There have been other studies looking at transplantation of individual cells that show that even 9 or 10 months after you transplant human neurons into a rodent, they're still not completely mature.""

""Neural tissues have the potential to rebuild areas of the injured brain,"" says Chen. ""We haven't worked everything out, but this is a very solid first step. Now, we want to understand how organoids could be used in other areas of the cortex, not just the visual cortex, and we want to understand the rules that guide how organoid neurons integrate with the brain so that we can better control that process and make it happen faster.""",0

1149,"NIH-funded ClinGen panel also validates three genes believed to be associated with Long QT syndrome.

Geneticists and heart specialists around the world had previously reported 17 genes to cause long QT syndrome, a little-known inherited heart condition. However, the Clinical Genome Resource’s (ClinGen) expert panel has critically reevaluated the scientific evidence for all 17 reported genes, disputing nine of the genes and revealing only three of the genes to be definitively associated with the most common form of the disease. The work was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the National Institutes of Health.

ClinGen is an NHGRI-funded resource that defines the clinical relevance or validity of genes in various genetic disorders for their use in precision medicine and research. Nine other genes have been classified as having limited or disputed evidence for causing the syndrome. Their results were published in Circulation, the peer-reviewed journal of The American Heart Association.

Twenty years ago, The New York Times published an article about three “apparently healthy” young people who died in seemingly mysterious ways, while sleeping, swimming and after playing soccer. In 2019, about 4,000 children and young adults died in the United States in similar, unusual ways. The apparent cause was long QT syndrome.

Long QT syndrome is caused by mutations in genes that regulate the heart’s electrical activity. These mutations can cause the heart to have sudden, irregular heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. Much like the cases in the New York Times article, people with long QT syndrome can have arrythmias that are both unprovoked or a result of stress and exercise. But when the arrythmias do occur, they can be fatal.

Many people with long QT syndrome may be unaware they have the condition, unless they get an unrelated electrocardiogram, know their family history and have undergone genetic testing. The term “QT” refers to the segment of an electrocardiogram which measures the duration of time for the heart to relax after a heartbeat. In long QT syndrome, that duration of time is abnormally prolonged and creates a vulnerability to dangerous arrhythmias.

Ever since the syndrome was described in 1957, researchers have engaged in a genetic race to identify the genes associated with long QT syndrome, which currently includes 17 genes.

By using such a standardized, evidence-based framework, the international ClinGen panel experts on long QT syndrome were able to classify the 17 genes into specific groups.

Three genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, had sufficient evidence to be implicated as “definitive” genetic causes for typical long QT syndrome. Four other genes had strong or definitive evidence supporting their role in causing atypical forms of long QT syndrome, presenting in the newborn period with associated heart block, seizures or delays in development. The remaining ten genes did not have sufficient evidence to support a causal role in the syndrome. In fact, nine of these 10 remaining genes were placed in the limited or disputed category. The study authors suggest that these genes not be routinely tested in clinical settings when evaluating patients and families with long QT syndrome, because they lack sufficient scientific evidence for causing for this condition.

ClinGen as an essential resource in precision medicine

Genetic testing providers use research papers to determine which genes to include in their testing panels for diagnostic reporting to physicians. Published papers reporting gene-disease associations vary widely in their study design and strength of evidence to support their conclusions. Until recently, standard guidelines that can differentiate between genes found with strong and valid scientific approaches versus those with insufficient evidence did not exist.

NHGRI developed the ClinGen resource to address this very issue.

ClinGen’s expert panels include researchers, clinicians and genetic counselors who apply an evidence-based framework in evaluating the scientific evidence from research papers to place gene-disease relationships into “definitive,” “strong,” “moderate,” “limited,” “disputed” or “refuted” categories.

“ClinGen is an impressive community effort. With over 1,000 researchers and clinicians from 30 countries volunteering their time and expertise, ClinGen is providing much needed clarity for the clinical genomics community regarding which gene-disease pairs have sufficient evidence to be used clinically,” said Erin Ramos, Ph.D., project scientist for ClinGen and program director in the Division of Genomic Medicine at NHGRI.

“Our study highlights the need to take a step back and to critically evaluate the level of evidence for all reported gene-disease associations, especially when applying genetic testing for diagnostic purposes in our patients. Testing genes with insufficient evidence to support disease causation only creates a risk of inappropriately interpreting the genetic information and leading to patient harm,” says Michael Gollob, M.D., senior author of the paper and researcher at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute.

Moreover, testing for genes not definitively associated with long QT syndrome can result in inappropriate and costly medical interventions such as implanting of a cardioverter-defibrillator, a heart device that can correct dangerous arrhythmias.

ClinGen researchers published a similar study in 2018, covering another heart condition called Brugada syndrome. In 2019, the American Society of Human Genetics considered the paper as one of the top 10 advances in genomic medicine.

With over 20 expert panels working on different diseases — breast and ovarian cancer, glaucoma and familial hypercholesterolemia to name a few — periodic classification of a number of gene-disease pairs is aimed to accelerate development of reliable and useful genetic tests over time.

1150,"The yeast Candida albicans can cause itchy, painful urinary tract and vaginal yeast infections. For women in low-resource settings who lack access to healthcare facilities, these infections create substantial social and economic burdens. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Omega have developed color-changing threads that turn bright pink in the presence of C. albicans. When embedded in tampons or sanitary napkins, they could allow women to quickly and discreetly self-diagnose vulvovaginal yeast infections, the researchers say.

According to the Mayo Clinic, about 75% of women will experience a yeast infection, or vulvovaginal candidiasis, at least once in their lifetime. Although women in high-resource areas can easily be diagnosed with a vaginal swab at their doctor's office and then treated with an antifungal medication, many women throughout the world lack access to basic healthcare facilities. Moreover, in some resource-limited areas, societal taboos cause women to feel shame or embarrassment about the symptoms, which prevents them from seeking a doctor's care. Therefore, Naresh Kumar Mani and colleagues wanted to develop an inexpensive method that could be integrated into menstrual hygiene products, allowing women to quickly, easily and discreetly self-diagnose yeast infections.

The researchers began with ordinary multifilament cotton threads purchased at a local craft store. To increase the wicking properties of the threads, the team treated them with a heptane solution that removed waxes and binders added during manufacturing. Then, the threads were coated with a molecule called L-proline ?-naphthylamide (PRO) -- the substrate for an enzyme secreted by C. albicans -- and embedded in the inner layers of sanitary napkins and pads. When the researchers added simulated vaginal fluid spiked with C. albicans and an indicator solution, the spots of the napkins or pads containing yeast changed to a bright pink color. The detection time was only 10 minutes, compared with 24-72 hours for conventional tests. In addition, the new test costs only 22 to 28 cents per napkin or tampon, and it could easily be adapted to simultaneously detect other pathogens, such as bacteria that also can cause urinary tract infections, the researchers say.",0
1151,"Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a new method for scheduling radiation therapy that could be up to 22% more effective at killing cancer cells. Traditional approaches to scheduling radiation therapy assume that all cancer cells are the same, but recent research shows that tumors contain different cell types including cancer stem cells, which are more resistant to radiation. The new algorithm developed by the researchers allows doctors to predict how a tumor will respond to treatment by taking into account the differing radiation resistances of stem cells and non-stem cells. Although the model has limitations, it provides a better starting point for treatment research by highlighting the importance of heterogeneity in tumors in planning treatment. The next step is to apply the algorithm to clinical studies and see if it outperforms existing scheduling practices.",1
1152,"April 18, 2023 – A new federal research project aims to answer lingering questions about long COVID using mobile monitoring devices to help track the condition. The federally funded RECOVER Initiative expects to give out 10,000 sensors to people with long COVID to collect data in real time. The hope is that researchers will be able to provide doctors, and patients, with a wealth of information to address gaps in knowledge about long COVID. The project takes advantage of the approach other researchers have used to track patients’ health data on heart rate, exercise, and more using mobile monitoring devices, such as Fitbits, smartwatches, and other remote sensors. Researchers believe the initiative could be particularly useful for people with long COVID – whose symptoms come and go. They can use a wristband sensor to passively collect data in real time. For a condition defined by its symptoms, that kind of data promises to be useful, experts said. But not everyone has room in their budget for a smartwatch or a fitness tracker. Until recently, most clinical trials were BYOD: Bring your own device. At a time when researchers are trying to make sure that clinical trials reflect the diversity of the population, that leaves a lot of people out. So researchers are starting to supply subjects with their own monitors. The RECOVER Initiative expects to give out 10,000 sensors to people who are eligible based on race/ethnicity, income, and other demographic factors (rural residents for example). After 2 months, all people in the RECOVER study over the age of 13 will be eligible for the sensors. The federal program builds on earlier research at places like The Scripps Institute, a center of research into remote monitoring. The institute supplied 7,000 monitors to people in an arm of the All of Us study, a 5-year-old multi-site cohort that aims to collect medical information from 1 million people. The devices went to people who have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research, said Scripps researchers, who plan to give out more this year.

Last month, Vanderbilt University researchers published a study on the tracking data that found a significant post-COVID-19 drop in physical activity. But the data is incomplete because many people can’t always afford these devices. Most of the people in the study were “White, young, and active,” they wrote. Researchers at an “All of Us” site at Vanderbilt University, which also used a Bring your Own Device approach, realized that they produced biased results. They reported their findings at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in January. “[The] majority of participants who provided Fitbit data reported being white and employed for wages,” they said. “However, these data represent participants who had their own Fitbit devices and consented to share EHR [electronic health record] data.” Their solution: The program has begun providing Fitbit devices to all study participants who do not own one or cannot afford one. Now, the web page for the All of Us study asks visitors to “Learn about the All of Us WEAR study. You could get a Fitbit at no cost! … As a part of the WEAR Study, you could receive a new Fitbit to wear at no cost to you. All of Us will be able to get the data the Fitbit collects. This data may help us understand how behavior impacts health.” Jennifer Radin, PhD, an epidemiologist at Scripps Research Translational Institute, is heading up the DETECT Study, which is a remote monitoring research project that has enrolled over 40,000 people who have their own sensors – be it a smartwatch or Fitbit. She was looking at remote monitoring for disease before COVID emerged. Radin said she began researching remote sensing after working in public health and dealing with outdated data collection systems. “They typically rely on case reports that are recorded by pen and paper and faxed or mailed in,” she said. “Then, they have to be entered into a database."" DETECT collects data on resting heart rate, which is unique to every person, and activity levels. Both measures are meaningful for those with long COVID. Her research found differences in sleep, heart rate, and activity between those with COVID and those without.

Along with offering objective data on a subject’s response to the infection, she said, the data collection can be long-term and continuous. Joseph Kvedar, MD, is a Harvard Medical School researcher and the editor of NPJ Digital Medicine. He’s been studying digital health systems and called clinical research a “beachhead” for the use of data from monitors. But he also said problems remain that need to be worked out. The quality of the devices and their Bluetooth connections are better. But different devices measure different things, and a counted step can vary from person to person, he said. And the problems of the early days of electronic health records have not been fully resolved. “We haven’t gotten to this universal language to connect all these things and make them relevant,“ he said. The All of Us researchers are working with the RECOVER project to address some of those issues. Usually not focused on a single condition, the All of Us researchers are testing a machine-learning approach for identifying long COVID.",0

The study found that only young adults showed a strong EEG recognition response to reminders of a mock crime, while such responses were absent in the older group, even though they had the same knowledge about the crime as the younger group. The research suggests that EEG-based forensic memory detection tests have limited practical applications with less validity in older adults than younger populations.

1157,"Curious to know if you're at risk for two common heart conditions? Your doctor may want to check the shape of your heart.

Investigators from the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai have discovered that patients who have round hearts shaped like baseballs are more likely to develop future heart failure and atrial fibrillation than patients who have longer hearts shaped like the traditional Valentine heart.

Their findings, published in Med -- Cell Press' new peer-reviewed medical journal -- used deep learning and advanced imaging analysis to study the genetics of heart structure. Their results were telling.

""We found that individuals with spherical hearts were 31% more likely to develop atrial fibrillation and 24% more likely to develop cardiomyopathy, a type of heart muscle disease,"" said David Ouyang, MD, a cardiologist in the Smidt Heart Institute and a researcher in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

The risk was identified after investigators analyzed cardiac MRI images from 38,897 healthy individuals from the UK Biobank. Using this same database, researchers then used computational models to identify genetic markers of the heart that are associated with these cardiac conditions.

""By looking at the genetics of sphericity, we found four genes associated with cardiomyopathy: PLN, ANGPT1, PDZRN3, and HLA DR/DQ,"" said Ouyang. ""The first three of these genes were also associated with a greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation.""

Atrial fibrillation, the most common type of abnormal heart rhythm disorder, greatly increases a person's risk of having a stroke. The condition is rising in prevalence and projected to affect 12.1 million people in the U.S. by 2030.

Cardiomyopathy is a type of heart muscle disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body and can eventually lead to heart failure. The main types of cardiomyopathies -- dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic and restrictive -- affect as many as 1 of every 500 adults.

Cedars-Sinai cardiologists say the shape of one's heart changes over years, typically becoming rounder over time and especially after a major cardiac event like a heart attack.

""A change in the heart's shape may be a first sign of disease,"" said Christine M. Albert, MD, MPH, chair of the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and a study author. ""Understanding how a heart changes when faced with illness -- coupled with now having more reliable and intuitive imaging to support this knowledge -- is a critical step in prevention for two life-altering diseases.""

Ouyang says the findings provide more clarity on the potential use of cardiac imaging to diagnose more effectively -- and prevent -- many conditions. He also emphasized the need for additional studies.

""Large biobanks with cardiac imaging data now offer an opportunity to analyze and define variation in cardiac structure and function that was not possible using traditional approaches,"" said Ouyang. ""Deep learning and computer vision also allow for faster as well as more comprehensive cardiac measures that may help to identify genetic variations affecting a heart -- up to years or even decades before any obvious heart disease develops.""",0

1159,"As a research trainee in the Department of Neurosurgery, Thirusivapragas (Siva) Subramaniam, M.B.B.S., had long known that a small lump near a patient’s belly button can indicate certain types of cancer.

While the term for this clinical finding – Sister Mary Joseph Nodule – is standard throughout the world, the story behind the name is less well known.

Through a series of events that he describes as “a miraculous thing,” Dr. Subramaniam researched the origin of the term and published his findings in Journal of Clinical Anatomy. The project spanned his work as a research trainee in the Department of Neurosurgery from 2019-2020 and, currently, as a visiting scientist in the surgical innovation section of the Department of Surgery.

In this interview, he shares the back story of his discoveries while writing his article, “Sister Mary Joseph nodule and the mystery behind its nomenclature.”

“As I opened the door to my office on the eighth floor of the Gonda Building, a medical textbook fell off the shelf. It landed on my desk with the page open to ‘Sister Mary Joseph Nodule.’”

What did you think when you saw the book fall open to a reference for this condition?

The timing was amazing. I had taken a Sunday stroll the day before and ended up in front of the Gonda Building where there are statues of Dr. William Worrall Mayo and Mother Alfred Moes (Feith Family Statuary Park). I stood there admiring those two great people with utmost respect and admiration.

My attention went toward Mother Alfred Moes. I thought of the great love and care that Catholic Sisters have for humanity. Having worked at the Mother Teresa Hospital in Vellore, India, early in my surgical practice, I admire the devotion that women of the cloth have for people of all backgrounds. We live in a world where selfless work is not given much recognition. At that moment, I wanted to write or do something that would express appreciation to people who live such dedicated lives.

The next morning, when the book fell in front of me with the page open to Sister Mary Joseph Nodule, it seemed like destiny. I looked up Sister Mary Joseph on a search engine. Even though I’ve known about the nodule since medical school, I never realized its name had any connection with Mayo Clinic until that moment. I asked some of the international research trainees with whom I share the office. They all knew about the Sister Mary Joseph Nodule, but none of them knew it was named after a person at Mayo Clinic. I had the same experience with several other colleagues I asked.

Who was Sister Mary Joseph and why is the nodule associated with her?

Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey was the superintendent of Saint Marys Hospital and, for about 25 years, she served as the first surgical assistant to Dr. William J. Mayo, who specialized in gastric operations.

She observed this sign in patients with cancer of the stomach, pancreas, urinary tract, female reproductive organs and sometimes cancer of the lungs, and called it to the attention of Dr. Mayo. Sister Joseph and Dr. Mayo referred to her finding it as “pants button umbilicus” because the nodule resembles a button on a pair of trousers.

What did you discover as you investigated this topic?

The connection – The term Sister Mary Joseph Nodule was coined by a British surgeon named Hamilton Bailey, who first used it in the 11th edition of his book, “Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery.” Bailey’s work is a classic, known as the “Bible of surgery” in the U.K. and all commonwealth nations. I’m a British physician, so his book was a key part of my medical education. An even closer connection – I was trained by several physicians and professors who were students of Hamilton Bailey.

The mystery – Bailey coined the term in the 1949 edition of his book, which was published a decade after Sister Mary Joseph and both Mayo brothers died. Bailey never visited Mayo Clinic or had any interactions with Sister Mary Joseph or Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie. I was puzzled about how the name “Sister Mary Joseph” travelled across the Atlantic to be used as a medical term by a person who had absolutely no connection with Mayo Clinic, which led me to research and write the article.

The surprise – I learned that Hamilton Bailey experienced mental illness at the time this edition of his book was being developed. His wife, Veta (also called Vera), was instrumental in revising the manuscript prior to its publication in 1949.

What have been the outcomes of your research?

During review of the archival sources, I realized Mayo did not have a copy of Bailey’s 1949 edition. Staff in the W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine and W. Bruce Fye History of Medicine Library were able to locate a copy to add to the institutional collection, so I’m honored that this article helped bring the first published reference of Sister Mary Joseph Nodule “home” to Mayo Clinic.

In the journey of this research, I came to understand the ethos of Mayo Clinic from the collaboration of Dr. W.W. Mayo and Mother Alfred Moes in 1883 to the present time. The story of Sister Mary Joseph is emblematic of what Mayo stands for. So are the wonderful people I met, who are listed in the acknowledgments of the article. Above all, I wish to thank my present supervisor, Jordan Miller, Ph.D., for granting me permission to write this article.

As Mahatma Gandhi said, “It is the individual self-discipline and character which cumulatively makes an institution or a nation worthy of praise and greatness.” During this project, I was able to witness through many wonderful people, past and present, why Mayo Clinic is so esteemed in the world.

Lower brain glucose levels may not indicate less severe Alzheimer’s disease. This is based on a study supported by the National Institute on Aging and published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. The researchers found abnormalities in glycolysis, the process by which the brain breaks down glucose, in the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer's disease. Higher rates of glycolysis and lower brain glucose levels correlated to less severe plaques and tangles in the brain. Insulin is necessary for glucose uptake and utilization in the brain, which is relevant to Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The study did not track glucose levels in different brain regions.

The researchers measured ratios of amino acids serine, glycine, and alanine to glucose to assess the activity of key steps in glycolysis. Enzyme activity was lower in Alzheimer's cases compared to normal tissue samples, and lower activity was linked to more severe Alzheimer's pathology and symptoms. The study suggests a new mechanism that could be targeted for treatment development.

1162,"The average Dane will gain a health benefit from substituting part of the red and processed meat in their diet with fish, according to calculations from the National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark. Men over 50 and women of childbearing age in particular would benefit from such a change in diet.

In a PhD study at the National Food Institute, Sofie Theresa Thomsen has developed a method to calculate the total health impact of replacing one food with another in the diet. The method has been used to assess the health impact that would be achieved by replacing red and processed meat with fish, so the intake reaches the recommended weekly intake of 350 grams of fish.

Fish is an important source of healthy fatty acids and vitamin D, but may also contain potentially harmful substances such as methylmercury. Red and processed meat contributes to the intake of saturated fat in the Danish diet and is associated with the development of different types of cancer, but red meat is also an important source of e.g. dietary iron. Replacing red and processed meat with fish in the Danish diet can therefore have a health impact on human health.

Seven thousand healthy years of life to be gained annually

Risk-benefit assessments weigh up the beneficial and adverse health effects by estimating how many healthy years of life a population gains because of health improvements, or lose due to reduced quality of life or by dying earlier than expected.

This is exactly what Sofie Theresa Thomsen has done in her calculations.

""They show that the Danish population as a whole can gain up to 7,000 healthy years of life annually, if all adult Danes eat fish in the recommended quantities while at the same time reducing their meat intake. This estimate covers among others the prevention of approximately 170 deaths from coronary heart disease per year,"" she says.

However, the health benefit depends on the type of fish people put on their plates, as well as the age and sex of the persons whose diet is being altered.

Go easy on the tuna

The greatest health benefit comes from eating only fatty fish (such as herring and mackerel) or a mixture of fatty and lean fish (such as plaice and pollock), while a smaller health gain is achieved by eating only lean fish. This is because fatty fish contain larger amounts of beneficial fatty acids.

On the other hand, the calculations show a significant health loss if tuna is the only type of fish in the diet, because tuna is both low in beneficial fatty acids and can have high concentrations of methylmercury. The health loss is calculated as particularly high among women of childbearing age, as intake of fish with a high concentration of methylmercury can damage unborn children's brain development.

Furthermore, the study shows that it is possible to reduce the proportion of Danes who have an insufficient intake of vitamin D significantly by replacing some of the red and processed meat with a mixture of fatty and lean fish. The study also points out that the proportion of Danes with an insufficient intake of dietary iron will not increase despite the lowered meat intake.

Greatest effect among men over 50 and childbearing women

The study shows large variations in the overall health impact when the red and processed meat gives way to fish. Everyone over the age of 50 -- but the men in particular -- as well as women of childbearing age will reap the greatest health benefits from eating 350 grams of fish weekly, of which 200 grams are fatty fish.

For men, this is because the group as a whole is at higher risk than other population groups of developing cardiovascular disease. The risk is reduced by replacing part of the red meat with fish that contain fatty acids, which can prevent cardiovascular disease.

""In women of childbearing age the health benefit is particularly large because the intake of fish containing healthy fish oils will not only benefit the women themselves. The health-promoting properties of fish will also have a beneficial effect in the development of their unborn children, which is taken into account in the overall calculations,"" Sofie Theresa Thomsen explains.

Useful when developed intervention strategies and dietary advice

The methods developed in the PhD study are useful e.g. when examining the health effects of various interventions designed to promote healthy eating habits or when developing official dietary guidelines.",0
1163,"Aug. 8, 2022 – BioNTech expects to begin deliveries of two Omicron-adapted vaccines as soon as October.

The German biotech firm, which makes the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, announced the update Monday as it reaffirmed its vaccine revenue forecast for the year, according to The Associated Press.

BioNTech is expanding its COVID-19 product pipeline to aim for “prolonged and broad protection,” Ugur Sahin, MD, the company’s CEO and co-founder, said during the earnings call.

BioNTech and Pfizer have delivered 3.6 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to 180 countries and territories. About 1.5 billion doses have gone to low- and middle-income countries.

Demand is decreasing in Western countries, where many people have received two to four shots by now, the AP reported.

But booster campaigns with updated shots that target Omicron variants are expected to increase demand this fall. Pending regulatory approval, both adapted vaccines will be available in time for fall booster campaigns, BioNTech said.

""Regular physical activity seemed to be related to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, says Garcia-Hermosa. ""There is evidence that regular physical activity might contribute to a more effective immune response, providing enhanced protective immunity to infections, which could explain the relationship between exercise consistency with COVID-19 infection."" Regular exercise may also help to boost the body’s anti-inflammatory responses, as well as cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, all of which may explain its beneficial effects on COVID-19 severity, the researchers say. ""I hope that the findings from our study give people a good reason to be physically active. Everybody can benefit from being more active, regardless of age, sex or physical ability. People who do not normally exercise should understand that all physical activity is beneficial … It can be done as part of work, sport and leisure or transport (walking, wheeling and cycling), but also through dance, play and everyday household tasks, like gardening and cleaning,"" Garcia-Hermosa says. The study was published online August 22 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. A growing body of evidence suggests that increased physical activity may regulate the course of COVID-19 infection and reduce the risk of bad outcomes. The new analysis is the first to systematically evaluate and pool data on the effect of regular physical activity on COVID-19 outcomes. The findings are based on data from 16 studies with over 1.8 million adults (53% women, average age 53 years). Individuals who included regular physical activity in their weekly routine had an 11% lower risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. ,

They also had a 36% lower risk of being hospitalized, a 44% lower risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and a 43% lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than their inactive peers. The greatest protective effect occurs with the equivalent to 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, with no added benefit beyond this level. While the study had some limitations – the analysis included observational studies and differing study designs, for instance – the researchers say their findings “may help guide physicians and healthcare policymakers in making recommendations and developing guidelines with respect to the degree of physical activity that can help reduce the risk of infectivity, hospitalization, severity and mortality of COVID-19 at both the individual and the population level, especially in high-risk patients.” Sean Heffron, MD, preventative cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York City says the study “supports the well-established non-linear association of increasing physical activity with adverse outcomes from a diverse array of diseases, including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.” The observation is not particularly surprising, he says. “It is as I would suspect. They compiled data from a large number of studies published over the past several years that all had consistent findings,” Heffron says. “The take away from a public health standpoint is that being physically active improves health in myriad ways. That being said, it is not a[cure-all] , so additional measures (masking, vaccinations, etc.) are important for everyone,” he says. Also weighing in, Joseph Herrera, DO, chair of the Department of Rehabilitation for Mount Sinai Health System in New York, says, “If you are physically fit, your body is more resilient and better prepared to handle the stressors of COVID or any other disease process.” But for now , the question of whether physical fitness is actually protective against COVID remains unclear. “I'm just not sure right now,” Herrera says. He says he’s seen athletes in professional sports – including the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) – and some of them have had long COVID and have not returned to play. “These are athletes at the peak of fitness and their career.”",0
1165,"ROCHESTER, Minn. — July is Sarcoma Awareness Month, bringing attention to a group of cancers that begin in the bones or soft tissues of the body. There are more than 70 types of sarcoma, including bone cancer. Treatments for bone cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or proton beam therapy that targets the cancer.

Proton beam therapy is a type of radiation therapy that is more precise than traditional X-ray treatment that delivers radiation to everything in its path. Proton beam therapy uses charged particles in an atom — protons — that release their energy within the tumor. Because proton beams can be much more finely controlled, specialists can use proton beam therapy to safely deliver higher doses of radiation to tumors. This is especially important for bone cancers.

""Bone tumors need much higher doses of radiation than a sarcoma that arises purely in the muscle, which we call a soft tissue sarcoma,"" says Safia Ahmed, M.D., a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic. ""These high doses of radiation often exceed what the normal tissues around the area can tolerate. Proton therapy allows us to give this high dose of radiation while protecting the normal tissues.""

Bone cancer is rare, accounting for just 0.2% of all cancers. Some types of bone cancer occur mainly in children, while others affect mostly adults. Common bone cancers include Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma. The most common sites include the pelvis, spine and base of the skull.

Whether a patient with bone cancer is a candidate for proton beam therapy depends on several factors, Dr. Ahmed says. The care team considers the patient's overall treatment plan, age, location of the cancer, the tissue surrounding the cancer, and potential benefits and risks from a high dose of radiation.

Proton beam therapy has side effects. Some are acute, such as fatigue, changes in the skin and pain if the tumor swells and presses on nerves. Long-term side effects include permanent damage to nerves or nearby organs, bone fractures, or the possibility of developing another cancer.

Before getting proton beam therapy, patients go through a simulation, which is essentially a dress rehearsal of how the radiation will go. The purpose is to identify the proper treatment position for the therapy since the radiation is so focused and precise, Dr. Ahmed says. The team uses custom immobilization devices, getting CT scans and MRI images as they develop the patient's radiation plan. Patients also received a small blue tattoo — about the size of a small mole— on the area of the tumor to help with positioning.

""We are very meticulous about it because we want to come up with the best radiation plan that is safe and effective for patients,"" Dr. Ahmed says. ""Once that process is done and the patient is ready to start, they come in daily for treatments. It's all about precision.""

Patients typically undergo proton beam therapy five days per week for several weeks, with several more weeks of recovery. The care team continues to monitor the patients who receive regular scans.

""Unfortunately, there's always concern about the cancer returning,"" Dr. Ahmed says. ""But we've made so much progress with all of our treatments. Our survival outcomes and efficacy have improved and continue to improve.""

For more information on how proton beam therapy for bone cancer spares surrounding tissue, follow the link to the Q&A podcast on the Mayo Clinic News Network.

When you quit smoking, you will have both physical and mental withdrawals. You may crave cigarettes, feel irritable and hungry, cough often, get headaches, or have difficulty concentrating. You have these symptoms of withdrawal because your body is used to nicotine. When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first 2 weeks after quitting, stay in control. Think about your reasons for quitting. Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without nicotine. The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary. They are strongest when you first quit but will go away within 10 to 14 days. Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases that smoking can cause. You may still have the desire to smoke, since there are many strong associations with smoking. The best way to overcome these associations is to enjoy them without smoking.

1169,"Jan. 17, 2023 – On Twitter, as in real life, it’s a question on many minds: When should we think about the next COVID-19 vaccine? Or should we? For some people who have received a two-dose primary series and all the recommended boosters, that could mean a sixth shot since COVID-19 vaccines became available. But is even that enough (or too much)? At this point, no one knows for sure, but new guidance may be on the docket. On Jan. 26, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting. On the agenda is discussion about plans for future vaccinations for COVID-19.The committee, made up of external advisers, evaluates data on vaccines and other products for the agency. According to the FDA announcement, after the meeting, “the FDA will consider whether to recommend adjustments to the current authorizations and approvals, and the FDA will consider the most efficient and transparent process to use for selection of strains for inclusion in the primary and booster vaccines.” From there, the CDC will take up the issue and decide on recommendations. The issue is important, as more than 550 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19, as of the week ending Jan. 13, the CDC reported. That’s up from 346 a day for the week ending Dec. 28. Yet, uptake of the newest vaccine, the bivalent booster, has been slow. As of Jan 11, just 15.9% of the population 5 years and up has gotten it; for those most vulnerable to COVID19 – those 65 and up – the number is just 39%. Meanwhile, infectious disease experts have widely differing views on what the vaccination landscape of 2023 and beyond should look like. Among the areas of disagreement are how effective the bivalent vaccine is, which people most need another shot, and what type of vaccine is best. “I think we probably will need another booster,” says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, and co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. “The question is, what is it going to be? Is it going to be the same bivalent that we just got, or will it be a new bivalent or even a trivalent?”

The trivalent booster, he suggested, might include something more protective against XBB.1.5. The bivalent booster gives “broadened immunity” that is improved from the original booster shots, says Eric Topol, MD, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, CA, and editor-in-chief of Medscape, WebMD’s sister site for health professionals. In his publication Ground Truths, Topol on Jan. 11 explained how new data caused him to reverse his previously skeptical view of how the FDA authorized the bivalent vaccine in September without data on how it affected humans at the time. Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is a member of the FDA advisory committee for vaccines. He still takes a dimmer view of more bivalent booster vaccines, at least as a blanket recommendation. While he acknowledges that boosters can help some groups – such as older adults, people with multiple health conditions, and those with compromised immune systems – he opposes a recommendation that’s population-wide. “People who fall into those three groups do benefit,” he says, “but the recommendation is everyone over 6 months get the bivalent, and what I’m asking is, ‘Where is the data that a healthy 12-year-old boy needs a booster to stay out of the hospital?’” “We are trying to understand how to stay one step ahead rather than several steps behind [the virus],“ says Michael Osterholm, PhD, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Among the key questions: How well can a vaccine work against a single subvariant, when no one can say for sure what the next predominant subvariant will be? Much more research has become available recently about the bivalent vaccine and its effectiveness, Osterholm says. “The bivalent vaccine is working as well as we could have expected,” he says, especially in high-risk people and in those over age 65. The challenge we have is, what does that mean going forward?” In his review, Topol concludes: “There is now more than ample, highly consistent evidence via lab studies and clinical outcomes to support the bivalent’s benefit over the original booster.”

Among other evidence, he looked at eight studies, including four that used a live virus as part of the research. Six of the eight studies showed the bivalent booster is more effective against the BA.5 variant, compared to the original booster shots. Two others showed no real difference. “The four live virus studies offer consistent evidence of broadened immunity for the BA.5 vaccine that is improved over the original booster shots,” Topol wrote. The evidence also found the bivalent antibody response superior against XBB, he wrote. Topol also cited CDC data that supports the benefits of the bivalent shot on hospitalization in older adults. During November, hospitalization of adults 65 and above was 2.5 times higher for those vaccinated who did not get the booster, compared to those who got the updated bivalent booster. Boosters do matter, Offit says. “But not for all.” In a perspective published Jan. 11 in The New England Journal of Medicine – the same issue that published the two studies finding few differences between the original and bivalent – Offit wrote that boosting is best reserved for vulnerable groups. Chasing the variants with a bivalent vaccine, he says, “has not panned out. There remains no evidence that a bivalent vaccine is any better than what we had. Please, show me the data that one is better than the other.” Offit believes the goal should not be to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them “with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later.” The CDC needs to parse the data by subgroups, Offit says. “The critical question is, ‘Who gets hospitalized and who is dying? Who are they?’” That data should take into account age, ethnicity, vaccine history, and other factors, Offit says, because right now, there is no great data to say, “OK, everyone gets a boost.” Another debate – for not only current boosters but future ones, too – centers on cost. Without congressional action to fund more vaccines, vaccine makers have suggested their prices may reach $130 a dose, compared to the average $20-per-dose cost the federal government pays now, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report.

The government has spent more than $30 billion on COVID-19 vaccines, including the bivalent, to provide them free of charge. The suggested price increase infuriated many. On Jan. 10, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), incoming chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, sent a letter to Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel, urging him to reconsider and refrain from any price increase. “The huge increase in price that you have proposed will have a significantly negative impact on the budgets of Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs that will continue covering the vaccine without cost-sharing for patients.” He pointed out, too, the $19 billion in profits Moderna has made over the past 2 years. While most people with health insurance would likely still get the vaccines and booster for free, according to the Kaiser analysis, will a higher price discourage people from keeping up with recommended vaccinations, including a possible new booster? “I think so, yes,” Hotez says, noting that vaccine reluctance is high as it is, even with free vaccinations and easy access. “The government is balking at paying for the boosters,” he says. “I think it’s very tone deaf from the pharmaceutical companies [to increase the price]. Given all the help they’ve gotten from the American people, I think they should not be gouging at this point.” He noted that the federal government provided not just money to the companies for the vaccines, but a “glide path” through the FDA for the vaccine approvals. Are Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and others developing more variant-specific vaccines, boosters, or other advances? Novavax, approved in July 2022 as a primary series and in some cases as a booster, is “also developing an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine at the direction of public health agencies,” says spokesperson Alison Chartan. Pfizer responded: “When and if we have something to share we will let you know.”",0

1175,"Feb. 8, 2023 -- Gout in people who have a brother, father, sister, or mother with the condition, a form of arthritis that often causes sudden, severe pain in the joints, is mostly driven by genetic makeup but can worsen significantly if they also drink heavily or carry excess weight. Although gout can affect anyone, having a first-degree relative with the condition raises risk by nearly two-and-a-half times compared to someone without an affected first-degree relative. Results from a recent study carried out among people in South Korea looked at the possible reasons for gout when it runs in families. They asked whether it was driven by genetics, or behavior such as high alcohol consumption, or possible lifestyle that might lead to being overweight or having obesity. Gout occurs when levels of uric acid in the blood are high, leading to the collection of sharp crystals in and around the joints that cause sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, often in the big toe. More than 8 million Americans have gout, and it occurs more often in men than in women. The study, which was published in Arthritis Care and Research, the journal of the American College of Rheumatology, also found that in people who have both a first-degree relative with gout and carry excess weight, their risk of gout rises to between four to over six times that of the general population without gout in the family or a high body mass index, or BMI. The risk rises with the amount of excess weight and is highest in individuals with obesity, or a BMI that's 30.0 or higher. If someone is a heavy drinker and they have a first-degree relative with gout, then their risk increases nearly three times that of the general population without gout or a tendency to heavy drinking. The link with food and drink comes from the buildup of uric acid in the blood, which is a breakdown product of purine, a chemical found in certain foods including beer and wine, liver and other organ meats, some seafoods and fructose-containing soft drinks.

""This suggests that most of the familial impact is in fact genetic rather than due to shared environmental factors and is an important finding,"" says Abhishek Abhishek, MD, a professor of rheumatology at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the U.K. ""People with a first-degree relative with gout should minimize their alcohol intake and maintain a healthy body weight to reduce their risk of developing gout in the future,"" he says. Abhishek notes that an ""aggressive management of excess weight and high alcohol consumption may prevent the onset of gout or improve its outcomes in those that already have this condition."" Among individuals with an affected brother, they had a three times greater risk than someone without an affected brother. Those whose father had the condition had a nearly 2.5 times higher risk, while those with a sister with gout had nearly twice the risk. Those whose mother had gout had just over 1.5 times the risk of someone whose mother did not have gout. ""People just need to lay off the alcohol to reduce risk of gout. We don't get to choose our parents, so most of us should reduce our weight and minimize alcohol,"" says Bruce Rothschild, MD, a professor of medicine at IU Health and a research associate at Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, PA.",0
1176,"In the last decade, scientists discovered that blocking a key regulator of the immune system helped unleash the body's natural defenses against several forms of cancer, opening up a new era of cancer immunotherapy. Now Yale scientists have essentially flipped this script and found that when impaired a molecularly similar regulator can cause the damaging immune system attacks on skin and organs that are the hallmark of the autoimmune disease lupus, they report Dec. 11 in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The study results help explain the origins of lupus and suggest novel ways researchers might be able to restore function of this inhibitor and provide much needed new therapy to treat the disease, the scientists said.

The immune system has a series of regulators designed to prevent it from attacking tissues in its host, a system that goes awry in autoimmune diseases. Yale researchers found that mice lacking an immune system inhibitor called programmed death-1 homolog, or PD-1H, spontaneously developed symptoms that resemble two forms of lupus -- systemic, in which the immune system attacks multiple organs; and cutaneous, which is marked by pronounced skin deformities.

""This molecule is clearly involved in inhibiting lupus, but it seems to be selective because it does not have the same effect in several other autoimmune diseases,"" said senior author Lieping Chen, the United Technologies Corporation Professor in Cancer Research, and professor of immunobiology, dermatology, and medicine.

PD-1H is molecularly similar to the more commonly known PD-1 molecule, which also helps suppress immune system response. Chen was a pioneer in identifying and developing inhibitors to PD-1, which freed T cells to attack several forms of cancer. Several labs have also tried to use PD-1H as a cancer treatment but so far have been unsuccessful.

Chen said his findings suggest that in people with lupus the function of PD-1H is critical. When it is impaired, they are vulnerable to the immune system attacks on skin and multiple organs that are the hallmark of the disease.

Lupus patients currently have very limited options for treatment, but the new findings suggest a novel approach called protein fusion might mimic PD-1H and help control the immune system and combat the disease, Chen said.",0

1183,"Indiana University School of Medicine researchers have identified a new therapeutic target that could lead to more effective treatment of glaucoma.

Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that causes vision loss and blindness due to a damaged optic nerve. More than 200,000 people are affected by glaucoma in the United States each year. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment. In a newly published paper in Communications Biology, researchers found neurons use mitochondria for a steady source of energy, and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis in the diseased neurons can protect the optic nerve cells from being damaged.

""Age-related neurodegenerative disease, which includes glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is the biggest global health problem,"" said Arupratan Das, PhD, assistant professor of ophthalmology and principal investigator of the study. ""The fundamental mechanisms that we discovered can be used to protect neurons in glaucoma and be tested for the other diseases. We have identified a critical step of complex mitochondrial homeostasis process, which rejuvenates the dying neuron, similar to giving a lifeline to a dying person.""

The research team, led by Michelle Surma and Kavitha Anbarasu from the Department of Ophthalmology, used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with and without glaucoma as well as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) engineered human embryonic stem cells with glaucoma mutation. Using stem cell differentiated retinal ganglion cells (hRGCs) of the optic nerve, electron microscopy and metabolic analysis, researchers identified glaucomatous retinal ganglion cells suffer mitochondrial deficiency with more metabolic burden on each mitochondrion. This leads to mitochondrial damage and degeneration. Mitochondria are the tube like structures in cells which produce adenosine triphosphate, cell's energy source.

However, the process could be reversed by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis by a pharmacological agent. The team showed retinal ganglion cells are highly efficient in degrading bad mitochondria, but at the same time producing more to maintain homeostasis.

""Finding that retinal ganglion cells with glaucoma produce more adenosine triphosphate even with less mitochondria was astonishing,"" Das said. ""However, when triggered to produce more mitochondria, the adenosine triphosphate production load was distributed among more mitochondrion which restored the organelle physiology. It is similar to a situation where a heavy stone is carried by fewer people versus a greater number of people -- each person will have less pain and injury, just like each mitochondrion will have less difficulty and damage.""

In the future, Das would like to test if these mechanisms protect the optic nerve in animal models under injury before testing in humans to hopefully lead to new clinical interventions.",0

• A new study from the American Heart Association (AHA) finds only 20% of Americans have optimal heart health.
• They also say measures to improve heart health can reduce your risk of bad health outcomes New from the American Heart Association (AHA), finds only 20% of Americans have ‘optimal’ heart health. “I think what’s interesting and important about this study is it gives us a much more granular look at the components of cardiovascular health in the U.S. population, and how those differ by demographic groups across age, between men and women, across race/ethnic groups,” study leader and AHA president, , told Healthline.

Study participants ranged from 2 to 79 years old For this study, researchers analyzed data from the (NHANES) from 2013 to 2018. They included non-pregnant, non-institutionalized individuals from 2 to 79 years old who had no cardiovascular disease. All participants had an overall cardiovascular health (CVH) score calculated for them ranging from 0 to 100, and a score for diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep duration, body mass index (BMI), blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure, using AHA definitions. According to updated metrics, among over 23,400 American adults and children without cardiovascular disease (CVD), the overall cardiovascular health of the U.S. population is not ideal. The research showed roughly 80% of people scored at a low or moderate level.

New evidence used to create a broader spectrum of heart health According to the AHA, they relied on “substantial new evidence” gathered over the last 12 years, to add new definitions and metrics for quantifying cardiovascular health (CVH). They also expanded the spectrum of CVH to begin from age two and address (SDOH), psychological health, and well-being as crucial factors to improve health. AHA’s metric for considering CVH is now called . “So we actually considered including sleep back in 2010,” said Lloyd-Jones. “We also considered things about stress that might be included, but at the time, neither of those was really measured very well, especially in population studies.” Lloyd-Jones pointed out that sleep is related to total mortality, and there is independent information that sleep gives us “above and beyond” the original seven metrics.

Mitchell Weinberg, MD, chair of cardiology at Staten Island University Hospital, part of Northwell Health in New York said this tool is both valuable and patient friendly for determining CVH. “Possessing one number that crystallizes a person’s current health status enables that individual to comprehend the need for change and target a single numeric goal,” he said. Weinberg said that Life’s Essential 8 provides motivation for an individual patient to improve and maintain their cardiovascular health. Weinberg also believes this tool is very useful for those focusing their efforts on a “grander scale.” “Cardiovascular health in the U.S. clearly requires drastic improvement and we need to think beyond the individual patient if we are to make adequate change,” he said. “Health systems, governments, payers, and policymakers can utilize such a validated tool to identify populations in need and track the effects of public health interventions,” he continued.

An opportunity to understand your current level of health Lloyd-Jones believes that Life’s Essential 8 will continue to provide an opportunity for people to understand their current health, and know what they can work on to maintain or improve it. “Across those eight metrics there’s going to be something in the yellow or red zone rather than in the green zone,” he said. “The good news is it doesn’t matter which one you pick, if you work on one of those eight things and try to improve it, it will improve your health.” Lloyd-Jones emphasized that this will reduce your risk of bad health outcomes, including CVD, cancer, and dementia. “Hopefully, it’s a very empowering message,” he said. “Let’s improve our health and by picking those things that you’re motivated to change, you can make a real impact on your long-term health outcomes.”",0
1187,"Stuffy noses, itching and fits of sneezing -- 130 million people in Europe suffer from hay fever and other forms of allergic rhinitis. Until now, these conditions have typically been diagnosed using blood samples or skin prick tests. The latter method is often seen as particularly uncomfortable because the skin is exposed to various allergens and punctured with a fine needle. Many patients -- especially children -- even find the blood test quite unpleasant.

Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann, a professor of environmental medicine at TUM and the director of the Institute of Environmental Medicine at the Helmholtz Zentrum München, has now tested a new diagnostic method for allergic rhinitis with her team. The scientists studied nasal smears using a method originally developed for blood samples: With a recent development in biochip technology, practitioners have been able for some time now to measure antibody concentrations for 112 different allergens with a single small blood sample.

Prof. Traidl-Hoffmann's team used this molecular diagnostics technology to measure concentrations of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood and nasal secretions of test subjects. These antibodies play a role in certain allergic responses. The researchers studied individuals with and without sensitization to the most common airborne allergens, including dust mite castings, grass pollen and the pollen of birch, hazelnut and alder trees.

For the same tests, the blood and nasal smears yielded similar results: They detected identical allergic sensitization patterns, i.e. the same sets of substances for which the body had developed an immune response. This was the case for all airborne allergens investigated. Previous studies had already demonstrated a link between the detection of allergy antibodies in the blood and in nasal secretions for certain aeroallergens. The researchers have now confirmed this correlation for a wide range of such allergens.

""A big advantage of allergy diagnostics with a nasal smear is that it is a good option for small children as compared to blood samples or skin prick testing. For that age group, a hyposensitization therapy is important because allergic rhinitis can develop into allergic asthma,"" says Prof. Claudia Traidl-Hoffmann. PD Dr. Stefanie Gilles adds: ""We also believe that, with nasal smears, IgE antibodies specific to certain allergies can be detected that cannot be measured in a blood sample. We now need to do further studies to explore that hypothesis.""",0
